Ah
yeah
Its
like
this
like
this
This
is
Eminem
baby
back
up
in
that
motherfucking
ass
Til
forever
til
forever
One
time
for
your
motherfuckin
mind
For
MCs
MCs
We
represent
the
313
you
know
what
Im
saying
Yo
they
dont
know
shit
about
this
for
the
96
Ayo
my
pen
and
paper
cause
a
chain
reaction
To
get
your
brain
relaxin
the
zany
actin
maniac
in
action
A
brainiac
in
fact
son
you
mainly
lack
attraction
You
look
insanely
wack
when
just
a
fraction
of
my
tracks
run
My
rhymin
skills
got
you
climbin
hills
I
travel
through
your
mind
and
chill
your
spine
like
siren
drills
Im
slimin
grills
of
roaches
with
spray
that
disinfects
And
twistin
necks
of
rappers
Til
their
spinal
column
disconnects
Put
this
in
decks
and
check
the
monologue
Turn
your
system
up
twist
em
up
And
indulge
in
the
marijuana
smog
This
is
the
season
for
noise
pollution
contamination
Examination
of
more
car-tunes
than
animation
My
lamination
of
narration
Hits
a
snare
and
bass
on
a
track
for
duck
rapper
interrogation
When
I
declare
invasion
There
aint
no
time
to
be
starin
gazin
I
turn
the
stage
into
a
barren
wasteland
Im
Infinite
you
heard
of
Hell
Well
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
Im
trying
to
repent
from
it
But
when
I
hear
the
beat
Im
tempted
To
make
another
attempt
at
it
Im
Infinite
Bust
it
I
let
the
beat
commence
So
I
can
beat
the
sense
in
your
elite
defense
I
got
some
meat
to
mince
A
crew
to
stomp
and
then
two
feet
to
rinse
I
greet
the
gents
and
ladies
I
spoil
loyal
fans
I
foil
plans
and
leave
fluids
leaking
like
oil
pans
My
coiled
hands
around
this
microphone
are
lethal
One
thought
in
my
cerebral
is
deeper
than
a
jeep-full
of
people
MCs
are
feeble
I
came
to
cause
some
pandemonium
Battle
a
band
of
phony
MCs
and
stand
the
lonely
one
Imitator
intimidator
stimulator
Simulator
of
data
eliminator
Theres
never
been
a
greater
since
the
burial
of
Jesus
Fuck
around
and
catch
all
the
venereal
diseases
My
thesisll
smash
a
stereo
to
pieces
My
a
cappella
releases
classic
masterpieces
Through
telekinesis
it
eases
you
mentally
Gently
sentimentally
instrumentally
With
entity
dementedly
meant
to
be
Infinite
Im
Infinite
you
heard
of
Hell
Well
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
Im
trying

But
when
I
hear

Im
tempted
To
make

it
Im
Infinite
Man
I
got
evidence
Im
never
dense
And
Ive
been
clever
ever
since
my
residence
was
hesitant
To
do
some
shit
that
represents
the
MO
So
Im
assuming
all
responsibility
Cause
theres
a
monster
will
in
me
That
always
wants
to
kill
MCs
Mic
nestler
slammin
like
a
wrestler
Here
to
make
a
mess
of
a
lyric
smuggling
embezzler
No
one
is
specialer
my
skill
is
intergalactical
I
get
cynical
act
a
fool
then
I
send
a
crew
back
to
school
I
never
packed
a
tool
or
acted
cool
it
wasnt
practical
Id
rather
let
a
tactical
tactful
track
tickle
your
fancy
In
fact
I
cant
see
or
cant
imagine
A
man
who
aint
a
lover
of
beats
or
a
fan
of
scratchin
So
this
is
for
my
family
the
kid
who
had
a
cameo
On
my
last
jam
plus
the
man
who
never
had
a
plan
B
Be
all
you
can
be
cause
once
you
make
an
instant
hit
Im
tensed
a
bit
and
tempted
When
I
see
the
sins
my
friends
commit
Im
Infinite
you
heard
of
Hell
Well
I
was
sent
from

I
went
to

For

Now
Im

Eminem
One
day
I
plan
to
be
a
family
man
happily
married
I
wanna
grow
to
be
so
old
that
I
have
to
be
carried
Till
Im
glad
to
be
buried
And
leave
this
crazy
world
And
have
at
least
a
half
a
million
for
my
baby
girl
It
may
be
early
to
be
planning
this
stuff
Cause
Im
still
struggling
hard
to
be
the
man
and
its
tough
Cause
man
its
been
rough
but
still
I
manage
enough
Ive
been
taken
advantage
of
damaged
and
scuffed
My
hands
have
been
cuffed
But
I
dont
panic
and
huff
frantic
and
puff
Or
plan
to
give
up
the
minute
shit
hits
the
fan
it
erupts
Im
anteing
up
double
or
nothing
Ive
been
trouble
enough
And
Im
sick
of
struggling
and
suffering
see
My
destinys
to
rest
at
ease
till
Im
impressed
and
pleased
With
my
progress
I
wont
settle
for
less
than
cheese
Im
on
a
quest
to
seize
all
my
own
label
to
call
Way
before
my
baby
is
able
to
crawl
Im
too
stable
to
fall
the
pressure
motivates
To
know
I
hold
the
weight
of
boulders
on
my
shoulder
blades
I
seen
the
golden
gates
to
heaven
on
Earth
Where
they
dont
pull
a
weapon
on
you
when
you
stepping
on
turf

Eminem
Im
going
for
broke
gambling
and
playing
for
keeps
Everyday
in
the
streets
scrambling
and
paying
for
cheep
Praying
for
sleep
Dreaming
with
a
watering
mouth
Wishing
for
a
better
life
for
my
daughter
and
spouse
In
this
slaughtering
house
caught
up
in
bouts
With
the
root
of
all
evil
Ive
seen
it
turn
beautiful
people
crude
and
deceitful
And
make
them
do
shit
illegal
For
these
Grants
and
Jacksons
These
transactions
explain
a
mans
actions
But
in
the
mist
of
this
insanity
I
found
my
Christianity
Through
God
and
theres
a
wish
he
granted
me
He
showed
me
how
to
cope
with
the
stress
And
hope
for
the
best
instead
of
mope
and
depressed
Always
groping
a
mess
of
flying
over
the
nest
To
selling
dope
with
the
rest
I
quit
smoking
cess
to
open
my
chest
Life
is
stressful
inside
this
cesspool
Trying
to
wrestle
I
almost
bust
a
blood
vessel
My
little
brothers
trying
to
learn
his
mathematics
Hes
asthmatic
running
home
from
school
away
from
crack
addicts
Kids
attract
static
children
with
automatics
Taking
target
practice
on
teens
for
Starter
Jackets
Im
using
smarter
tactics
to
overcome
this
slum
I
wont
become
as
dumb
as
some
and
succumb
to
scum
Its
cumbersome
Im
trying
to
do
well
on
this
Earth
But
its
been
Hell
on
this
Earth
since
I
fell
on
this
Earth

Yo
some
people
say
Im
whack
now
if
thats
right
Im
the
freshest
whack
MC
that
you
ever
heard
in
your
lifetime
My
slick
accapella
sounds
clever
with
the
beats
Boy
Im
the
deepest
thing
since
potholes
to
ever
hit
the
streets
Forgot
a
gold
diggers
succubus

my
souls
thick
with
ruggedness
With
the
mic
Im
like
a
dyke
cant
no
nigga
fuck
with
this
I
got
more
Different
Strokes
than
Philip
Drummound
On
open
mic
I
bone
your
women
just
to
keep
my
lyrics
coming
bitch
We
elevated
to
new
heights
premeditated
Let
it
be
that
I
stated
they
hate
it
now
that
they
see
that
I
made
it
The
escalated
can
be
put
to
the
test
of
greatness
Snatch
the
heart
from
MCs
and
I
ate
it
So
I
take
it
thats
the
reason
Im
hated
To
represent
my
temperment
If
rap
was
a
dick
all
you
so
called
hard
MCs
would
not
be
impitant
But
pimping
it
and
acting
like
you
could
rock
a
show
so
Harder
than
LLs
Rock
the
Bells
but
you
is
a
ho
now
Everything
that
you
collaborate
I
lacerate
My
rhymes
they
keep
coming
like
nympho
maniacs
that
masturbate
At
a
faster
rate
yeah
I
got
something
for
your
ass
to
hate
I
blasterate
and
have
you
all
running
master
gates
And
as
for
face
clutching
and
touching
the
flows
I
got
them
open
like
marijuana
smoke
up
in
your
nose
Bucking
these
hoes
I
got
that
shit
down
to
a
science
Leaving
them
hot
and
bothered
turned
on
like
an
appliance
Defiance
no
we
wont
have
that
You
want
your
shit
to
blow
up
Well
Ima
stuff
some
dynamite
in
your
ass
crack
And
blast
that
shit
to
kingdom
come
Then
bring
them
some
of
this
real
hip-hop
I
drop
beats
and
you
aint
singing
or
gonna
do
a
thing
about
And
you
all
knew
from
Meeko
That
you
couldnt
hold
your
own
with
the
strength
of
Lou
Forigno
So
stop
that
bullshit
and
flow
Yo
you
need

If

cowers
He
better
come
cleaner
then
Jay
Rue
jacking
off

You
flowers
got
no
clout
with

You
could
date
a
stick
of
dynamite
and
wouldnt
go
out
with
a
bang
I
showered
the
slang
simple
as
ABCs
Skip
over
the
Ds
and
rock
the
microphone
with
Es
Dethrone
MCs
and
Ima
max
alone
Relax
your
dome
like
a
solo
from
a
saxophone
So
facts
are
known
writers
get
treated
with
shocks
I
rock
a
beat
harder
then
you
could
beat
it
with
rocks
Im

You
couldnt

But
you
can
bring
yours
lets
see
what
you
got
But
dont
front
and
never
try
to
be

Cause

Hetero

We

To

Max
gaffling

I
grapple
an

baffling

The

stab
in

who
dabble
in
wax
Still
in
my
yard
when
I
sculpted
the
culprit
The
tall
shit
that
will
end
up
with
his
skull
split
Then
I
buried
the
hatchet
I
carried
on
my

Butterfingers
is
here
and
its
necessary
to
scratch
it
Baby
all
I

is
swallow

Smoke

Back

Ayo
biters
are
like
tarantulas
vandealous
Living
as
scandalous
as
a
television
evangelist
But
I
can
handle
this
Im
the
rhyme
biter
crime
fighter
Caped
crusader
taking
care
of
undeserving
lime
lighters
I
think
a
living
never
meant
for
me
Experimentally
I
found
a
way
to
spread
interamentally
When
I
stumbled
upon
this
resolution
By
using
a
special
fusion
of
chemical
solution
for
this
resolution
You
couldnt
see
me
with
binoculars
I
armed
like
an
octopus
Step
on
stage
and
you
get
socked
and
pushed
Talking
that
junk
like
you
went
black
guarded
your
back
Come
battle
me
and
you
get
smacked
as
hard
as
you
act
When
I
rap
I
represent
it
and
will
never
referee
in
it
Every
minute
so
when

Verse
3:
Eminem
is
heading
skyward
For
those
who
thought
that
I
would
make
you
bored
and
treat
you
like
a
piece
of
plywood
Ive
got
miracle
lyrical
capability
all
in
me
With
the
agility
to
escape
a
killer
bee
colony
So
get
your
cameras
and
capture
how
miraculous
I
rap
for
all
you
Draculas
and
showed
you
all
how
whack
you
was
I
meant
it
as
a
dis
cause
you
dont
posses
the
pizzazz
as
this
Im
hazardous
enough
already
as
it
is
Without
you
adding
fuel
to
the
fire
Im
cruel
to
the
liar
Who
fails
to
recognize
my
reign
of
hell
rule
to
the
sire
Clinical
studies
show
that
Im
cynical
Theres
no
one
whos
identical
to
my
fresh
and
authentic
flow
Im
sure
the
party
people
can
agree
That
Im
enchanting
with
the
romantic
Freaking
the
vocals
so
frantically
So
throw
your
hands
up
in
the
atmosphere
And
let
them
know
the
only
party
that
was
phat
was
here
just
be
like

Verse
1:
Eminem
I
know
this
crack
fiend
Maxine
who
needs
a
vaccine
She
tests
positive
but
tells
you
that
her
acts
clean
Plus
she
got
a
sugar
daddy
Asking
every
hooker
that
he
takes
in
to
crook
her
badly
If
you
mistook
her
sadly
on
her
reputation
Youre
in
jepordation
if
you
aint
got
no
preparation
When
you
step
away
son
she
got
her
face
done
Looking
provocative
shell
let
you
knock
it
if
You
press
the
issue
and
get
undressed
to
kiss
you
If
you
match
the
price
otherwise
she
wont
look
at
you
twice
But
when
you
catch
the
lice
or
get
the
urgency
To
go
to
the
emergency
cause
it
burns
to
pee
Dont
bring
your
germs
to
me
cause
I
aint
trying
to
hear
it
While
your
fighting
you
fucking
disease
trying
to
clear
it

Verse

Denaun
Porter
Sometimes
I
wonder
whats
your
purpose
In
life
that
is
To
get
with
every
brother
and
unveil
one
of
his
kids
shit
You
living
trife
got
three
kids
at
home
and
club
hopping
every
night
You
say
its
gonna
stop
but
it
just
slows
down
And
then
speeds
back
to
a
regular
pace
there
is
no
end
to
this
Mystery
whatever
your
reason
even
is
to
be
You
say
you
wanna
be
with
me
but
how
can
you
say
that
When
you
got
niggas
hiding
in
your
closet
I
refrain
from
getting
angry
but
you
keep
on
that
strangely
Verse

Ill

sacrifice
The

you
acting
slice
when
I
tear
your
back
with
knifes
Jacking
lifes
of
MCs
now
Im
set
to
launch
a
plan
For
blowing
up
the
stage
with
illegal
contraband
A
stomped
your
man
so
unless
you

what
he

You
better
set

Im
steaming

Ill

tea
hot
people
get
in
my
face
and
ask
If
I
wanna
battle
then
I
chase
them
in
a
Jason
mask
Its
an
amazing
task
to
battle
with
success
I
never
gave
a
fuck
now
I
give
a
fuck
less
And
in
a
slug
fest
I
get
physical
like
physicians
Invisible
like
magicians
with
mystical
mic
traditions
Wicked
wizardry
like
a
sorcerer
and
no
remorse
for
you
When
I
torture
you
throughout
the
course
of
my
orchestra
So
feel
the
force
of
my
spiritual
images
Slicing
up
an
enemys
appendages
till
he
hemorrhages
My
skin
itches
every
time
a
rapper
recites
And
when
hes
through
with
his
verse
Im
all
covered
in
flea
bites
You
wanna
see
fights
I
got
a
match
for
you
You
couldnt
flip

playing
in
toilets
with
a
spatula

Verse
1:
Eminem
Im
reminiscing
on
your
tenderness
and
the
snuggling
and
teasing
Missing
what
I
remember
kissing
and
hugging
and
squeezing
Bugging
and
weezing
Im
having
trouble
when
breathing
Its
even
tougher
when
sleeping
But
theres
a
couple
of
reasons
that
Im
suffering
and
grieving
For
loving
and
leaving
you
all
Im
thinking
of
in
the
evening
You
got
my
knees
buckling
and
weakening
Thoughts
of
nothing
but
freaking
that
Im
struggling
to
keep
in
And
interrupt
when
Im
speaking
I
got
some
game
that
Im
preparing
to
run
The
way
your
lips
sparkle
and
glare
in
the
sun
You
got
your
hair
in
a
bun
no
matter
what
youre
wearing
you
stun
Cause
your
comparing
to
none
I
wanna
share
in
the
fun
I
feel
a
passionate
lust
when
Im
imagining
just
us
alone
at
last
with
a
touch
I
see
you
grasping
to
trust
but
my
intentions
are
good
The
seed
is
passing
in
dust
Im
not
asking
to
rush
and
answer
immediately
I
just
wanna
be
there
for
you
and
you
to
be
there
for
me
If
you
agree
to
repeat
after
me
I
Love
You
I
love
you
baby
Cause
I
just
need
you
to
see
how
much
Im
eager
to
be
Your
man
legally
wed
your
loves
keeping
me
fed
This
is
easily
said
so
you
can
lead
or
be
led
If
you
care
to
be
down
cause
aint
nobody
Like
you
no
where
to
be
found

I

led
down
a

Sneezing
at

Inside

I
taste
lint
in

then
the
lights
in

I

my

flash
in

I
felt
a
butcher
knife
slash
at
one
of

None

knew
where
Im
at
I
was
doomed
Then
I

the

5:
Dealing

there

I
learned
Theyre

powerful
when

your

I
yearned
for
the
day
that
we
finally
met
again
So
I
can
give
him
a
taste
of
his
own
medicine
He
shed
his
skin
then
he
promised
to
come
clean
I
took
his
butcher
knife
and
jabbed
it
into
his
spleen
Cut
him
at
the
seam
then
dragged
the

home
Beating

Verse
1:
I
come
home
every
single
day
from
working
double
shifts
And
stop
along
the
way
to
pick
you
up
a
couple
gifts
I
come
inside
and
you
pretend
you
miss
me
when
you
kiss
me
Then
you
diss
me
and
we
strenuously
fight
continuously
Again
you
frisk
me
for
numbers
trying
to
bust
me
It
must
be
only
just
because
you
never
learned
to
trust
me
Plus
we
only
grovel
only
irrelevant
issues
To
many
tissues
for
my
feelings
you
misuse
I
buy
you
jewelry
you
make
a
fool
of
me
I
bring
you
diamond
rings
you
say
Im
bad
at
timing
things
So
whats
a
man
to
do
when
all
i
hand
to
you
is
handed
back
to
me
You
act
to
be
this
gangsta
bitch
that
aint
what
first
attracted
me
I
used
to
love
your
company
now
you
always
bugging
me
For
information
and
you
tell
your
friends
you
plan
on
dumping
me
So
Ima
wait
for
your
evacuation
Cause
every
accusation
makes
me
wanna
smack
your
face
in
See
Ive
never
been
so
sure
and
your
just
insecure
So
my
solution
to
your
jealousy
presents
a
cure
I
recommend
you
take
your
things
and
check
them
in
Look
at
the

I

It

you

Someone

And
youll
be
over

by
the

tomorrow
Leaving
me

Brandy
never

so
broken

I
fell

you

And

You

Take

quit

down
You
run
me
down
and
now
your
trying
to
apologize
For
all

and
everytime
you
made

What

life
Life
is
like
a
big
obstacle
put
in

of
your
optical
to
slow
you
down
And
everytime
you
think
you
gotten
past
it
its

come
back
around
and
tackle
you
to
the
damn
ground
What
are
friends
Friends
are
people
that
you
think
are
your
friends
But
they
really
your
enemies
with
secret
indentities
and
disguises
to
hide
they
true
colors
So
just
when
you
think
you
close
enough
to
be
brothers
they
wanna
come
back
and
cut
your
throat
when
you
aint
lookin
What

money
Money
is
what
makes
a
man
act

Money
is
the

Moneyll

Cuz
I

The

Chess
King
And
have
the
lady
at
the

Money

Smashed

When

I
ran
up

And
colliding
with

with

There

Post
Toasties
Stood
up

Too

siren
sounds
it
seemed
like
a
thousand
police
cars
Barely
escaped
must-a

some
dumb

Jumped
up
and
climbed
the
back
of
a
movin
dump
truck
But
I

Plus
I

Fuck

Way
before
my
baby
daughter
Hailey
I
was
harassed
daily
by
this
fat
kid
named
DAngelo
Bailey
An
eighth
grader
who
acted
obnoxious
cause
his
father
boxes
so
everyday
hed
shove
me
in
the
lockers
One
day
he
came
in
the
bathroom
while
I
was
pissin
And
had
me
in
the
position
to
beat
me
into
submission
He
banged
my
head
against
the
urinal
til
he
broke
my
nose
Soaked
my
clothes
in
blood
grabbed
me
and
choked
my
throat
I
tried
to
plead
and
tell
him
We
shouldnt
beef
But
he
just
wouldnt
leave
he
kept
chokin
me
and
I
couldnt
breathe
He
looked
at
me
and
said
You
gonna
die
honkey
The
principal
walked
in
Whats
going
on
in
here
and
started
helpin
him
stomp
me
I
made
them
think
they
beat
me
to
death
Holdin
my
breath
for
like
five
minutes
before
they
finally
left
Then
I
got
up
and
ran
to
the
janitors
storage
booth
Kicked
the
door
hinge
loose
and
ripped
out
the
four
inch
screws
Grabbed
some
sharp
objects
brooms
and
foreign
tools
This
is
for
every
time
you
took
my
orange
juice
or
stole
my
seat
in
the
lunchroom
and
drank
my
chocolate
milk
Every
time
you
tipped
my
tray
and
it
dropped
and
spilt
Im
gettin
you
back
bully
Now
once
and
for
good
I
cocked
the
broomstick
back
and
swung
hard
as
I
could
and
beat
him
over
the
head
with
it
til
I
broke
the
wood
Knocked
him
down
stood
on
his
chest
with
one
foot

Made
it
home
later
that
same
day
Started
reading
a
comic
and
suddenly
everything
became
gray
I
couldnt
even
see
what
I
was
tryin
to
read
I
went
deaf
and
my
left
ear
started
to
bleed
My
mother
started
screamin
What
are
you
on
drugs
Look
at
you
youre
gettin
blood
all
over
my
rug
Sorry
She
beat
me
over
the
head
with
the
remote
control
opened
a
hole
and
my
whole
brain
fell
out
of
my
skull
I
picked
it
up
and
screamed
Look
bitch
what
have
you
done
[M]
Oh
my
God
Im
sorry
son
[E]
Shut
up
you
cunt
I
said
Fuck

Took
it
and
stuck
it
back
up
in
my
head
then
I
sewed
it
shut
and
put
a
couple
of
screws
in
my
neck
Brain

Life
by
Marshall

What

life
Life
is
like
a

ground
What

friends
Friends
are
people
that
you
think
are
your
friends
But
they
really
your
enemies
with
secret
indentities
and
disguises
to
hide
they
true
colors
So
just
when
you
think
you
close
enough
to
be
brothers
they
wanna
come
back
and
cut
your
throat
when
you
aint
lookin
What
is
money
Money
is
what
makes

disgusting
he

It
like
makes
me
upset
and

I

did
drugs
That

President

Hillary
Clinton

Bitch
My

Im

Grabbed
Vanilla

Follow

smoke
weed
take
pills
drop
outta
school
kill
people
and
drink
And
jump
behind
the
wheel
like
it
was
still
legal
Im
dumb
enough
to
walk
in
a
store
and
steal
So
Im
dumb
enough
to
ask
for
a
date
with
Lauryn
Hill
Some
people
only
see
that
Im
white
ignorin
skill
Cause
I
stand
out
like
a
green
hat
with
a
orange
bill
But
I
dont
get
pissed
yall
dont
even
see
through
the
mist
How
the
fuck
can
I
be
white
I
dont
even
exist
I
get
a
clean
shave
bathe
go
to
a
rave
Die
from
an
overdose
and
dig
myself
up
out
of
my
grave
My
middle
finger
wont
go
down
how
do
I
wave
And
this
is
how
Im
supposed
to
teach
kids
how
to
behave
Now
follow
me
and
do
exactly
what
you
see
Dont

wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me
I
slap
women
and
eat
shrooms
then
OD
Now
dont
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me
Me

Marcus
Allen
went

Nicole
When

Killed

and
smeared

in
a
white
Bronco

My
mind
wont
work
if
my
spine
dont
jerk
I
slapped
Garth
Brooks
out
of
his
Rhinestone
shirt
Im
not
a

ill
rhyme
sayer
Thatll

Aerosol

Jumped

with
an
acorn

deformative
traits
A
premature
birth
that
was
four
minutes
late
Mother

you
over
the
head

shovel
Will

explain
to
my
brain
that
I
just
severed
a
main
vein
with
a
chainsaw
and
Im
in
pain
I
take
a
breather
and
sighed
either
Im
high
or
Im
nuts
Cause

So
when

around

tree
You

grow
up
to
be
just
like
me

This
song

All
the
happy
people
who
have
real
nice
lives
And
who
have
no
idea
whats
it
like
to
be
broke
as
fuck
Verse
One:
I
feel
like
Im
walking
a
tight
rope
without
a
circus
net
Im
popping
perkasets
Im
a
nervous
wreck
I
deserve
respect
but
I
work
a
sweat
for
this
worthless
check
Bout
to
burst
this
tech
at
somebody
to
reverse
this
debt
Minimum
wage
got
my
adrenaline
caged
Full
of
venom
and
rage
Especially
when
Im
engaged
And
my
daughters
down
to
her
last
diaper
Thats
got
my
ass
hyper
I
pray
that
god
answers
maybe
Ill
ask
nicer
Watching
ballers
while
they
flossing
in
their
pathfinders
These
overnight
stars
becoming
autograph
signers
Well
all
gone
blow
up
and
leave
the
past
behind
us
Along
with
the
small
frys
and
average
half
pinters
While
playa
haters
turn
bitch
like
they
have
vaginas
Cause
we
see
them
dollar
signs
and
let
the
cash
blind
us
Money
will
brainwash
you
and
leave
your
ass
mindless
Snakes
slither
in
the
grass
spineless
Chorus:
repeat
2X
Thats
Rock
Bottom
When
this
life
makes
you
mad
enough
to
kill
Thats
Rock
Bottom
When
you
want
something
bad
enough
youll
steal
Thats
Rock
Bottom
When
you
feel
you
have
had
it
up
to
here
Cause
you
mad
enough
to
scream
but
you
sad
enough
to
tear
Verse
Two:
My
life
is
full
of
empty
promises
And
broken
dreams
Im
hoping
things
will
look
up
But
there
aint
no
job
openings
I
feel
discouraged
hungry
and
malnourished
Living
in
this
house
with
no
furnace
unfurnished
And
Im
sick
of
working
dead
end
jobs
with
lame
pay
And
Im
tired
of
being
hired
and
fired
the
same
day
But
fuck
it
if
you
know
the
rules
to
the
game
play
Cause
when
we
die
we
know
were
all
going
the
same
way
Its
cool
to
be
player
but
it
sucks
to
be
the
fan
When
all
you
need
is
bucks
to
be
the
man
Plus
a
luxury
sedan
Too
comfortable
and
roomy
in
a
six
They
threw
me
in
the
mix
With
all
these
gloomy
lunatics
Walk
around
depressed
And
smoke
a
pound
of
ses
a
day
And
yesterday
went
by
so
quick
it
seems
like
it
was
just
today
My
daughter
wants
to
throw
the
ball
but
Im
too
stressed
to
play
Live
half
my
life
and
throw
the
rest
away
Chorus
Theres
people
that
love
me
and
people
that
hate
me
But
its
the
evil
that
made
me
this
backstabbing
deceitful
and
shady
I
want
the
money
the
women
the
fortune
and
the
fame
That
Means
Ill
end
up
burning
in
hell
scorching
in
flames
That
means
Im
stealing
your
checkbook
and
forging
your
name
Lifetime
bliss
for
eternal
torture
and
pain
Right
now
I
feel
like
just
hit
the
rock
bottom
I
got
problems
now
everybody
on
my
blocks
got
em
Im
screaming
like
those
two
cops
when
2pac
shot
em
Holding
two
glocks
I
hope
your
doors
got
new
locks
on
em
My
daughters
feet
aint
got
no
shoes
or
socks
on
em
And
them
rings
you
wearing
look
like
they
got
a
few
rocks
on
em
And
while
you
flaunting
them
I
could
be
taking
them
to
shops
to
pawn
them
I
got
a
couple
of
rings
and
a
brand
new
watch
you
want
em

Trials

Tribulations
That

When

test
us
When
someone
tries
our
patience
[Eminem]
I
hang
with
a
bunch
of
hippies
and
wacky
tobacco
planters
Who
swallow
lit
roaches
and
light
up
like
jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders
baby
and
we
suing
the
courts
Cuz
were
dope
as
fuck
and
only
get
a
2
in
the
source
They
never
shouldve
booted
me
out
of
reform
school
Deformed
fooltakin
a
shit
in
a
warm
pool
They
threw
me
out
the
Ramada
Inn
I
said
it
wasnt
me
I
got
a
twin
Oh
my
god
its
you
Not
again
It
all
started
when
my
mother
took
my
bike
away
Cuz
I
murdered
my
guinea
pig
and
stuck
him
in
the
microwave
After
that
It
was
straight
to
the
40
ouncers
Slappin
teachers
and
jackin
off
in
front
of
my
counselors
Class
clown
freshman
dressed
like
Les
Nessman
Fuck

Slim

Who

Yeah

walked
into
big
Tannys
and

on
Jenny
Craig
She
picked
me
up
to
snap
me
like
a
skinny
twig
Put
me
in
the
headlock
then
I
thought
of
my
guinea
pig
I
felt
the
evilness
and
started
transformin
RARRRR
It
began
storming
I
heard
a
bunch
of
cheering
fans
swarming
Grabbed
that
bitch
by
her
hair
Drug
her
across
the
ground
And
took
her
up
to
the
highest
diving
board
and
tossed
her
down
Sorry
coach
its
too
late
to
tell
me
stop
While
I
drop
this
bitch
face
down
and
watch
her
belly
flop
Chorus
As

These

Day

[Eminem]
We

While

Outsiders
and

Cuz

The

Hypercondriac

Where

Dressed

Thats

put

Wit
an
uppercut
and
hit
me
with
a
basket
of
laundry
I
fell
through
the
glass
doors
Started
causin
a
scene
Then
slid
across
the
floor
and
flew
right
into
a
washin
machine
Jumped
up
with
a
broken
back
Thank
god
I
was
smokin
crack
all
day
And
doped
up
off

and

All
I
wanted
to
do
was
rape
the
bitch
and
snatch
her
purse
Now
I
wanna
kill
her
But
so
I
gotta
catch
her
first
Ran
through
Rallys
parkin
lot
and
took
a
shortcut
Saw
the
house
she
ran
up
in
And
shot
her
fuckin
porch
up
Kicked
the
door
down
to
murder
this
divorced
slut
Looked
around
the
room
Thats
when
I
seen
the
bedroom
door
shut
I

there
bitch
I
got
my
gun
cocked
You

She
said
Come

unlocked
I
walked
in
and
all
I
smelled
was
Liz
Claiborne
And
seen
her
spread
across
the
bed
naked
watchin
gay
porn
She
said
Come
her
big
boy

get
acquainted
I
turned
around
to
run
twisted
my
ankle
and
sprained
it
She
came
at
me
at
full
speed
nothin
could
stop
her
I
shot
her
five
times
and
every
bullet
bounced
off
her
I
started
to
beg
No
please
let
go
But
she
swallowed
my
fuckin
leg
whole
like
an
egg
roll
With
one
leg
left
now
Im
hoppin
around
crippled
I
grabbed
my
pocket
knife
and
sliced
off
her
right
nipple
Just
trying
to
buy

some
time
then
I
remembered
this
magic
trick
Den

Whipped

I
shouted

Stuffed

Chorus
to

And

Throughout

days
of

We
all
face
small
obstacles
and
challenges
everyday
That

Every

[Cowboy]
I
reckon
you
aint
familiar
with
these
here
parts
You
know
theres
a
story
behind
that
there
saloon
Twenty
years
ago
two
outlaws
took
this
whole
town
over
Sheriffs
couldnt
stop
em
Quickest
damn
gun
slingers
Ive
ever
seen
Got
murdered
in
cold
blood
That
ol
saloon
there
was
their
lil
home
away
from
home
They
say
the
ghosts
of
Bad
and
Evil
still
live
in
that
tavern
And
on
a
quiet
night
You
can
still
hear
the
footsteps
of
Slim
Shady
and
Royce
Da
Five-Nine
[Eminem]
I
dont
speak
I
float
in
the
air
wrapped
in
a
sheet
Im
not
a
real
person
Im
a
ghost
trapped
in
a
beat
I
translate
when
my
voice
is
read
through
a
sismograph
And
a
noise
is
bred
picked
up
and
transmitted
through
Royces
head
AAHHH
Trapped
him
in
his
room
possessed
him
and
hoist
his
bed
Till
the
evilness
flows
through
his
blood
like
poisonous
lead
Told
him
each
one
of
his
boys
is
dead
I
asked
him
to
come
to
the
dark
side
he
made
a
choice
and
said
[Royce]
Who
hard
yo
I
done
heard
worse
We
can
get
in
two
cars
and
accelerate
at
each
other
To
see
which
onell
swerve
first
Two
blind
bandits
panic
whose
mental
capacity
holds
That
of
a
globe
on
top
of
nine
other
planets
Kissed
the
cheek
of
the
devil
Intelligence
level
is
hell-ier
than
treble
peakin
on
speakers
in
the
ghetto
Dismissal
Im
not
a
fair
man
disgraced
the
race
of
a
atheist
Intercepting
missles
wit
my
bare
hands
like
a
patriot
One
track
sliced
without
swords
I
buried
the
Christ
corpse
In
my
past
life
when
the
Black
Knight

And

the
Nazis
in
the
nations
Collaborating
attemptin
to

earth
[Eminem]
Cuz

Steve
Segal
Above

We

Jeep
Eagle
I

amounts
When
I
stab
myself
in

knee
with
a
diseased
needle
Releasin

Cold

rain
Hes

No

[Royce]
The
disaster
wit
dreds
Im
Bad
enough
to
commit
suicide
and
survive
long
enough
To
kill
my
soul
after
Im
dead
When
in
danger
its
funny
actually
my
flavors
similar
to
a
waiter
Cuz
I
serve
any
stranger
wit
money
I
spray
a
hundred
man
until
they
joint
chains
While
slippin
bullets
at

blank
range
like

was
punches
Piss
on
a
flag
and
burn
it
murder
you
then

your
funeral
Serve

lobbyist
strangle
your
body

citizens
Its

Got

Hell

A

Look

But

Good

Im
zonin
off
of

stoppin

Hopped

Come

A

blood
Emptyin

clips
and
buryin

in
the
mud
Ive
calmed
down
now
--
I
was
heavy
once
into
drugs
I
could
walk
around
straight
for
two
months
with
a
buzz
My
brains
gone
my
souls
worn
and
my
spirit
is
torn
The
rest
of
my
bodys
still
bein
operated
on
Im
ducked
the
fuck
down
while
Im
writin
this
rhyme
Cause
Im

Chorus:

[Eminem]
I

Got

Shittin

Causin

Chorus

post
office

Sometimes

but
anyways

whats
been
up
Man

If

her
Ima

Bonnie
I
read
about
your
Uncle
Ronnie
too
Im
sorry
I
had
a

kill
himself
over
some
bitch
who
didnt
want
him
I

this
everyday
but
Im
your

fan
I

the
underground
shit
that

with

full
of
your
posters
and
your
pictures

back
just
to

truly
yours
your
biggest
fan
This
is
Stan
My
teas
gone
cold
Im
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
cant
see
at

Dear
Slim
you
still
aint
called
or
wrote
I
hope
you
have
a
chance
I
aint
mad
-
I
just
think
its
FUCKED
UP
you
dont
answer
fans
If
you
didnt
wanna
talk
to
me
outside
your
concert
you
didnt
have
to
but
you
coulda
signed
an
autograph
for
Matthew
Thats
my
little
brother
man
hes
only
six
years
old
We
waited
in
the
blistering
cold
for
you
four
hours
and
you
just
said
No
Thats
pretty
shitty
man
-
youre
like
his
fuckin
idol
He
wants
to
be
just
like
you
man
he
likes
you
more
than
I
do
I
aint
that
mad
though
I
just
dont
like
being
lied
to
Remember
when
we
met
in
Denver
You
said
if
Id
write
you
you
would
write
back
See
Im
just
like
you
in
a
way
I
never
knew
my
father
neither
He
used
to
always
cheat
on
my
mom
and
beat
her
I
can
relate
to
what
youre
saying
in
your
songs
So
when
I
have
a
shitty
day
I
drift
away
and
put
em
on
Cause
I
dont
really
got
shit
else
So
that
shit
helps
when
Im
depressed
I
even
got
a
tattoo
of
your
name
across
the
chest
Sometimes
I
even
cut
myself
to
see
how
much
it
bleeds
Its
like
adrenaline
the
pain
is
such
a
sudden
rush
for
me
See
everything
you
say
is
real
And
I
respect
you
cause
you
tell
it
My
girlfriends
jealous
cause
I
talk
about
you
24/7
But
she
dont
know
you
like
I
know
you
Slim
no
one
does
She
dont
know
what
it
was
like
for
people
like
us
growin
up
You
gotta
call
me
man
Ill
be
the
biggest
fan
youll
ever
lose
sincerely
yours
Stan
PS
We
should
be
together
too

Hey

You

But

is
You
couldve
rescued
me
from
drowning
Now
its
too
late
Im
on
a
thousand
downers
now
Im
drowsy
And
all
I
wanted
was
a
lousy
letter
or

I
hope

I
ripped
all
of
your
pictures
off
the
wall
I
loved
you
Slim
we
couldve
been
together

think
about
it
You
ruined
it

I
hope
you
cant
sleep
and
you
dream
about
it
And
when
you
dream
I
hope
you
cant
sleep
and
you
scream
about
it
I
hope
your
conscience
eats
at
you
and
you
cant
breathe
without
me
See

tryin
to
talk

Im
wondering
why
I
got
out

The

rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
cant
see

And
even

but
your

it
on
a
Starter
cap
Im

Dont

Or

Go

their
17-year-old
Uncle
Im
like
Guidance
-
aint

got
the

moms
and
dads
who
got
mad
when
I
asked
if
they
liked
violence
And
told
me
that
my
tape
taught
em
to
swear
What
about
the
make-up
you
allow
your
12-year-old
daughter
to

Hmm
So
tell
me
that
your
son
doesnt

Go

And

the
first
word
I
ever

MC
on

--
on
this
Earth
And
since

Ive
been
cursed
with
this
curse
to
just
curse
And
just
blurt
this
berserk
and
bizarre
shit
that
works
And
it
sells
and
it
helps
in
itself
to
relieve
all
this
tension
dispensin
these
sentences
Gettin
this
stress
thats
been
eatin
me
recently
off
of
this
chest
and
I
rest
again
peacefully
peacefully
but
at
least
have
the
decency
in
you
to
leave
me
alone
when
you
freaks
see
me
out
in
the
streets
when
Im
eatin
or
feedin
my
daughter
to
not
come
and
speak
to

a
prick
if

my
tank

empty
No
patience
is
in
me
and
if
you
offend
me
Im
liftin

feet
liftin
you
10
feet
in
the

I

Go

Ill

a
wardrobe
Im

Chorus:
Eminem
And
I
am
whatever
you
say
I

If

would
I
say
I

In
the

Radio
wont
even
play
my
jam
Cause
I

In

I
dont

its
just
the
way

[Eminem]
Sometimes
I
just
feel
like
my
father
I
hate
to
be
bothered
with
all
of
this
nonsense
its
constant
And
Oh
its
his
lyrical
content
-
-
the
song
Guilty
Conscience
has
gotten
such
rotten
responses
And
all
of
this
controversy
circles
me
and
it
seems
like
the
media
immediately
points
a
finger
at
me
finger
at
me
So
I
point
one
back
at
em
but
not
the
index
or
pinkie
or
the
ring
or
the
thumb
its
the
one
you
put
up
when
you
dont
give
a
fuck
when
you
wont
just
put
up
with
the
bullshit
they
pull
cause
they
full
of
shit
too
When
a
dudes
gettin
bullied
and
shoots
up
his
school
and
they
blame
it
on
Marilyn
on
Marilyn
and
the
heroin
Where
were
the
parents
at
And
look
where
its
at
Middle
America
now
its
a
tragedy
Now
its
so
sad
to
see
an
upper
class
ci-ty
havin
this
happenin
this
happenin
then
attack
Eminem
cause
I
rap
this
way

way
But
Im
glad
cause
they
feed
me
the
fuel
that
I
need
for
the
fire
to
burn
and
its
burnin
and
I
have
returned
Chorus
[Eminem]
Im

my
label
and
stop

the
fables
Im

these
cocky
caucasians

Were

Yall

a
white
person
before
Jaws

the
floor

Tommy

They

And
Dr

basement
Ha-ha
Feminist
women

Eminem
Slim
Shady
Im
sick
of
him
Look
at
him
walking
around
grabbing
his
you-know-what
Flipping
the
you-know-who
yeah
but
hes
so
cute
though
Yeah
I
probably
got
a
couple
of
screws
up
in
my
head
loose
But
no
worse
than
whats
going
on
in
your
parents
bedrooms
Sometimes
I
wanna
get
on
TV
and
just
let
loose
but
cant
But
its
cool
for
Tom
Green
to
hump
a
dead
moose
My
bum
is
on
your
lips
my
bum
is
on
your
lips
And
if
Im
lucky
you
might
just
give
it
a
little
kiss
And
thats
the
message
that
we
deliver
to
little
kids
And
expect
them
not
to
know
what
a
womans
clitoris
is
Of
course
they
gonna
know
what
intercourse
is
By
the
time
they
hit
fourth
grade
They
got
the
Discovery
Channel
dont
they
We
aint
nothing
but
mammals
Well
some
of
us
cannibals
Who
cut
other
people
open
like
cantaloupes
But
if
we
can
hump
dead
animals
and
antelopes
Then
theres
no
reason
that
a
man
and
another
man
cant
elope
But
if
you
feel
like
I
feel
I
got
the
anecdote
Women

each
individual
degenerates
head
and
reach
into
it
Just
to
see
if

influenced
by
me
if
he
listens
to

And
if
he
feeds
into
this
shit
hes
an
innocent
victim
And
becomes
a
puppet
on
the
string
of
my
tennis

Sheez

Mind

And
by
the
way
NSYNC
why
do

Should

care
what
yall

Lip

Its
why
I

So
I
just
throw

Longer

Aiyyo
this

my
love
song

goes
like
this
Back
when
Mark
Walhberg
was
Marky
Mark
This
is
how
we
used
to
make
the
party
start
We
used
to
mix
Hen
with
Bacardi
Dark
And
when
it
kicks
in
you
can
hardly
talk
And
by
the
sixth
gin
youre
gon
probably
crawl
And
youll
be
sick
then
and
youll
probably
barf
And
my
pre-diction
is
youre
gon
probably
fall
either
somewhere
in
the
lobby
or
the
hallway
wall
And
every-things
spinnin
youre
beginnin
to
think
women
are
swimmin
in
pink
linen
again
in
the
sink
Then
in
a
couple
of
minutes
that
bottle
of
Guinness
is
finished
You
are
now
allowed
to
officially
slap
bitches
You
have
the
right
to
remain
violent
and
start
wilin
Start
a
fight
with
the
same
guy
that
was
smart
eyein
you
Get
in
your
car
start
it
and
start
drivin
over
the
island
and
cause
a
42
car
pile-up
{spaceman
voice}
Earth
calling
pilot
to
co-pilot
Look
at
the
life
on
this
planet
sir
no
sign
of
it
All
I
can
see
is
a
bunch
of
smoke
flyin
And
Im
so
high
that
I
might
die
if
I
go
by
it
Let
me
out
of
this
place
Im
outta
place
Im
in
outer
space
Ive
just
vanished
without
a
trace
Im
going
to
a
pretty
place
now
where
the
flowers
grow
Ill
be
back
in
an
hour
or
so
Cause
every
time
I

try
to
leave
Whoa-ohh
Somethin

on
my
sleeve
Whoa-ohh

say
Whoa-ohh

got
a
hold
of
me
Whoa-ohh
In
third
grade
all
I
used
to
do
was
sniff
glue
through
a
tube
and
play
Rubix
Cube
Seventeen
years
later
Im
as
Rude
as
Jude
Schemin
on
the
first
chick
with
the
hugest
boobs
Ive
got
no
game
and
every
face
looks
the
same
Theyve
got
no
name
so
I
dont
need
game
to
play
I
just
say
whatever
I
want
to
whoever
I
want
Whenever
I
want
wherever
I
want
however
I
want
However
I
do
show
some
respect
to
few
This
ecstacys
got
me
standin
next
to
you
Getting
sentimental
as

spillin
guts
to
you
We

met
but
I
think
Im
in
love
with
you
But
youre
on
it
too
so

Wake

mornin
like
Yo

go
bitch
you

I
have
stuff
to
do
Cause
if
I
get
caught
cheatin
then
Im
stuck
with

But
in
the
long
run
These
drugs
are
probably
going
to
catch
up
sooner
or
later
But
fuck
it
Im
on
one
So
lets
enjoy
let
the
X
destroy
your
spinal
cord
So
its
not
a
straight
line
no
more
Til
we
walk
around
looking
like
some
wind-up
dolls
Shits
stickin
out
of
our
backs
like
a
dinosaur
Shit
six
hits
wont
even
get
me
high
no
more
So
bye
for
now
Im
goin
to
try
to
find
some
more
Cause
every
time
I
go
to
try
to
leave
Whoa-ohh
Somethin
keeps
pullin
on
my
sleeve
Whoa-ohh
I
dont
wanna
but
I
gotta
stay
Whoa-ohh
These
drugs
really
got
ahold
of
me
Whoa-ohh
Cause
every
time
I
try
to
tell
them
No
No-ohh
They

Go-ohh
Ima
sucka
all
I
gotta
say
Whoa-ohh
is
drugs
really
got
a
hold
of
me
Whoa-ohh
Thats
the
sound
of
a
bottle
when
its
hollow
When
you
swallow
it
all
wollow
and
drown
in
your
sorrow
And
tomorrow
youre
probably
gonna
want
to
do
it
again
Whats
a
little
spinal
fluid
between
you
and
a
friend
Screw
it
And
whats
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
poisoning
And
whats
a
little
fight
Tomorrow
youll
be
boys
again
Its
your
life
live
it
however
you
wanna
Mari-ju-uana
is
everywhere
where
was
you
brought
up
It
dont
matter
as
long
as
you
get
where
youre
goin
Cause
none
of
this
shit
is
gonna
mean
shit
where
were
goin
They
tell
you
to
stop
but
you
just
sit
there
ignorin
Even
though
you
wake
up
feelin
like
shit
every
mornin
But
youre
young
youve
got
a
lot
of
drugs
to
do
Girls
to
screw
parties
to
crash
sucks
to
be
you
If
I
could
take
it
all
back
now
I
wouldnt
I
would
have
did
more
shit
that
people
said
that
I
shouldnt
But
Im
all
grown
up
now
and
upgraded
and
graduated
to
better
drugs
and
updated
But
I
still
got
a
lot
of
growin
up
to
do
I
still
got
a
whole
lot
of
throwin
up
to
spew
But
when
its
all
said
and
done
Ill
be
40
before
I
know
it
with
a
40
on
the
porch
tellin
stories

a
bottle

my
lap

Hi
there
little
boys
and
girls
FUCK
YOU
Today
were
gonna
to
learn
how
to
poison
squirrels
But
first
Id
like
you
to
meet
my
friend
Bob
Huh
Say
hi
Bob
Hi
Bob
Bobs
30
and
still
lives
with
his
mom
and
he
dont
got
a
job
cause
Bob
sits
at
home
and
smokes
pot
but
his
twelve-year
old
brother
looks
up
to
him
an
awful
lot
And
Bob
likes
to
hang
out
at
the
local
waffle
spot
and
wait
in
the
parkin
lot
for
waitresses
off
the
clock
when
its
late
and
the
lot
gets
dark
and
fake
like
he
walks
his
dog
Drag
em
in
the
woods
and
go
straight
to
the
chopping
blocks
AHH
And
even
if
they
escaped
and
they
got
the
cops
the
ladies
would
all
be
so
afraid
they
would
drop
the
charge
til
one
night
Mrs
Stacey
went
off
the
job
when
she
felt
someone
grab
her
whole
face
and
said
not
to
talk
But
Stacey
knew
it
was
Bob
and
said
knock
it
off
But
Bob
wouldnt
knock
it
off
cause
hes
crazy
and
off
his
rocker
Crazier
than
Slim
Shady
is
off
the
vodka
You
couldnt
even
take
him
to
Dres
to
get
Bob
a
Dr
He
grabbed
Stace
by
the
legs
as
chopped
it
off
her
and
dropped
her
off
in
the
lake
for
the
cops
to
find
her
But
ever
since
the
day
Stacey
went
off
to
wander
they
never
found
her
and
Bob
still
hangs
at
the
waffle
diner
And
thats
the
story
of
Bob
and
his
marijuana
and
what
it
might
do
to
you
So
see
if
the
squirrels
want
any

Ecstasy

Meet
Zach
twenty-one
years
old
After
hangin
out
with
some
friends
at
a
frat
party
he
gets
bold
and
decides
to
try
five
when
hes
bribed
by
five
guys
and
peer
pressure
will
win
every
time
you
try
to
fight
it
Suddenly
he
starts
to
convulse
and
his
pulse
goes
into
hyperdrive
and
his
eyes
roll
back
in
his
skull
{blblblblblb}
His
back
starts
tah
-
look
like
the
McDonalds
Arches
Hes
on
Donalds
carpet
layin
horizontal
barfin
{BLEH}
And
everyone
in
the
apartment
starts
laughin
at
him
Hey
Adam
Zach
is
a
jackass
look
at
him
cause
they
took
it
too
so
they
think
its
funny
So
theyre
laughing
at
basically
nothing
except
maybe
wasting
his
money
Meanwhile
Zachs
in
a
coma
the
action
is
over
and
his
back
and
his
shoulders
hunched
up
like
hes
practicin
yoga
And
thats
the
story
of
Zach
the
ecstasy
maniac
So
dont
even
feed
that
to
squirrels
class
cause
its

for
you

[Eminem]
And
last
but
not
least
one
of
the
most
humungous
problems
among
young
people
today
is
fungus
It
grows
from
cow
manure
they
pick
it
out
wipe
it
off
bag
it
up
and
you
put
it
right
in
your
mouth
and
chew
it
Yum
yum
Then
you
start
to
see
some
dumb
stuff
And
everything
slows
down
when
you
eat
some
of
em
And
sometimes
you
see
things
that
arent
there
Like
what
Like
fat
woman
in
G-strings
with
orange
hair
Mr
Shady
whats
a
G-string
Its
yarn
Claire
Women
stick
em
up
their
behinds
go
out
and
wear
em
Huh
And
if
you
swallow
too
much
of
the
magic
mushrooms
Whoops
did
I
say
magic
mushrooms
I
meant
fungus
Ya
tongue
gets
all
swoll
up
like
a
cows
tongue
How
come
cause
it
comes
from
a
cows
dung
Gross
See
drugs
are
bad
its
a
common
fact
But
your
mom
and
dad
know
thats
all
that
Im
good
at
Oh
But
dont
be
me
cause
if
you
grow
up
and
you
go
and
OD
Theyre
gonna
come
for
me
and
Ima
have
to
grow
a
goatee
and
get
a
disguise
and

So

#1
I
never
woulda
dreamed
in
a
million
years
id
see
so
many
mutha
fuckin
people
who
feel
like
me
Who
share
the
same
views
And
the
same
exact
beliefs
Its
like
a
fuckin
army
marchin
in
back
of
me
So
many
lives
i
touched
So
much
anger
aimed
at
no
perticular
direction
Just
sprays
and
sprays
Straight
through
your
radio
wavs
It
plays
and
plays
Till
it
stays
stuck
in
your
head
For
days
and
days
who
woulda
thought
standin
in
this
mirror
Bleachin
my
hair
wit
some
Peroxide
Reachin
for
a
T
shirt
to
wear
That
i
would
catipult
to
the
fore-front
of
rap
like
this
How
can
i
predict
my
words
And
have
an
impact
like
this
I
musta
struck
a
chord
wit
somebody
up
in
the
office
Cuz
congress
keeps
tellin
me
I
aint
causin
nuttin
but
problems
And
now
they
sayin
im
in
trouble
wit
the
government
Im
lovin
it
I
shovelled
shit
all
my
life
And
now
im
dumpin
it
on

Gimme

Show

When

No

No

Almost
gave
up
i
was
like
Fuck

Until
i
met
Dre
The
only
one
who
looked
past
Gave
me
a
chance
And
i
lit
a
fire
up
under
his
ass
Helped
him
get
back
to
the
top
Every
fan
black
that
i
got
Was
probly
his
In
exchange
for
every
white
fan
that
hes
got
Like
damn
we

swapped
Sittin
back

shit
wow

Does

Verse

See

These

Till

created
so

mutha
fuckin
turbulence
Straight
out

right
into
ya
livin
rooms
i
came
And
kids
Flipped
When
they
found
out
i
was
produced
by
Dre
Thats
all
it
took
And
they
were
instantly
hooked
right
in
And
they
connected
wit
me
too
cuz
i
looked
like
them
Thats
why
they
put
my
lyrics
up
under
this
microscope
Searchin
wit
a
fine
toothed
comb
Its
like
this
rope
waitin
to
choke
Tightenin
around
my
throat
Watchin
me
while
i
write
this
like
I
dont
like

All

Lyrics

To

Surely
hip
hop

In

In
Boston
After

I

so
before

thrown
me
inside
my
coffin
and
close
it
ima
expose
it
ill
take
you
back
to
73
before
I
ever
had
a
multi-platinum
sellin
Cd
I
was
a
baby
maybe
I
was
just
a
couple
of
months
my
faggot
father
must
have
had
his
panties
up
in
a
bunch
cause
he
split
I
wonder
if
he
even
kissed
me
goodbye
no
I
dont
on
second
thought
I
just
fuckin
wished
he
would
die
I
look
at
Hailie
and
I
couldnt
picture
leavin
her
side
even
if
I
hated
Kim
I
grit
my
teeth
and
Id
try
to
make
it
work
with
her
at
least
for
Hailies
sake
I
maybe
made
some
mistakes
but
im
only
human
but
im
man
enough
to
face
them
today
what
I
did
was
stupid
no
doubt
it
was
dumb
but
the
smartest
shit
I
did
was
take
them
bullets
out
of
that
gun
cause
ida
killed
em
shit
I
would
have
shot
Kim
and
him
both
its
my
life
id
like
to
welcome
yall
to
the
Eminem
show
[CHORUS]
Now
I
would
never
diss
my
own
mama
just
to
get
recognition
take
a
second
to
listen
who
you
think
this
record
is
dissin
but
put
yourself
in
my
position
just
try
to
envision
witnessin
your
Mama
poppin
prescription
pills
in
the
kitchen
bitchin
that
someones
always
goin
through
her
purse
and
shits
missin
going
through
public
housing
systems
victim
of
Munchausens
syndrome
my
whole
life
I
was
made
to
believe
I
was
sick
when
I
wasnt

I
grew
up
now
I
blew
up
it
makes
you
sick
to
ya
stomach
doesnt
it
wasnt
it
the
reason
you
made
that
Cd
for
me
ma
so
you
could
try
to
justify
the
way
you
treated
me
ma

cold
when

appealin
willin
to

if

said
when

people
just
want
to
see
if
its
true
if
its
you
what
you
say
in
your
raps
what
you
do
so
they
feel
as

of
your
obligation
to
fulfill
when
they
see
you
on
the
streets
face
to

are
you
for
real
in
confrontation
aint

the
sound

the
sound
of
Kim
as
she
licks
on
a
cock
listen
to
the
sound
of
me
spillin
my
heart
through
this
pen
motherfuckers

that
ill
never

Marshall
again
full
of
controversy
until

I
thought
I
had
it
all
figured
out
I
did
I
thought
I
was
tough
enough
to
stick
it
out
with
Kim
But
I
wasnt
tough
enough
to
juggle
two
things
at
once
I
found
myself
layin
on
my
knees
in
cuffs
Which
shouldve
been
a
reason
enough
for
me
to
get
my
stuff
and
just
leave
How
come
I
couldnt
see
this
shit
myself
its
just
me
Nobody
couldnt
see
the
shit
I
felt
Knowin
damn
well
she
wasnt
gonna
be
there
when
I
fell
to
catch
me
The
minute
shit
was
heated
she
just
bailed
im
standin
here
swingin
on
like
thirty
people
by
myself
I
couldnt
even
see
the
millimetere
when
it
fell
Turned
around
saw
Gary
stashin
the
heater
in
his
belt
Saw
the
bouncers
rush
him
and
beat
him
to
the
ground
I
just
sold
two
million
records
I
dont
need
to
go
to
jail
Im
not
about
to
lose
my
freedom
over
no
female
I
need
to
slow
down
Try
to
get
my
feet
on
solid
ground
so
for
now
im
[CHORUS]
[Verse
2]
Bury
my
face
in
comic
books
cause
I
dont
want
to
look
At
nothin
this
worlds
too
much
Ive
swallowed
all
I
could
If
I
could
swallow
a
bottle
of
tylenol
I
would
and
end
it
for
good
Just
say
goodbye
to
Hollywood
I
probably
should
these
problems
are
piling
all
at
once
Cause
everything
that
bothers
me
I
got
it
bottled
up
I
think
im
bottomin
out
But
im
not
about
to
give
up
I
gotta
get
up
Thank
God
I
got
a
little
girl
And
Im
a
responsible
father
So
not
a
lot
of
good
id
be
to
my
daughter
layin
in
the
bottom
of
the
mud
Must
be
in
my
blood
cause
I
dont
know
how
I
do
it
All
I
know
is
I
dont
want
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
my
dad
Cause
I
hate
him
so
bad
The
worst
fear
that
I
had
was
growin
up
to
be
like
his
fuckin
ass
man
If
you
could
understand
why
I
am
the
way
that
I
am
What
do
I
say
to
my
fans
when
I
tell
em
im
[CHORUS]
[Verse
3]
I
dont
wanna
quit
but
shit
I
feel
like
this
is
it
For
me
to
have
this
much
appeal
like
this
is
sick
This
is
not
a
game
this
fame
in
real
life
this
is
sick
Publicity
stunt
my
ass
conceal
my
fuckin
dick
Fuck
the
guns
im
done
ill
never
look
at
gats
If
I
scrap
ill
scrap
like
I
aint
never
whooped
some
ass
I
love
my
fans
But
no
one
ever
puts
a
grasp
on
the
fact
ive
sacrificed
everything
I
have
I
never
dreamt
id
get
to
the
level
that
im
at
this
is
whack
This
is
more
than
I
ever
could
of
asked
everywhere
I
go
a
hat
a
sweater
hood
or
mask
What
about
math
how
come
I
wasnt
ever
good
at
that
Its
like
the
boy
in
the
bubble
who
never
could
adapt
im
trapped
If
I
could
go
back
I
never
woulda
rapped
I
sold
my
soul
to
the
devil
ill
never
get
it
back
I
just
wanna
leave
this
game
with
level
head
intact
Imagine
goin
from
bein
a
no
one
to
seein
everything
blow
up
and
all
you
did
was
just
grow
up
emceeing
Its
fuckin
crazy
Cause
all
I
wanted
was
to
give
Hailie
the
life
I
never
had
But
instead
I
forced
us
to
live
alienated
so
im
sayin
[CHORUS]
[Outro]
Goodbye

{Goodbye}

dont
cry
for
me
when

So

‘Cause

empty
without

Little
hellions
kids
feeling
rebellious
Embarrassed
their
parents
still
listen
to
Elvis
They
start
feeling
like
prisoners
helpless
Til
someone
comes
along
on
a
mission
and
yells
Bitch
A
visionary
vision
is
scary
Could
start
a
revolution
polluting
the
airwaves
A
rebel
so
just
let
me
revel
and
bask
In
the
fact
that
I
got
everyone
kissing
my
ass
{​​smack}​​
And
its
a
disaster
such
a
catastrophe
For
you
to
see
so
damn
much
of
my
ass—you
asked
for
me
Well

Fix

bent
antenna

in
and
then
Im
gonna
Enter
in
and
up
under
your
skin
like
a
splinter
The
center
of
attention
back
for
the
winter
Im
interesting
the
best
thing
since
wrestling
Infesting
in
your
kids
ears
and
nesting
Testing
attention
please
Feel
the
tension
soon
as
someone
mentions
me
Heres
my
ten
cents
my
two
cents
is
free
A
nuisance

You

for
me
Now
this
looks
like
a
job
for
me

Ever

Everybody

So

mean
Im
disgusting
But

just
me
Im

obscene
No

I

worst
thing
since
Elvis
Presley
To
do
black
music
so
selfishly
And
use
it
to
get
myself
wealthy
Heyyy
Theres
a
concept
that

white
rappers

so
empty
without

we

Kids
These
ideas
are
nightmares
to
white
parents
Whose
worst
fear
is
a
child
with
dyed
hair
and
who
likes
earrings
Like
whatever
they
say
has
no
bearing
Its
so
scary
in
a
house
that
allows
no
swearing
To
see
him
walking
around
with
his
headphones
blaring
Alone
in
his
own
zone
cold
and
he
dont
care
Hes
a
problem
child
and
what
bothers
him
all
comes
out
When
he
talks
about
his
fucking
dad
walking
out
Cause
he
hates
him
so
bad
that
he
blocks
him
out
If
he
ever
saw
him
again
hed
probably
knock
him
out
His
thoughts
are
wacked
hes
mad
so
hes
talking
back
Talking
black
brainwashed
from
rock
and
rap
He
sags
his
pants
doo-rags
and
a
stocking
cap
His
step-father
hit
him
so
he
socked
him
back
And
broke
his
nose
his
house
is
a
broken
home
Theres
no
control
he
just
lets
his
emotions
go
Sing
with
me
sing
for
the
year
sing
it
Sing
for
the
laughter
sing
for
the
tear
Come
on
Sing
it
with
me
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
Entertainment
is
changing
intertwining
with
gangsters
In
the
land
of
the
killers
a
sinners
mind
is
a
sanctum
Holy
or
unholy
only
have
one
homie
Only
this
gun
lonely
cause
dont
anyone
know
me
Yet
everybody
just
feels
like
they
can
relate
I
guess
words
are
a
mothafucka
they
can
be
great
Or
they
can
degrade
or
even
worse
they
can
teach
hate
Its
like
these
kids
hang
on
every
single
statement
we
make
Like
they
worship
us
plus
all
the
stores
ship
us
platinum
Now
how
the
fuck
did
this
metamorphosis
happen
From
standing
on
corners
and
porches
just
rapping
To
having
a
fortune
no
more
kissing
ass
But
then
these
critics
crucify
you
journalists
try
to
burn
you
Fans
turn
on
you
attorneys
all
want
a
turn
at
you
To
get
they
hands
on
every
dime
you
have
They
want
you
to
lose
your
mind
every
time
you
mad
So
they
can
try
to
make
you
out
to
look
like
a
loose
cannon
Any
dispute
wont
hesitate
to
produce
handguns
Thats
why
these
prosecutors
wanna
convict
me
Strictly
just
to
get
me
off
of
these
streets
quickly
But
all
their
kids
been
listening
to
me
religiously
So
Im
signing
CDs
while
police
fingerprint
me
Theyre
for
the
judges
daughter
but
his
grudge
is
against
me
If
Im
such
a
fucking
menace
this
shit
doesnt
make
sense
B
Its
all
political
if
my
music
is
literal
Then
Im
a
criminal
how
the
fuck
can
I
raise
a
little
girl
I
couldnt
I
wouldnt
be
fit
to
Youre
full
of
shit
too
Guerrera
that
was
a
fist
that
hit
you
Sing
with
me
sing
for
the
year
sing
it
Sing
for
the
laughter
sing
for
the
tear
sing
this
shit
Sing
it
with
me
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
They
say
music
can
alter
moods
and
talk
to
you
Well
can
it
load
a
gun
up
for
you
and
cock
it
too
Well
if
it
can
and
the
next
time
you
assault
a
dude
Just
tell
the
judge
it
was
my
fault
and
Ill
get
sued
See
what
these
kids
do
is
hear
bout
us
toting
pistols
And
they
wanna
get
one
cause
they
think
the
shits
cool
Not
knowing
we
really
just
protecting
ourselves
We
entertainers
of
course
the
shits
affecting
our
sales
You
ignoramus
but
music
is
reflection
of
self
We
just
explain
it
and
then
we
get
our
checks
in
the
mail
Its
fucked
up
aint
it
How
we
can
come
from
practically
nothing
To
being
able
to
have
any
fucking
thing
that
we
wanted
Thats
why
we
sing
for
these
kids
who
dont
have
a
thing
Except
for
a
dream
and
a
fucking
rap
magazine
Who
post
pin-up
pictures
on
they
walls
all
day
long
Idolize
their
favorite
rappers
and
know
all
their
songs
Or
for
anyone
whos
ever
been
through
shit
in
they
lives
So
they
sit
and
they
cry
at
night
wishing
theyd
die
til
they
throw
on
a
rap
record
and
they
sit
and
they
vibe
Were
nothing
to
you
but
were
the
fucking
shit
in
their
eyes
Thats
why
we
seize
the
moment
try
to
freeze
it
and
own
it
Squeeze
it
and
hold
it
cause
we
consider
these
minutes
golden
And
maybe
theyll
admit
it
when
were
gone
Just
let
our
spirits
live
on
Through
our
lyrics
that
you
hear
in
our
songs
and
we
can
Sing
with
me
sing
for
the
year
sing
it
Sing
for
the
laughter
sing
for
the
tear
Come
on
Sing
it
with
me
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
Sing

me

Yeah
Im

I
got
my
baby
back
Yo
check
it
out
Some
days
I
sit
starin
out
the
window
Watchin
this
world
pass
me
by
Sometimes
I
think
theres
nothin
to
live
for
I
almost
break
down
and
cry
Sometimes
I
think
Im
crazy
Im
crazy
Oh
so
crazy
Why
am
I
here
Am
I
just
wastin
my
time
But
then
I
see
my
baby
Suddenly
Im
not
crazy
It
all
makes
sense
when
I
look
into
her
eyes
oh
no
Cause
sometimes
it
feels
Like
the
worlds
on
my
shoulders
Everyones
leanin
on
me
Cause
sometimes
it
feels
Like
the
worlds
almost
over
But
then
she
comes
back
to
me
My
baby
girl
keeps
gettin
older
I
watch
her
grow
up
with
pride
People
make
jokes
cause
they
dont
understand
me
They
just
dont
see
my
real
side
I
act
like
shit
dont
faze
me
Inside
it
drives
me
crazy
My
insecurities
could
eat
me
alive
But
then
I
see
my
baby
Suddenly
Im
not
crazy
It
all
makes
sense
when
I
look
into
her
eyes
oh
no
Cause
sometimes
it
feels
Like
the
worlds
on
my
shoulders
Everyones
leanin
on
me
Cause
sometimes
it
feels
Like
the
worlds
almost
over
But
then
she
comes
back
to
me
Man
if
I
could
sing
Id
keep
singin
this
song
to
my
daughter
If
I
could
hit
the
notes
Id
blow
somethin
as
long
as
my
father
To
show
her
how
I
feel
about
her
how
proud
I
am
that
I
got
her
God
Im
a
daddy
Im
so
glad
that
her
mom
didnt
want
her
Now
you
probably
get
this
picture
from
my
public
persona
That
Im
a
pistol-packin
drug
addict
who
bags
on
his
mama
But
I
wanna
just
take
this
time
out
to
be
perfectly
honest
Cause
theres
a
lot
of
shit
I
keep
bottled
That
hurts
deep
inside
of
my
soul
And
just
know
that
I
grow
colder
the
older
I
grow
This
boulder
on
my
shoulder
gets
heavy
and
harder
to
hold
And
this
load
is
like
the
weight
of
the
world
And
I
think
my
neck
is
breakin
Should
I
just
give
up
or
try
to
live
up
to
these
expectations
Now
look
I
love
my
daughter
more
than
life
in
itself
But
I
got
a
wife
thats
determined
to
make
my
life
livin
hell
But
I
handle
it
well
given
the
circumstances
Im
dealt
So
many
chances
man
its
too
bad
coulda
had
someone
else
But
the
years
that
Ive
wasted
Is
nothin
to
the
tears
that
Ive
tasted
So
heres
what
Im
facin:
three
felonies
six
years
of
probation
Ive
went
to
jail
for
this
woman
Ive
been
to
bat
for
this
woman
Ive
taken
bats
to
peoples
backs
Bent
over
backwards
for
this
woman
Man
I
shoulda
seen
it
comin
whatd
I
stick
my
penis
up
in
Wouldnt
have
ripped
the
prenup
up
If
Id
have
seen
what
she
was
fuckin
but
fuck
it
Its
over
theres
no
more
reason
to
cry
no
more
I
got
my
baby
baby
the
only
lady
that
I
adore
Hailie
So
sayonara
try
tomorrow
nice
to
know
ya
Our
babys
traveled
back
to
the
arms
of
her
rightful
owner
And
suddenly
it
seems
like
my
shoulder
blades
have
just
shifted
Its
like
the
greatest
gift
you
can
get
the
weight
has
been
lifted
And
now
it
dont
feel
like
the
worlds
on
my
shoulders
Everyones
leanin
on
me
Cause
my
baby
knows
that
her
daddys
a
soldier
Nothin
can
take
her
from
me
Wooo

I
was
happy
having
a
deal
at
first
Thought
money
would
make
me
happy
but
It
only
made
my
pain
worst
It
hurts
when

see
ur
friends

their
back
on

dawg
When
u
aint
got
nothing
left
but
ur
word
and
ur

And
youre
stressed
from
the
calls
of
your
new
friends
Beggin

Checking

When

Out

About

in
a
pool
of

If

Be

Live

Eyes

[Eminem]
Ha

old
lady
Cuz
what

what
you
say
Sometimes
what
you
mean
is
2
different
things
Depending
on
your
mood
if
it
swings
think
too
many
things
Little
hit
of
Dres
weed
I
can
do
anything
Catch
a
contact
then
Im
gone
and
Im
back
I
speed
write
and
my
loose
leaves
my
lanch
pad
[Dr
Dre]
And
I
can
pull
any
string
Dont
have
to
prove
anything
Catch
a
contract
on
your
head
You
headed
West
talk
shit
about
Dre
You
better
get
a
vest
then
invest
in
something
To
protect
your
head
and
neck
[Eminem]
And
its
back
and
forth
all
day
like
Red
and
Meth
I
joke
when
I
say
Im
the
best
in
the
booth
But
a
lot
of
truth
is
said
injest
And
if
I
ever
do
live
to
be
a
legend
Ima
die
a
sudden
death
5
mics
in
The
Source
Aint
holdin
my
fuckin
breath
But
I
suffocate
for
the
respect
Fore
I

the
collect
the

check
[Chorus:]
Cuz

Watch

fuckin

Yo

Timbaland

I
said
suck
[tchka]
my
dick
Cause
sometimes
you
just
feel
tired
feel
weak
And
when
you
feel
weak
you
feel
like
you
wanna
just
give
up
But
you
gotta
search
within
you
and
gotta
find
that
inner
strength
and
just
pull
that
shit
out
of
you
And
get
that
motivation
to
not
give
up
And
not
be
a
quitter
no
matter
how
bad
you
wanna
just
fall
flat
on
your
face
and
collapse
Till
I
collapse
Im
spilling
these
raps
long
as
you
feel
em
Till
the
day
that
I
drop
youll
never
say
that
Im
not
killing
em
Cause
when
I
am
not
then
Imma
stop
penning
em
And
I
am
not
hip
hop
and
Im
just
not
Eminem
Subliminal
thoughts
when
Ima
stop
sending
em
Women

caught
in

spin

and
hock

Adrenaline
shots
of
penicillin
could
not
get
the
illin
to

Amoxicillins
just
not
real
enough
The

killin

A
minimal
swap
to

millions
of
Pac
listeners
Youre
coming
with
me
feel
it
or
not
youre
gonna
fear
it
Like
I
showed
you
the
spirit
of
God
lives
in
us
You
hear
it
a
lot
lyrics
to
shock
Is
it
a
miracle
or
am
I
just
product
of
pop
fizzin
up
Fa
shizzel
my
wizzel
this
is
the
plot
listen
up
You
bizzels
forgot
Slizzel
does
not
give
a
fuck
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Music
is
like
magic
theres
a
certain
feeling
you
get
When
you
real
and
you
spit
and
people
are
feeling
your
shit
This
is
your
moment
and
every
single
minute
you
spend
Tryna
hold
on
to
it
because
you
may
never
get
it
again
So
while
youre
in
it
try
to
get
as
much
shit
as
you
can
And
when
your
run
is
over
just
admit
when
its
at
its
end
Because
Im
at
the
end
of
my
wits
with
half
the
shit
that
gets
in
I
got
a
list
heres
the
order
of
my
list
that
its
in
It
goes
Reggie
Jay-Z
2Pac
and
Biggie
Andre
from
OutKast
Jada
Kurupt
Nas
and
then
me
But
in
this
industry
Im
the
cause
of
a
lot
of
envy
So
when
Im
not
put
on
this
list
the
shit
does
not
offend
me
Thats
why
you
see
me
walk
around
like
nothings
bothering
me
Even
though
half
you
people
got
a
fuckin
problem
with
me
You
hate
it
but
you
know
respect
you
got
to
give
me
The
presss
wet
dream
like
Bobby
and
Whitney
Nate
hit
me
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Soon
as
a
verse
starts
I
eat
at
an
emcees
heart
What
is
he
thinking
How
not
to
go
against
me
smart
And
its
absurd
how
people
hang
on
every
word
Ill
probably
never
get
the
props
I
feel
I
ever
deserve
But
Ill
never
be
served
my
spot
is
forever
reserved
If
I
ever
leave
Earth
that
would
be
the
death
of
me
first
Cause
in
my
heart
of
hearts
I
know
nothing
could
ever
be
worse
Thats
why
Im
clever
when
I
put
together
every
verse
My
thoughts
are
sporadic
I
act
like
Im
an
addict
I
rap
like
Im
addicted
to
smack
like
Im
Kim
Mathers
But
I
dont
want
to
go
forth
and
back
in
constant
battles
The
fact
is
I
would
rather
sit
back
and
bomb
some
rappers
So
this
is
like
a
full-blown
attack
Im
launching
at
em
The
track
is
on
some
battling
raps
who
want
some
static
Cause
I
dont
really
think
that
the
fact
that
Im
Slim
matters
A
plaque
and
platinum
status
is
whack
if
Im
not
the
baddest
So
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Until
the
roof
until
the
roof
The
roof
comes
off
the
roof
comes
off
Until
my
legs
until
my
legs
Give
out
from
underneath
me
I
will
not
fall
I
will
stand
tall
Feels
like
no
one
can
beat
me

motherfuckin
cocks

record
Id

a
pussy-whipped
bitch
Eat

lips
glued
to

face
with
a
clit
Ring

my

MO
I

Catch

homo
by
his

man
I
dont

Am
I
the
only
fuckin
one
whos
normal
any
more
Dad
Theres
really
nothin
else

I
cant
explain

I
think
my

A
little
help
from
Hailie
Jade
Wont

I
think
my

Theres

That

I

Theres

Not

Hailie
I
think
my
dads
gone
crazy
My
songs
can
make
you
cry
take
you
by
surprise
At
the
same
time
can
make
you
dry
your
eyes
With
the
same
rhyme
See
what
youre
seein
is
a
genius
at
work
Which
to
me
isnt
work
So
its
easy
to
misinterpret
it
at
first
Cause
when
I
speak
its
tongue-in-cheek
Id
yank
my
fuckin
teeth
Before
Id
ever
bite
my
tongue
Id
slice
my
gums
Get
struck
by
fuckin
lightning
twice
at
once
And
die
and
come
back
as
Vanilla
Ices
son
And
walk
around
the
rest
of
my
life
spit
on
And
kicked
and
hit
with
shit
every
time
I
sung
Like
R
Kelly
as
soon
as
Bump
and
Grind
comes
on
More
pain
inside
of
my
brain
Than
the
eyes
of
a
little
girl
inside
of
a
plane
Aimed
at
the
World
Trade
Standin
on
Ronnies
grave
screamin
at
the
sky
Til
clouds
gather
its
Clyde
Mathers
and
Bonnie
Jade
And
thats
pretty
much
the
gist
of
it
The
parents
are
pissed
but
the
kids
love
it
9
millimeter
heaters
stashed
In
two-seaters
with
meat
cleavers
I
dont
blame
you
I
wouldnt
let
Hailie
listen
to
me
neither
Theres
really
nothin
else
to
say
I
cant
explain
it
I
think
my
dads
gone
crazy
A
little
help
from
Hailie
Jade
Wont
you
tell

I

Theres

That

I

Theres
no

Not

Hailie
I

Crazy
Ha

Can

Wanna

[Chorus]
Im
only
entertaining
you
why
Going
to
stimulate
making
you
high
And
take
you
and
I
to
a
place
that
you
cant
see
But
I
believe
you
can
fly
I
dont
need
nobody
home
Im
just
partying
Im
not
your
dad
not
your
mom
not
your
guardian
Just
a
man
whos
on
the
mic
so
let
me
entertain
you
[Verse
1]
My
lyrical
content
is
constantly
undefined
No
wonder
why
I
constantly
bomb
back
To
come
back
attacks
with
constant
concepts
From
lyrics
constantly
took
out
of
context
Failure
to
communicate
with
congresses
Been
a
problem
for
the
longest
I
guess
but
Maybe
one
day
we
can
make
some
progress
Food
for
thought
see
how
long
it
takes
to
digest
Feeling
good
when
I
should
be
ashamed
Shit
I
really
shouldve
fell
when
I
stood
See
I
came
like
a
flame
in
the
night
Like
a
ghost
in
the
dark
theres
a
ray
theres
a
light
Theres
a
hope
theres
a
spark
But
when
planets
collide
theyll
never
see
eye
to
eye
Until
they
decide
to
set
the
differences
aside
And
this
is
why
only
one
of
us
will
survive
So
children
follow
my
lead
and
feel
the
vibe
because
[Chorus
x1]
[Verse
2]
My
music
can
be
slightly
amusing
You
shouldnt
take
lyrics
so
serious
It
might
be
confusing
Trying
to
seperate
the
truth
from
entertainment
Its
stupid
aint
it
I
get
sick
of
trying
to
explain
it
See
I
can
sit
and
argue
with
you
but
it
goes
beyond
Just
being
a
snot
pointy
nosed
bleached
blonde
Cuz
I
came
here
to
uplift
let
your
woes
be
gone
Tell
em
to
get
fucked
and
just
mosey
on
Constantly
movin
constantly
using
the
constitution
As
a
form
of
restitution
Bless
the
children
nothing
less
than
brilliant
Let
me
entertain
you
like
Robbie
Williams
Ill
be
here
when
yall
are
gone
re-building
Were
all
revolving
still
evolving
still
Slim
How
many
kids
will
cop
me
Probably
millions
But
Ima
do
this
as
a
fuckin
hobby
till
then
[Chorus
X1]
[Verse
3]
My
lyrical
content
contains
subject
matter
That
sucks
up
all
these
fucked
up
young
kids
Out
of
a
long
and
great
common
denominate
Add
it
up
and
youll
see
thats
why
I
dominate
I
try
to
stimulate
but
kids
imulate
And
mimmick
ever
move
you
make
Slim
youre
great
But
wait
cant
you
see
im
only
here
to
entertain
I
gotta
be
the
one
to
go
against
the
grain
Cuz
man
I
see
it
feel
it
live
it
But
its
inhumane
for
me
to
see
you
be
influenced
And
pretend
you
aint
But
they
dont
understand
that
ive
been
through
pain
If
you
get
to
know
me
I
can
be
a
friend
you
gain
But
you
cant
just
stand
there
and
try
to
touch
It
hurts
but
your
jealousy
probably
tears
you
up
inside
as
much
And
its
such
a
pleasure
every
button
that
I
touch
I
treasure
every
glutton
that
I
punish
in
my
lust
But
im
[Chorus

So

Monkey

Tweedle-de-tweedle-dum
If
they

Now

they
come
as
we

now
we
just
set

Check-mate
motherfucker
Games
over
We
won
Tweedle-de-tweedle-dum
It
doesnt
take
much
For
me
to
raise
such
a
stink
up
When
motherfuckers
hate
your
guts
You
aint
even
gotta
say
much
For
me
to
put
a
pen
to
a
blank
sheet
of
papers
Like
smearing
blood
stains
with
a
paint
brush
I
cant
explain
what
it
is
my
brain
does
But
however
it
works
its
insane
Its
plain
nutz
And
it
aint
just
my
brain
thas
dangerous
Its
a
whole
combination
of
things
It
takes
nutz
And
im
not
affriad
to
raise
the
stakes
up
I
got
a
million
bucks
in
the
banks
and
8
trucks
For
anybody
who
gets
on
the
track
and
spanks
us
Im
patiently
waiting
for
the
day
Im
anxious
To
see
the
look
on
ya
fake
mugs
When
you
thugs
go
bankrupt
Ya
drunk
Ya
aint
tough
Whatever
you
drank
musta
just
turned
ya
into
some
gangstas
This
is
me
talking
motherfucker
This
aint
drugs
You
wanna
pop
shit
wake-up
then
make-up
FUCK
THAT
Its
too
late
chump
now
face
up
I
pray
for
the
day
that
someone
who
spits
with
the
calliber
that
nas
and
jay
does
Opens
up
his
jaw
to
say
something
or
rattle
my
name
off
Or
rattle
the
first
thing
from
the
top
of
his
brain
off
So
i
can
blow
the
fuckin
dust
off
of
this
chainsaw
And
give
him
the
surgery
that
he
came
for
Till
i
pull
the
paint
off
I
never
been
shot
But
i
think
me
and
50
musta
been
cut
from
the
same
cloth
Cause
ive
always
came
off
Like
jas
chain
When
they
try
to
rush
him
and
lost
And
came
back
and
gave
him
a
watch
in
exchange
for
it
I
dont
stop
The
only
thing
i
wait
for
Is
day
that
i
dont
gotta
report
to
probate
court
Cause
ima
give
ya
all
the
reason
to
hate
more
Cause
ive
been
holding
my
tounge
till
i
got
a
sprained
jaw
Alot
of
rappers
on
my
list
that
just
aint
ja
And
ima
read
that
motherfucker
off
from
april
You
pussies

mile
When

more
than
just
paint
balls
Trust

[verse

Cuz
I

Good
cuz
youre
so
fuckin
beautiful
when

angry
It
makes
me
wanna
just
take
you
and
just
throw
you
on
the
bed
and
fuck
you

I
dont

You

Youre
a
SLUT
but
im
equal
im
a
MUTT
were
both
evilin
our
ways
but
neither
one
of
us
would
ever
admit
it
Cuz
one
of
us
would
have
one
up
on
the
other
so
forget
it
We
can
make
accusations
people
spread
rumours
But
they
aint
got
proof
till
they
do
its
just
the
two
of
us
You
and
me
cuz
any
chick
can
say
that
shes
screwin
me
But
you
gotta
believe
it
to
a
degree
cuz
true
indeed
If
you
didnt
I
wouldnt
be
hittin
yeah
I
would
Cuz
the
sex
is
too
damn
good
if
I
ran
who
would
I
run
to
that
would
be
this
soft
and
warm
So
its
off
and
on
Usually
more
off
then
on
but
at
least
we
know
that
we
Share
this
common
bond
youre
the
only
one
I
can
fuck
without
a
condom
on
I
hope
the
only
reason
that
I
cope
Is
cuz
of
that
fact
and
I
can
bust
in
that
and
thats
why
[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me
I
just
love
you
more
You
dont
want
me
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers
you
throw
em
at
me
I
know
its
sad
but
its
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
[verse
3]
I
can
never
understand
it
thats
why
I
dont
try
From
junior
high
until
we
both
die
you
silly
hoe
why
must
we
try
Is
it
really
so
rough
that
we
must
always
call
each
others
Billy
Goats
Gruff
Try
to
pull
each
others
legs
until
the
other
begs
Were
lying
to
ourself
thats
the
beauty
of
it
yeah
Cuz
we
truly
love
each
other
thats
why
we
always
fight
And
all
we
do
is
shove
each
other
every
other
fuckin
night
And
its
clear
it
aint
gonna
change
this
pinned
up
rage
We
both
have
we
both
feel
like
weve
been
upstaged
By
someone
else
we
both
been
someone
elses
someone
else
The
problem
is
neither
one
wants
help
its
an
addiction
And
it
cant
be
fixed
our
familys
mixed
up
Theres
a
baby
sister
in
the
mix
and
it
hurts
cuz
the
pieces
to
the
puzzle
dont
fit
And
anybody
who
thinks
he
knows
us
doesnt
know
shit
And
theyre
probably
just
tired
of
hearing
it
all
the
time
on
every
song
Every
lyric
and
every
rhyme
all
the
hoopla
all
of
the
woopty
woo
What
you
put
me
through
fuckin
woopty
do
But
I
wont
be
made
a
fool
of
if
this
is
true
love
You
wouldnt
do
what
you
did
last
time
you
wouldnt
screw
up
This
time
cuz
this
time
girl
im
tellin
you
what
You
do
it
again
and
im
fuckin
you
up
cuz
no
matter
[chorus
2]
What
you
say
what
you
do
Ima
hunt
you
down
till
I
find
you
No
matter
where
you
run
ill
be
right
there
Right
behind
you
in
your
nightmares
So
much
for
them
flowers
and
the
candy
All
the
times
that
you
threw
it
back
at
me
Told
me
you
hate
me
you
gon
hate
me
more
When
you
find
out
you
cant
escape
me
whore
[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me
I
just
love
you
more
You
dont
want
me
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers

at
me
I
know
its
sad
but

happy
The
more
that

the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
[In

high
falsetto
voice]
Uncle
Marshall
Will

tell

a
bedtime
story
[regular
voice]
Here
we
go
Now
once
upon
a
time
not
long
ago
There
was
a
little
rapper
about
to
blow
But
his
album
came
and
it
was
not
good
I
think
it
went
lead
or
double
copper
wood
So
the
silly
little
fans
they
were
mislead
By
a
nerdy
internet
computer
hip-hop
head
Me
and
you
Clef
were
gonna
make
some
cash
Grab
the
silver
paint
and
lets
paint
my
ass
Hey
mister
would
ya
care
to
bare
witness
to
The
ass-whippin
Im
about
to
administer
To
this
ass-kissin
little
vaginal
blister
Stanabis
little
Marshall
Mathers
sister
And
in
this
corner
we
have
the
mister
Not
havin
it
its
the
mad
sinister
Dr
Evil
with
his
bag
of
tricks
for
this
little
antagonist
faggot
dick-suckin
Ex-LL
Cool
J
fan

From

Oh

Now
at
first
I
aint
really
understand
the
shit
Picture
me
for
a
second
and
imagine
it
Chillin
in
the
Bat-Mansion
and
relaxin
When
all
a
sudden
some
bullshit
comes
across
the
scanners
Its
Can-i-bitch
on
some
Stan
Lives
shit
It
creeped
me
out
at
first
Man
this
is
sick
For
me
being
just
a
sick
this
conflict
Gets
my
dick
harder
than
arithmetic
And
I
know
how
you
jealous
ones
envy
I
shoulda
knew
better
from
the
first
few
letters
you
sent
me
The
first
two
letters
you
were
tellin
me
shit
Like
you
respect
me
like
any
other
regular
MC
The
third
letter
you
ask
how
come
I
aint

None
of
the
messages
at
Shady
Records
you
left
me
The
fourth
letter:
Slim

startin
to
upset
me
The
fifth
letter
told
me
you
were
comin
to
get
me
The
sixth
letter
theres
a
bomb
threat
in
our
building
This
crazy
motherfuckers

tryin
to
kill
me
So
I
went
back
and

the
first
few
letters
that
said
Some
shit
about

Oh

York
or

From

So

two
seconds

my
crib
The
funny
thing

where
this
kid
lives
And
neither
one
of
us

Canadian
citizenship
Shit
Oh
Dre
wait

mintue

All
we
gotta
do
is
use
a
bit
of
turbo
boost
We
can
fly
over
the
border
Lets

[WOOSH]
So

off
to
Toronto
and

[BOOSH]
What

Oh

Wait

more
time
in

Okay

the
car
Oh

more
thousand
miles
Meanwhile
me
and
Dre
are
tryin
to
conversate
Just
tryin
to
find
a
reason
for
the
constant
hate
And
tryin
to
figure
out
what
happened
to
Germaine
Propaine
He
couldnt
have
fell
off
that
hard
Aint
no
way
What
happened
to
the
way
you
was
rappin
when
you
was
scandalous
That
Canibus
turned
into
a
television
evangelist
Plus
he
raps
with
his
regular
voice
[BOOSH
BOOSH]
[BOOSH
BOOSH]
What
was
that
Pet
Shop
Boys
So
we
pull
up
to
the
bridge
where
he
last
was
spotted
His
corpse
was
still
movin
but
his
ass
was
rotted
He
kinda
smelled
a
little
like
Courtney
Love
I
figure
if
I
stick
him
with
a
fork
hes
done
So
I
stabbed
him
twice
kept
jabbin
Christ
He
wont
die
this

like
a
battered
wife
Hes

Kim

more
But
he
wont
fight
back
I
cracked
his
jaw
Hold
up
Bis
quit
foldin
up
Punch

in
the
chest
Make
my
shoulders
touch
Do

At

9-9-9-
ty-nine
percent

fans

Bis

Tell

sun

and
stars
Intergalatical
metaphors
from
Mars
Raw
to
the
floor
raw
like
Reservoir
Dogs
Bite
another
line
from
Redmans
song
Suddenly
the
stub
from
a
dead
mans
arm
From
a
midget
reaches
out
from
under
the
car
Its
JD
this
motherfucker
wont
die
neither
Dre
starts
sprayin
him
with
cans
of
ether
We
stomped
the
bitch
and
then
stopmed
the
bitch

Compton
Detroit
bitch
Talk

Stomp

switch
feet
Stomp

Dre

Stanabis

Damn

[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch

Can-i-bitch
Where

Can-i-bitch
Please

what
happened
with
That
style
that
you
were
rappin
with
Can-i-bitch

Can-i-bitch
Are

from
Los
Angeles
New
York
or
just
a
janitor
From
Canada
Oh
Can-i-bitch
[Intro]
Yo
check
it
out
its
fucked
up
and
I
dont
see
either
one
of
us
budging
[Verse]
Im
withholding
my
anger
Though
Id
like
to
be
the
strangler
Of
this
punk
ass
little
pussys
puny
neck
Its
my
right
to
insist
That
he
acknowledge
my
existence
But
he
just
displays
complete
lack
of
respect
Thats
what
he
says
to
himself
As
he
uses
magazines
to
trash
me
As
he
sits
with
both
feet
up
at
his
desk
Smokes
a
bag
of
his
weed
And
starts
imagining
things
And
he
just
cant
see
that
hes
manically
depressed
And
in
his
jealousy
and
envy
It
just
whirls
him
in
a
frenzy
As
he
turns
on
MTV
and
sees
my
face
He
dont
exist
in
this
world
So
he
just
twists
and
he
twirls
Spirals
and
spins
till
he
hurls
himself
into
rage
And
its
destroying
him
slowly
Cuz
he
does
not
even
know
me
Even
though
he
sees
me
everywhere
he
goes
So
he
just
tortures
himself
He
has
no
fortune
and
wealth
So
he
extorts
someone
else
to
get
his
dough
And
now
hes
acting
like
a
bully
So
he
tries
to
push
and
pull
me
But
he
knows
that
he
cant
fool
me
so
hes
mad
He
has
no
choice
but
to
scream
And
raise
his
voice
up
at
me
Cuz
it
annoys
him
to
see
that
I
aint
scared
[Chorus]
You
aint
no
motherfucking
bully
And
I
aint
bowing
to
no
motherfucking
bully
I
wont
allow
it
aint
gon
coward
to
no
bully
Ill
be
damned
if
I
dont
stand
up
to
a
bully
Fight
like
a
man
and
throw
my
hands
up
to
a
bully
And
I
know
it
must
be
fucking
with
you
emotionally
[Verse]
Now
Im
not
trying
to
make
no
more
enemies
No
more
unfortunately
Theres
so
many
motherfuckers
that
just
are
They
just
keep
pounding
at
me
Now
that
Im
down
with
50
Suddenly
now
I
got
beef
with
this
faggot
Ja
[laughter]
But
his
ass
is
such
a
puppet
Irv
could
shove
his
whole
hand
up
it
And
just
make
him
say
what
he
wants
him
to
say
But
Suge
has
Irvs
on
a
string
And
Irvs
so
nervous
that
he
Says
anything
to
this
man
to
keep
him
at
bay
So
now
Ja
thinks
that
hes
so
tough
And
Murder
Incs
the
big
bad
wolf
And
they
go
huff
and
puff
and
blow
our
label
down
But
our
buildings
made
out
of
bricks
So
you
aint
taking
out
shit
I
dawg
you
just
did
a
song
with
Bobby
Brown
So
now
you
try
to
pull
a
race
card
And
it
backfires
in
your
face
hard
Cuz
you
know
we
dont
play
that
black
and
white
shit
Plus
this
stylist
that
you
fucked
When
you
was
ecstasied
up
Was
just
a
man
whos
dressed
up
as
a
white
bitch
[Chorus]
You
must
be
taking
to
much
E
[Verse]
Now
what
bothers
me
the
most
About
hip-hop
is
we
so
close
To
picking
up
where
we
left
off
with
Big
and
Pac
We
just
lost
Jam
Master
J
Big
L
got
blasted
away
Plus
we
lost
Bugs
Slang
Toungue
and
Freaky
Ta
Its
like
a
never-ending
cycle
That
just
seems
to
come
full
circle
Everybodys
gotta
be
so
fucking
hard
Im
not
excluding
myself
Cuz
I
been
stupid
as
well
I
been
known
to
lose
it
when
someone
says
something
smart
But
as
we
grow
as
men
We
learn
to
let
shit
go
but
then
again
Theres
only
so
much
bullshit
we
can
really
stand
We
all
got
reps
to
uphold
When
someone
steps
on
our
toes
Its
no
exception
it
goes
for
every
man
But
if
Irv
really
gave
a
fuck
About
Ja
like
he
claims
he
does
Hed
wake
him
up
and
make
his
boy
get
off
them
drugs
But
he
just
keeps
feeding
him
pills
So
if
that
E
doesnt
kill
him
Someone
from
G-Unit
will
and
I
aint
buzzed
Dawg
Im
talking
to
you
straight
If
the
situation
escalates
Any
worse
were
gonna
lose
another
soldier
to
this
game
And
if
I
get
killed
for
this
rap
I
got
a
million
in
cash
That
says
I
will
get
you
back
in
Halies
name
[Chorus]
Irvine
get
your
boy
off
that
E
[Spoken]
Get
at
me

Good
mornin
Haha
wake

mother

Yo

is
the
what
Well
come
on
then
you
know
what
time
it
is
Stop
sleepin
on
my
roof
bitch
For
whatever
its
worth
its
worth
me
havin
my
arse
whipped
Cause
Ima
have
the
last
lift
that
ever
gets
arse
squished
I
just
cant
get
past
these
little
pissants
That
wanna
be
rauny
bad
asses
so
bad
And
they
so
mad
they
cant
stand
it
Cause
we
can
and
they
cant
spit
Haawk
And
they
cant
handle
it
like
a
man
And
thats
when
it
just
happens
And
I
snap
and
its
a
wrap
and
its
a
scrap
an
then
it
isnt
rap
is
it
Hip-Hop
isnt
a
sport
anymore
when
you
got
to
go
and
resort
back
into
that
shit
Maybe
Im
old
fashioned
but
my
pashion
Is
to
smash
anyone
rappin
without
havin
a
slappin
Believe
me
Id
much
rather
pick
up
a
pencil
than
a
pistol
but
Im
pissed
now
But
it
all
depends
on
just
how
far
it
gets
took
on
the
mic
Cause
Im
tellin
you
right
now
your
not
gonna
like
it
Cause
if
I
get
pushed
over
the
edge
then
Im
pullin
you
with
me
You
poke
a
stick
at
a
big
boy
you
get
bit
B
These
words
stick
to
you
like
crazy
glue
When
you
diss
me
cause
they
just
bounce
off
me
like
bullets
do
fifty
Im
the
beatiful-est
thing
and
your
gonna
miss
me
when
Im
gone
Like
Kieth
Murry
when
he
threw
a
stool
and

Satan
spawn

Momma

And

dad
[Chorus]
Predominantly
predominantly
everythings

Predominantly
white
predominantly
black
Well

about
me
where
does
that
leave
me
Well
I
guess
that
Im
between
predominantly
both
of

I
think
if
I
hear
that
fuckin
word
again
Imma
scream
While
Im
projectile
vomiting
what
do
I
look
like
a
comedian
to
you
Do
you
think
that
Im
kidding
What
do
I
look
like
some
kind
of
idi-wait
a
minute
shit
dont

Why
am
I
so
misunderstood
Why
do
I
go
through
so
much
bullshit
it
sucks
bullshit
its
tush
mull
bish
Woe
is
me
there
goes
poor
Marshall
again
Whining
about
his
millions
and
his
mansion
and
his
sorrow
hes
always
drownin
in
And
the
dad
that
he
never
had
and
how
his
childhood
was
so
bad
And
how
his
mom
was
a
dope
addict
and
his
ex-wife
how
they
go
at
it
Man
Id
hate
to
have
it
as
bad
as
that
Mr
Mathers
claims
he
had
it
I
cant
imagine
it
that
little
rich
poor
white
bastard
Needs
to
take
some
of
that
cash
out
the
bank
and
take
a
bath
in
it
Man
if
I
only
had
half
of
it
If
you
only
knew
the
half
of
it
[Chorus]
Evil
deeds
while
I
plant
these
evil
seeds
Please
release
me
from
these
deamons
I
never
had
any
of
this
shit
planned
ma
please
believe
I
dont
wanna
be
Satans
spawn
never
got
the
chance
to
say
Im
sorry
Now
look
at
all
the
pain
I
caused
Dear
Santa
Clause
why
you
not
comin
this
year
again
What
did
I
do
that
was
so
bad
to
deserve
this
Everything
could
have
been
so
perfect
But
life
aint
a
fairytale
Im
about
to
be
hoist
up
in
the
air
Forty
feet
below
me
theres
people
everywhere
I
dont
even
know
what
it
feel
like
they
know
me
cuz
Im
in
this
ferris
wheel
And
all
i
wanna
do
is
go
to
the
mall
and
take
hailie
on
the
carousel
Without
this
crowd
everywhere
I
go
but
life
is
like
a
merry-go-round
Here
we
go
now
doe
see
doe
now
curtains
up
the
show
must
go
now
Ring
around
the
rosie
the
shows
over
you
can
all
go
home
now
But
the
curtain
just
dont
close
for
me
this
aint
how
fame
is
supposed
to
be
Wheres
the
switch
I
could
just
turn
off
and
on
this
aint
what
I
chose
to
be
So
please
god
give
me
the
strength
to
have
what
it
takes
to
carry
on
Till
I
pass
50
back
the
baton
the
cameras
on
my
soul
is
gone
[Chorus
x2]
[Eminem]
Theres
not
much
you
could
do
or
say
to
phase
me
People
think
Im
a
little
bit
crazy
I
get
it
from
all
angles
even
occasionally
Doc
Dre-ziell
Have
to
step
in
every
once
in
a
while
to
save
me
To
make
me
stop
and
think
about
it
fore
I
just
say
things
Sometimes
I
forget
what
other
people
just
may
think
A
lot
of
rappers
finally
wouldnt
know
how
to
take
me
If
they
heard
some
shit
Id
lay
the
tape
fore
they
erase
me
I
maybe
a
little
too
fast
paced
and
racy
Sometimes
the
average
listener
rewinds
and
plays
me
twenty
times
cuz
I
say
so
many
rhymes
it
may
seem
like
Im
goin
too
fast
cuz
my
mind
is
racing
And
I
could
give
a
fuck
what
category
you
place
me
Long
as
when
Im
pushing
up
daisies
and
gone
As
long
as
you
place
me
amongst
one
of
them
greats
When
I
hit
the
heavenly
gates
Ill
be
cool
beside
Jay-Z
For
every
single
die
hard
fan
who
embraced
me
Im
thankful
for
the
talent
in
which
God
gave
me
And
Im
thankful
for
the
environment
that
he
placed
me
Believe
it
or
not
I
thank
my
mom
for
how
she
raised
me
In
the
neighborhood
daily
they
jumped
and
chased
me
It
only
made
me
what
I
am
today
see
Regardless
of
what
anybody
believes
who
hates
me
You
aint
gonna
make
or
break
me
Tryna
strip
me
of
my
credibility
and
make
me
look
fake
G
Youre
only
gonna
be
in
for
a
rude
awakening
Cuz
sooner
or
later
you
haters
are
all
gonna
face
me
And
when
you
face
me
with
all
the
shit
youve
been
saving
to
say
to
me
You
had
all
this
time
to
think
about
it
Now
dont
pussy
out
and
try
to
about
face
me
Cuz
Ive
been
patiently
waiting
for
the
day
That
we
finally
meet
in
the
same
place
to
see
[Chorus
x2
-
Nate
Dogg]
No
matter
how
many
battles
I
been
in
and
won
No
matter
how
many
magazines
on
my
nuts
No
matter
how
many
MCs
I
eat
up
Ooh
ooh
its
never
enough
[50
Cent]
My
flows
untouchable
now
you
gotta
face
it
Uh
oh
it
gets
worse
when
I
go
back
to
the
basics
You
go
say
the
wrong
shit
and
get
your
face
split
The
smell
of
victory
love
it
so
much
I
can
taste
it
I
spot
my
target
blaze
it
direct
hit
Graze
it
your
peace
talk
save
it
You
shit
sounds
dated
youre
overrated
Im
obligated
to
study
your
moves
then
crush
you
mutherfuckers
If
Im
the
best
and
the
worst
then
Gods
gift
is
a
curse
Soldier
trained
to
destroy
you
payin
attention
boy
I
spit
shit
slick
shit
so
quick
you
miss
it
To
be
specific
I
go
ballistic
as
hieroglyphic
My
music
is
a
drug
press
play
you
aint
gotta
sniff
it
Chew
it
or
pop
it
roll
a
bag
or
chop
it
Get
your
high
over
and
over
but
you
gotta
cop
it
When
its
hot
its
hot
Your
hatin
is
undeniable
stop
it
[Chorus
x2]
[Intro]
What
we
have
to
do
is
deal
with
it
when
these
individuals
are
young
enough
If
you
wish
to
be
saved
not
in
a
religious
sense
but
not
to
constitute
what
this
country
at
times
calls
if
or
which
over
We
seem
to
be
approaching
an
age
of
the
gross
We
all
have
this
idea
that
we
should
move
up
from
our
parents
station
and
each
generation
should
do
a
little
bit
better
[Verse
1-
Eminem]
Come
on
lets
cut
the
bullshit
enough
Lets
get
it
started
lets
start
addressing
this
issue
and
open
it
up
Lets
take
this
shit
back
to
bassmint
And
we
can
disscuss
statements
thats
made
on
this
tape
And
its
whole
origin
of
the
music
that
we
all
know
and
love
The
music
that
we
all
enjoy
the
music
you
all
accuse
me
of
tryna
destroy
Lets
rewind
it
to
89
when
I
was
a
boy
on
the
east
side
of
Detroit
Crossin
8
Mile
into
Warren
into
hick
territory
Id
like
to
share
a
story
this
is
my
story
and
cant
no
body
tell
it
for
me
You
will
well
inform
me
I
am
well
aware
that
I
dont
belong
here
Youve
made
that
perfectly
clear
I
get
my
ass
kicked
damn
near
everywhere
From
Bel-Air
shopping
center
just
for
stopping
in
there
From
the
black
side
all
the
way
to
the
white
side
Okay
theres
a
bright
side
a
day
that
I
might
slide
You
may
call
it
a
past
I
call
it
haulin
my
ass
Through
that
patch
of
grass
over
them
railroad
tracks
Oh
them
railroad
tracks
them
old
railroad
tracks
Them
good
old
notorious
oh
well
known
tracks
[Chorus
x2]
Come
on
lets
go
back
Follow
the
yellow
brick
road
as
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with
me
as
I
take
you
through
this
nifty
little
place
I
once
used
to
call
home
sweet
home
[Verse
2-
Eminem]
I
roam
the
streets
so
much
they
call
me
a
drifter
Sometimes
I
stick
up
a
thumb
just
to
hitch
hike
Just
to
get
picked
up
to
get
me
a
lift
to
8
mile
and
Van
Dyke
And
steal
a
god
damn
bike
from
somebodys
backyard
And
drop
it
off
at
the
park
that
was
the
half
way
mark
To
meet
Kim
had
to
walk
back
to
her
mamas
on
Chalmers
after
dark
To
sneak
me
in
the
house
when
Im
kicked
out
my
moms
Thats
about
the
time
I
first
met
Proof
with
Goofy
Gary
on
the
steps
At
Osbourne
handing
out
some
flyers
he
was
doin
some
talent
shows
At
Centerline
High
I
had
told
him
to
stop
by
and
check
this
out
sometime
He
looked
at
me
like
Im
out
my
mind
shook
his
head
like
white
boys
dont
know
how
to
rhyme
I
spit
out
a
line
and
rhymed
birthday
with
first
place
And
we
both
had
the
same
rhymes
that
sound
alike
We
was
on
the
same
shit
that
Big
Daddy
Kane
shit
with
compound
syllables
sound
combined
From
that
day
we
was
down
to
ride
somehow
we
knew
wed
meet
again
somewhere
down
the
line
[Chorus
x2]
Come
on
lets
go
back
Follow
the
yellow
brick
road
as
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with
me
as
I
take
you
through
this
nifty
little
place
I
once
used
to
call
home
sweet
home
[Verse
3-
Eminem]
My
first
year
in
9th
grade
cant
forget
that
day
at
school
It
was
cool
till
your
man
MC
Sham
came
through
And
said
that
Pumas
The
Brand
cause
the
clan
makes
troops
It
was
rumors
but
man
god
damned
they
flew
Musta
been
true
because
man
we
done
banned
they
shoes
I
had
the
new
ones
the
Cool
J
Ice
land
swayed
too
And
we
just
through
them
in
the
trash
like
they
yesterdays
news
Guess
who
came
through
next
X
clam
debut
Professor
X
and
glorious
exists
in
a
state
of
red
black
and
green
With
a
key

this
bein
a
new
trend
We
dont
fit
in
crackas
is
out
with
Cactus
albums
Blackness

in
African
symbols
and
medallions
Represents
black
power
and
we
aint
know
what
it
meant
Me
and
my
man
Howard
and
would
go
to
the
mall
with
em
All
over
our
necks
like
were
showin
em
off
not
knowin
at
all
We
was
bein
laughed
at
you

You
aint
supposed
to
have
that
homie
let
me
grab
that
And
that
Flavor
Flave
clock
we
gon
have
to
snatch
that
All
I
remember
is
meetin
back
at
Manixs
basement
Sayin
how
we
hate
this
our
races
wit
dope
the
x
clan
take
this
Which
reminds
me
back
in
89
me
and
Kim
broke
up
for
the
first
time
She
was
tryna
two
time
me
and
there
was
this
black
girl
At
our
school
who
thought
I
was
cool
cuz
I
rapped
so
she
was
kinda
eyein
me
And
oh
the
irony
guess
what
her
name
was
aint
even
gon
say
it
plus
The
same
color
hair
as
hers
was
and
blue
contacts
and
a
pair
of
jugs
The
bombest
god
damn
girl
in
our
whole
school
if
I
could
pull
it
Not
only
would
I
become
more
popular
but
I
would
be
able
to
piss
Kim
off
at
the
same
time
But
it
backfired
I
was
supposed
to
dump
her
but
she
dumped
me
for
this
black
guy
And
thats
the
last
I
ever
seen
or
heard
or
spoke
to
the
oh
foolish
pride
girl
But
Ive
heard
people
say
they
heard
the
tape
and
it
aint
that
bad
But
it
was
I
singled
out
a
whole
race
and
for
that
apologize
I
was
wrong
cuz
no
matter
what
color
a
girl
is
she
still
a
hoe
[Chorus
x2]
Come
on
lets
go
back
Follow
the
yellow
brick
road
as
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with
me
as
I
take
you
through
this
nifty
little
place
I
once
used
to
call
home
sweet
home
Step
by
step
heart
to
heart
left
right
left
we
all
fall
down
Step
by
step
heart
to
heart
Left
right
left
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
Im
supposed
to
be
the
soldier
Who
never
blows
his
composure
Even
though
I
hold
the
weight
of
the
whole
world
on
my
shoulders
I
aint
never
supposed
to
show
it
My
crew
aint
supposed
to
know
it
Even
if
it
means
going
toe
to
toe
with
a
Benzino
It
dont
matter
Id
never
drag
them
in
battles
that
I
can
handle
Less
I
absolutely
have
to
Im
supposed
to
set
an
example
I
need
to
be
the
leader
my
crew
looks
for
me
to
guide
em
If
some
shit
ever
does
pop
off
Im
supposed
to
be
beside
em
That
Ja
shit
I
tried
to
squash
it
It
was
too
late
to
stop
it
Theres
a
certain
line
you
just
dont
cross
and
he
crossed
it
I
heard
him
say
Hailies
name
on
a
song
And
I
just
lost
it
it
was
crazy
The
shit
went
way
beyond
some
Jay
Z
and
Nas
shit
And
even
though
the
battle
is
won
I
feel
like
we
lost
it
I
spent
so
much
energy
on
it
honestly
Im
exhausted
And
Im
so
caught
in
it
I
almost
feel
Im
the
one
who
caused
it
This
aint
what
Im
in
hip
hop
for
its
not
why
I
got
in
it
That
was
never
my
object
for
someone
to
get
killed
Why
would
I
want
to
destroy
something
I
helped
build
It
wasnt
my
intentions
my
intentions
were
good
I
went
through
my
whole
career
without
ever
mentioning
And
that
was
just
outta
respect
for
not
running
my
mouth
And
talking
about
something
that
I
knew
nothing
about
Plus
Dre
told
me
stay
out
this
just
wasnt
my
beef
So
I
did
I
just
fell
back
watched
and
gritted
my
teeth
While
hes
all
over
TV
Down-talking
the
man
who
literally
saved
my
life
Like
fuck
it
I
understand
This
is
business
and
this
shit
just
isnt
none
of
my
business
Im
still
knowing
this
shit
could
pop
off
at
any
minute
cause
Step
by
step
heart
to
heart
Left
right
left
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
There
used
to
be
a
time
when
you
could
just
say
a
rhyme
and
Wouldnt
have
to
worry
about
one
of
your
people
dyin
But
now
its
elevated
Cause
once
you
put
someones
kids
in
it
The
shit
gets
escalated
it
aint
just
words
no
more
is
it
Its
a
different
ball
game
You
call
names
and
you
aint
just
rappin
We
actually
tried
to
stop
the
50
and
Ja
beef
from
happenin
Me
and
Dre
had
sat
with
him
Kicked
it
and
had
a
chat
with
him
And
asked
him
not
to
start
it
he
wasnt
gonna
go
after
him
Until
Ja
started
yappin
in
magazines
how
he
stabbed
him
Fuck
it
50
smash
him
Mash
him
and
let
him
have
it
Meanwhile
my
attentions
pulled
in
another
direction
Some
receptionist
at
the
Source
Who
answers
phones
at
his
desk
Has
an
erection
for
me
and
thinks
that
Ill
be
his
resurrection
Tries
to
blow
the
dust
off
his
mic
and
make
a
new
record
But
now
hes
fucked
the
game
up
cause
one
of
the
ways
I
came
up
Was
through
that
publication
The
same
one
that
made
me
famous
Now
the
owner
of
it
has
got
a
grudge
against
me
for
nothin
Well
fuck
it
that
mothafucka
could
get
it
too
fuck
him
then
But
Im
so
busy
being
pissed
off
I
dont
stop
to
think
That
we
just
inherited
50s
beef
with
Murder
Inc
And
hes
inherited
mine
which
is
fine
Aint
like
either
of
us
mind
We
still
have
soldiers
thats
on
the
front
line
Thats
willing
to
die
for
us
as
soon
as
we
give
the
orders
Never
to
extort
us
strictly
to
show
they
support
us
And
maybe
shout
em
out
in
a
rap
or
up
in
the
chorus
To
show
em
we
love
em
back
And
let
them
know
how
important
it
is
To
have
Runyon
Avenue
soldiers
up
in
our
corners
Their
loyalty
to
us
is
worth
more
than
any
award
is
But
I
aint
tryin
to
have
none
of
my
people
hurt
or
murdered
It
aint
worth
it
I
cant
think
of
a
perfecter
way
to
word
it
Than
to
just
say
that
I
love
yall
too
much
to
see
the
verdict
Ill
walk
away
from
it
all
fore
I
let
it
go
any
further
But
dont
get
it
twisted
its
not
a
plea
that
Im
coppin
Im
just
willing
to
be
the
bigger
man
if
yall
can
quit
poppin
Off
at
your
jaws
well
then
I
can
Cause
frankly
Im
sick
of
talkin
Im
not
going
to
let
someone
elses
coffin
rest
on
my
conscience
cause
Step
by
step
heart
to
heart
Left
right
left
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
I
pledge
allegiance
to
the
flag
of
the
United
States
of
America
And
to
the
Republic
for
which
it
stands
One
nation
under
God
Indivisible
It
feels
so
good
to
be
back
I
scrutinize
every
word
memorize
every
line
I
spit
it
once
refuel
and
re-energize
and
rewind
I
give
sight
to
the
blind
my
insight
through
the
mind
I
exercise
my
right
to
express
when
I
feel
its
time
Its
just
all
in
your
mind
what
you
interpret
it
as
I
say
to
fight
you
take
it
as
Imma
whip
someones
ass
If
you
dont
understand
dont
even
bother
to
ask
A
father
who
has
grown
up
with
a
fatherless
past
Who
has
blown
up
now
to
rap
phenomenon
that
has
Or
at
least
shows
no
difficulty
multi-task
And
in
juggling
both
perhaps
mastered
his
craft
Slash
entrepreneur
who
has
held
onto
few
more
rap
acts
Whos
had
a
few
obstacles
thrown
his
way
through
the
last
half
Of
his
career
typical
manure
moving
past
that
Mr
kisses
ass
crack
hes
a
class
act
Rubber
band
man
yea
he
just
snaps
back
[Chorus:]
Come
along
follow
me
as
I
lead
through
the
darkness
As
I
provide
just
enough
spark
that
we
need
to
proceed
Carry
on
give
me
hope
give
me
strength
Come
with
me
and
I
wont
steer
you
wrong
Put
your
faith
and
your
trust
as
I
guide
us
through
the
fog
To
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
We
gonna
fight
we
gonna
charge
we
gonna
stomp
we
gonna
march
Through
the
swamp
we
gonna
mosh
through
the
marsh
Take
us
right
through
the
doors
cmon
All
the
people
up
top
on
the
side
and
the
middle
Come
together
lets
all
bomb
and
swamp
just
a
little
Just
let
it
gradually
build
from
the
front
to
the
back
All
you
can
see
is
a
sea
of
people
some
white
and
some
black
Dont
matter
what
color
all
that
matters
we
gathered
together
To
celebrate
for
the
same
cause
dont
matter
the
weather
If
it
rains
let
it
rain
yea
the
wetter
the
better
They
aint
gonna
stop
us
they
cant
we
stronger
now
more
than
ever
They
tell
us
no
we
say
yea
they
tell
us
stop
we
say
go
Rebel
with
a
rebel
yell
raise
hell
we
gonna
let
em
know
Stomp
push
shove
mush
Fuck
Bush
until
they
bring
our
troops
home
cmon
[Chorus]
Imagine
it
pouring
its
raining
down
on
us
Mosh
pits
outside
the
oval
office
Someones
tryina
tell
us
something
Maybe
this
is
god
just
sayin
were
responsible
For
this
monster
this
coward
That
we
have
empowered
This
is
Bin
Laden
look
at
his
head
noddin
How
could
we
allow
something
like
this
without
pumping
our
fists
Now
this
is
our
final
hour
Let
me
be
the
voice
in
your
strength
and
your
choice
Let
me
simplify
the
rhyme
just
to
amplify
the
noise
Try
to
amplify
the
times
it
and
multiply
by
six
Teen
million
people
Are
equal
at
this
high
pitch
Maybe
we
can
reach
alqueda
through
my
speech
Let
the
president
answer
a
higher
anarchy
Strap
him
with
an
Ak-47
let
him
go
fight
his
own
war
Let
him
impress
daddy
that
way
No
more
blood
for
oil
we
got
our
own
battles
to
fight
on
our
own
soil
No
more
psychological
warfare
to
trick
us
to
thinking
that
we
aint
loyal
If
we
dont
serve
our
own
country
were
patronizing
a
hero
Look
in
his
eyes
its
all
lies
The
stars
and
stripes
theyve
been
swiped
washed
out
and
wiped
And
replaced
with
his
own
face
Mosh
now
or
die
If
I
get
sniped
tonight
you
know
why
Cause
I
told
you
to
fight
[Chorus]
And
as
we
proceed
To
Mosh
through
this
desert
storm
In
these
closing
statements
if
they
should
argue
Let
us
beg
to
differ
As
we
set
aside
our
differences
And
assemble
our
own
army
To
disarm
this
Weapon
of
Mass
Destruction
That
we
call
our
President
for
the
present
And
Mosh
for
the
future
of
our
next
generation
To
speak
and
be
heard
Mr
President
Mr
Senator
Do
you
guys
hear
ushear
us[laughing]
Hailie
[Sounds
of
someone
puking]
There
I
go--thinking
of
you
again
[Chorus]
You
dont
know
how
sick
you
make
me
You
make
me
fuckin
sick
to
my
stomach
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
You
must
just
not
know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You
may
not
think
you
do
but
you
do
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
I
was
gonna
take
the
time
to
sit
down
and
write
you
a
little
poem
But
off
of
the
dome
would
probably
be
a
little
more
more
suitable
for
this
type
of
song--whoa
I
got
a
million
reasons
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
I
could
think
of
Sixteen
bars
this
aint
enough
to
put
some
ink
ta
So
fuck
it
Ima
start
right
here
by
just
be
brief-a
Bout
to
rattle
off
some
other
reasons
I
knew
I
shouldnt
go
and
get
another
tattoo
of
you
On
my
arm
but
what
do
I
go
and
do
I
go
and
get
another
one
now
I
got
two
Ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
Im
sittin
here
with
your
name
on
my
skin
I
cant
believe
I
went
and
did
this
stupid
shit
again
My
next
girlfriend
now
her
names
gotta
be
Kim
Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it
If
you
only
knew
how
much
I
hated
you
For
every
motherfuckin
thing
you
ever
put
us
through
Then
I
wouldnt
be
standing
here
crying
over
you
Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-who
[Chorus]
You
dont
know
how
sick
you
make
me
You
make
me
fuckin
sick
to
my
stomach
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
You
must
just
not
know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You
may
not
think
you
do
but
you
do
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
I
was
gonna
take
the
time
to
sit
down
and
write
you
a
little
letter
But
I
thought
a
song
would
probably
be
a
little
better
Instead
of
a
letter
That
youd
probably
just
shred
up--yeah
I
stumbled
on
your
picture
yesterday
and
it
made
me
stop
and
think
of
How
much
of
a
waste
itd
be
for
me
to
put
some
ink
ta
a
stupid
piece
a
Paper
Id
rather
let
you
see
how
Much
I
fuckin
hate
you
in
a
freestyle
Youre
a
fuckin
coke-head
slut
I
hope
you
fuckin
die
I
hope
you
get
to
hell
and
Satan
sticks
a
needle
in
your
eye
I
hate
your
fuckin
guts
you
fuckin
slut
I
hope
you
die
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie
But
please
dont
get
me
wrong
Im
not
bitter
or
mad
Its
not
that
I
still
love
you
its
not
cause
I
want
you
back
Its
just
that
when
I
think
of
you
it
makes
me
wanna
gag-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag
What
else
can
I
do
I
havent
got
a
clue
Now
I
guess
Ill
just
move
on
I
have
no
choice
but
to
But
every
time
I
think
of
you
now
Ill
I
wanna
do
Is
pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke
[Chorus]
You
dont
know
how
sick
you
make
me
You
make
me
fuckin
sick
to
my
stomach
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
You
must
just
not
know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You
may
not
think
you
do
but
you
do
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
Fuckin
bitch
Ohh
Yeah

Hey
whats
going
on
this
is
Paul
Rosenberg
attorney
of
law
Listen
I
listened
to
the
rough
copy
of
your
album
And
uh
you
know
Ive
just
got
to
be
honest
with
you
Can
you
tone
it
down
a
little
bit
Because
theres
only
so
much
I
can
explain
Give
me
a
call
[Dre
Em]
Yeah
Definately
definately
definately
definately
definately
K-mart
Yeah
yeah
[Eminem
Dr
Dre:]
You
find
me
offensive
I
find
you
offensive
For
finding
me
offensive
Hence
if
I
should
draw
a
line
on
any
fences
If
so
to
what
extense
if
Any
should
I
go
Cause
its
getting
expensive
Being
on
the
other
side
of
the
courtroom
on
the
defensive
They
say
that
I
cause
extensive
Pshycological
nerve
damage
to
the
brain
when
I
go
to
lenghts
this
Far
at
other
peoples
expenses
I
say
your
all
just
too
god
damn
sensitive
Its
censorship
And
its
down
right
blasphomous
Listen
to
shit
now
cause
I
wont
stand
for
this
And
Chirs-stiff-pher
Reeves
wont
sit
for
this
neither
And
lets
clear
this
up
too
I
aint
got
no
beef
with
him
either
He
used
to
be
like
a
hero
to
me
I
even
believe
I
had
one
of
those
25
cent
stickers
on
my
re--fridgerator
Right
next
to
Darth
Vader
And
Darth
must
have
put
a
hex
on
him
for
later
I
feel
like
its
my
fault
cause
of
the
way
that
I
stuck
him
up
in
between
him

Kryptonite:
The
Green
Chronic
[Chorus:]
Cause
I
aint
got
no
legs
Or
no
brain
nice
to
meet
you
Hi
my
name
is
I
forgot
my
name
My
name
was
not
to
become
what
I
became
with
this
level
of
fame
My
soul
is
possessed
by
this
devil
my
new
name
is
Rain
Man
Now
in
the
Bible
it
says
Thou
shalt
not
watch
two
lesbians
in
bed
Have
homosexual
sex
Unless
of
course
you
were
given
the
consent
to
join
in
Then
of
course
its
intercourse
And
its
bi-sexual
sex
Which
isnt
as
bad
as
long
as
you
show
some
remorse
for
your
actions
Either
before
during
or
after
peforming
the
act
of
that
which
Is
normally
referred
to
have
such
more
commonly
known
phrases
That
are
more
used
by
todays
kids
In
a
more
derogatory
way
but
Whos
to
say
whats
fair
to
say
and
what
not
to
say
Lets
ask
Dr
Dre
Dr
Dre
What
up
I
gotta
question
if
I
may
Yeah
Is
it
gay
to
play
Putt-Putt
golf
with
a
friend
Yeah
And
watch
his
butt-butt
when
he
tees
off
Yeah
But
ut
I
aint
done
yet
In
football
the
quarterback
yells
out
hutt-hutt
While
he
reaches
in
another
grown
mans
ass
Grabs
on
his
nuts
but
just
what
if
It
was
never
meant
it
was
just
an
accident
But
he
tripped
fell
slipped
and
his
penis
went
in
His
teeny
tiny
little
round
hiney
but
he
didnt
mean
it
But
his
little
weenie
flinched
just
a
little
bit
And
I
dont
mean
to
go
in
into
any
more
details
but
What
if
he
pictured
it
as
a
females
butt
Is
that
gay
I
just
need
to
clear
things
up
Til
then
ill
just
walk
around
with
a
manly
strut
because
[Chorus]
You
find
me
offensive
I
find
you
offensive
Shit
this
is
the
same
verse
I
just
did
this
When
am
I
gonna
come
to
my
good
senses
Probably
the
day
Bush
comes
to
my
defenceses
My
spider
senses
telling
me
Spiderman
is
nearby
And
my
plan
is
to
get
him
next
And
open
up
a
whip
ass
canister
God
damn
it
Dre
where
is
the
god
damn
beat
Yeah
Anyway
anyway
I
dont
know
how
else
to
put
it
This
is
the
only
thing
that
Im
good
at
I
am
the
bad
guy
Kryptonite:
The
Green

Nick
Lachey
Stuck

And

around
the
room
like
a
balloon-a
Grabbed
the
last
can
of
chicken
tuna
Out

trash
can
and
screw
my
Head

to
the
Neverland
Ranch
With
a
peanut
butter
jelly
chicken
tuna
sandwhich
And
I
dont
gotta
make
no
god
damn
sense
I
just
did
a
whole
song

[Chorus]

Youre

[Chorus]
You
are
just
jealous
of
me
Cuz
you
you
just
cant
do
what
I

So
instead
of
just
admitting
it
You
walk
around
and
say
All
kinds
of
really
mean
things
About
me
cuz
youre
a
meanie

But
its
only
cuz
youre
Just
really
jealous
of
me
Cuz

So

When

these
mean
things
Cuz

too
easy
to

Youre

really
big
weenie
big
weenie
[Verse
1]
Alright
listen
I
need
you
to
focus
I
need
you
to
go
dig
deep
in
your
mind
this
is
important
We
are
going
to
perform
an
experiment
of
the
sorts
Im
going
to
have
to
ask
you
to
bear
with
me
for
a
moment
Now
I
need
you
to
open
your
mind-your
eyes
close
them
You
are
now
about
to
be
placed
under
my
hypnosis
For
the
next
four
and
a
half
minutes
We
are
going
to
explore
into
your
mind
To
find
out
why
youre
so
fuckin
jealous
Now
why
did
they
make
Yoo-Hoo
Hippity
ga-ga
boo-boo
Psych
Im
kidding
I
just
wanted
to
see
if
youre
still
listenin
Ok
now
I
need
your
undivided
attention
Sir
I
have
a
question
Why
do
I
always
sense
this
undeniable
tension
From
the
moment
that
I
enter
into
the
room
It
gets
all
quiet
and
whispers
Whenever
theres
conversation
why
am
I
always
mentioned
Ive
been
dying
to
ask
its
been
itchin
at
me
Is
it
just
because
[Chorus]
[Verse
2]
Alright
now
I
I
just
flubbed
a
line
I
was
going
to
say
something
extremely
important
But
I
forgot
who
or
what
it
was
I
fucked
up
Psych
Im
kidding
again
you
idiot
no
I
didnt
Thats
just
what
you
wanted
to
hear
from
me
Is
that
I
fucked
up
aint
it
But
I
can
bust
one
take
without
lookin
at
no
paper
It
doesnt
take
a
bunch
of
takes
Or
me
to
stand
here
in
this
booth
all
day
For
me
to
say
the
truth
ok
Youre
droolin
you
have
tooth
decay
Your
mouth
is
open
youre
disgusting
What
the
fuck
you
eat
for
lunch
A
bunch
of
sweets
or
something
what
You
munch
a
bunch
of
Crunch
N
Munch
Your
tooth
is
rotten
to
the
gum
Your
breath
stinks
wanna
chew
some
gum
Yes
I
do
sir
what
am
I
on
You
sir
are
on
chew
syrum
Marshall
Im
so
jealous
of
you
Please
say
you
wont
tell
nobody
Id
be
so
embarrassed
Im
just
absolutely
terrified
That
someones
gonna
find
out
why
Im
saying
All
these
terrible
evil
and
awful
mean
things
Its
my
own
insecurity
[Chorus]
[Verse
3]
Alright
now
we
were
going
to
conduct
That
experiment
that
we
were
talking
about
earlier
Just
to
see
what
a
frog
looks
like
when
it
takes
two
hits
of
ecstasy
Cuz
thats
exactly
what
your
eyes
look
like
want
to
check
to
see
Heres
a
mirror
notice
the
resemblence
here
Wait
let
me
put
these
sun
glasses
on
Now
look
in
this
mirror
how
about
now
What
do
you
have
in
common
Youre
both
green
with
envy
and
look
like
idiots
with
sunglasses
on
em
You
look
like
I
sound
like
singing
about
weenies
Now
take
my
weenie
out
of
your
mouth
This
is
between
me
and
you
I
know
youre
not
happy
I
know
youd
much
rather
see
me
lying
in
the
corner
of
a
room
somewhere
crying
Curled
up
in
a
ball
tweeked
out
of
my
mind
dying
There
is
no
denying
that
my
weenie
is
much
bigger
than
yours
is
Mine
is
like
sticking
a
banana
between
two
oranges
Why
you
even
doing
this
to
yourself
its
pointless
Why
do
we
have
to
keep
on
going
through
this
this
is
tortuous
My
point
is
this
That
if
you
say
mean
things
weenie
will
shrink
Now
I
fogot
what
the
chorus
is
your
just
is
[Chorus]
Eminem
-
Em
Calls
Paul
Skit
Encore
Aye
yo
Paul
Its
Em
I
got
your
call
about
the
Michael
Jackson
thing

startin
somethin
Well
Ill
show
him
whos
really
bad
Paul
the
way
you
make
me
feel
with
these
calls
You

really
take
a
look
at
the
man
in
the
mirror
And
tell
him
to
beat
it
because
I
wont
stop
till
I
get
enough
Do
you
remember
the
time
we
were
watching
the
Billy
Jean
video
Well
hell
always
be
that
Michael
to
me
And
it
doesnt
matter
if
hes
black
or
white
Because
I
cant
stop
loving
him
and
I
hate
plastic
surgeons
And
I
hope
they
all
fucking
die
How
do
you
like
that
And
I
like
him
I
like
him
a
lot
I
want
to
touch
him

cant
Excuse

ha
[Eminem]
If
theres
any
bitches
in
this
room
then
theres
something
I
gotta
say
For
all
the
fools
who
fell
for
the
first
girl
who
comes
their
way
Ive
been
down
that
road
and
now
Im
back
sittin
on
square
one
Tryna
pick
myself
up
where
I
started
from
[Obie
Trice]
I
never
woulda
thought
that
Id
see
you
outta
control
Even
though
my
penis
was
deep
down
in
your
hole
You
should
know
between
us
we
was
like
mates
to
soul
Nothing
could
intervene
us
especially
no
hoes
You
was
more
or
so
the
chalant
type
I
chose
To
more
shows
haunted
you
nights
I
suppose
Thats
how
it
go
with
time
spent
emotion
grows
In
the
beginning
friends
we
decided
to
roll
So
whos
responsible
when
you
get
excited
explode
And
Obies
grinning
then
you
invite
that
Obies
cold
But
bitches
the
gon
talk
niggas
they
gon
hate
We
established
this
way
before
we
became
mates
So
whats
required
is
that
you
chill
with
all
that
fire
Get
your
desire
when
I
retire
[Chorus]
Spend
some
time
with
me
say
that
youll
be
mine
I
never
thought
Id
find
someone
to
be
mine
Lord
knows
I
was
right
cuz
you
just
crossed
the
line
Spend
some
time
with
me
say
that
youll
be
mine
[Eminem]
I
used
to
say
I
never
met
a
girl
like
you
before
Still
aint
got
a
fuckin
clue
as
to
who
you
truly
are
Almost
went
as
far
as
introducing
you
to
my
daughters
Till
you
went
as
far
as
goin
and
snoopin
through
my
drawers
Now
I
just
feel
stupid
for
the
loop
that
you
threw
me
for
Cant
believe
I
almost
flew
the
coop
for
some
stupid
whore
You
used
to
say
all
you
wanted
was
for
me
to
be
yours
All
I
ever
wanted
from
you
was
a
few
booty
calls
If
you
recall
I
used
to
treat
you
as
a
groupie
broad
When
we
fucked
I
refused
to
even
take
my
jewelry
off
But
it
threw
me
off
the
first
time
I
called
and
you
blew
me
off
It
was
a
shock
it
struck
me
as
odd
but
it
turned
me
on
You
started
getting
moody
on
me
pretty
soon
wed
argue
And
the
ruder
you
got
the
more
beautiful
you
got
to
me
And
who
woulda
even
knew
that
who
woulda
even
thought
possibly
Cupid
could
shoot
another
one
of
them
God
damn
darts
at
me
Its
true
that
I
got
shot
in
the
heart
But
when
someone
seems
too
good
to
be
true
they
usually
are
But
see
when
youre
in
it
its
too
hard
to
see
Till
you
pull
up
and
see
some
other
dudes
car
parked
and
reach
Up
under
the
seat
as
your
heart
starts
to
beat
Before
you
make
a
decision
thats
life
altering
And
just
as
you
halt
and
you
turn
and
you
start
to
leave
You
hear
them
words
echoing
almost
haunting
that
taunting
ring
[Chorus]
[Stat
Quo]
In
most
cases
Stats
attitude
is
fuck-a-bitch
My
only
motive
is
to
get
head
and
fuck
a
bitch
But
you
was
different
thought
we
shared
a
covenant
Even
held
your
hand
in
public
we
sufferin
because
of
this
Shorty
on
some
whole
notha
other
shit
Tryna
play
sick
thinkin
imma
trick
off
rick
Ill
admit
I
was
caught
in
the
mix
down
to
commit
Feed
you
the
best
of
me
I
shoulda
fed
you
piss
We
started
off
closer
than
close
But
who
coulda
predicted
to
know
your
triflin
ways
woulda
stopped
our
growth
And
the
final
result
back
in
that
same
boat
I
ask
myself
do
I
love
these
hoes
NO
[50
cent]
Em
introduced
us
50
this
is
Tanya
Tanya
this
is
50
Then
slid
off
and
left
her
to
kick
it
with
me
I
complimented
her
I
said
you
have
very
nice
lips
With
my
imagination
I
could
see
her
suckin
my
dick
We
played
the
phone
game
a
week
later
shit
changed
fast
Had
her
comin
over
in
a
cab
to
give
me
some
ass
Downtown
Manhattan
on
the
balcony
stare
at
the
skyline
Penthouse
full
of
imported
shit
you
know
how
I
grind
She
got
to
talkin
talkin
like
an
opportunist
too
Why
talk
when
suckin
my
dick
is
the
real
career
move
Said
shes
an
inspiring
actress
she
do
videos
for
practice
Yeah
yeah
know
how
many
times
had
I
heard
that
shit
[Chorus]
Yeah
I
know
sometimes
things
may
not
always
make
sense
to
you
right
now
But
hey
what
daddy
always
tell
you
Straighten
up
little
soldier
Stiffen
up
that
upper
lip
What
you
crying
about
You
got
me
Hailie
I
know
you
miss
your
mom
and
I
know
you
miss
your
dad
When
Im
gone
but
Im
trying
to
give
you
the
life
that
I
never
had
I
can
see
youre
sad
even
when
you
smile
even
when
you
laugh
I
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
deep
inside
you
want
to
cry
Cuz
youre
scared
I
aint
there
Daddys
with
you
in
your
prayers
No
more
crying
wipe
them
tears
Daddys
here
no
more
nightmares
We
gon
pull
together
through
it
we
gon
do
it
Laney
uncles
crazy
aint
he
Yeah
but
he
loves
you
girl
and
you
better
know
it
Were
all
we
got
in
this
world
When
it
spins
when
it
swirls
When
it
whirls
when
it
twirls
Two
little
beautiful
girls
Lookin
puzzled
in
a
daze
I
know
its
confusing
you
Daddys
always
on
the
move
mammas
always
on
the
news
I
try
to
keep
you
sheltered
from
it
but
somehow
it
seems
The
harder
that
I
try
to
do
that
the
more
it
backfires
on
me
All
the
things
growing
up
his
daddy
that
he
had
to
see
Daddy
dont
want
you
to
see
but
you
see
just
as
much
as
he
did
We
did
not
plan
it
to
be
this
way
your
mother
and
me
But
things
have
gotten
so
bad
between
us
I
dont
see
us
ever
being
together
ever
again
Like
we
used
to
be
when
we
was
teenagers
But
then
of
course
everything
always
happens
for
a
reason
I
guess
it
was
never
meant
to
be
But
its
just
something
we
have
no
control
over
and
thats
what
destiny
is
But
no
more
worries
rest
your
head
and
go
to
sleep
Maybe
one
day
well
wake
up
and
this
will
all
just
be
a
dream
Now
hush
little
baby
dont
you
cry
Everythings
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up
little
lady
I
told
ya
Daddys
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
mommys
not
here
right
now
and
we
dont
know
why
We
feel
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy
pretty
baby
But
I
promise
mommas
gon
be
alright
Its
funny
I
remember
back
one
year
when
daddy
had
no
money
Mommy
wrapped
the
Christmas
presents
up
And
stuck
em
under
the
tree
and
said
some
of
em
were
from
me
Cuz
daddy
couldnt
buy
em
Ill
never
forget
that
Christmas
I
sat
up
the
whole
night
crying
Cuz
daddy
felt
like
a
bum
see
daddy
had
a
job
But
his
job
was
to
keep
the
food
on
the
table
for
you
and
mom
And
at
the
time
every
house
that
we
lived
in
Either
kept
getting
broken
into
and
robbed
Or
shot
up
on
the
block
and
your
mom
was
saving
money
for
you
in
a
jar
Tryna
start
a
piggy
bank
for
you
so
you
could
go
to
college
Almost
had
a
thousand
dollars
till
someone
broke
in
and
stole
it
And
I
know
it
hurt
so
bad
it
broke
your
mommas
heart
And
it
seemed
like
everything
was
just
startin
to
fall
apart
Mom
and
dad
was
arguin
a
lot
so
momma
moved
back
On
the
Chalmers
in
the
flat
one
bedroom
apartment
And
dad
moved
back
to
the
other
side
of
8
Mile
on
Novara
And
thats
when
daddy
went
to
California
with
his
CD
and
met
Dr
Dre
And
flew
you
and
momma
out
to
see
me
But
daddy
had
to
work
you
and
momma
had
to
leave
me
Then
you
started
seeing
daddy
on
the
TV
and
momma
didnt
like
it
And
you
and
Laney
were
to
young
to
understand
it
Papa
was
a
rollin
stone
momma
developed
a
habit
And
it
all
happened
too
fast
for
either
one
of
us
to
grab
it
Im
just
sorry
you
were
there
and
had
to
witness
it
first
hand
Cuz
all
I
ever
wanted
to
do
was
just
make
you
proud
Now
Im
sittin
in
this
empty
house
just
reminiscing
Lookin
at
your
baby
pictures
it
just
trips
me
out
To
see
how
much
you
both
have
grown
its
almost
like
youre
sisters
now
Wow
guess
you
pretty
much
are
and
daddys
still
here
Laney
Im
talkin
to
you
too
daddys

here
I
like
the
sound
of
that
yeah
Its
got
a
ring
to
it
dont
it
Shh
mommas
only
gone
for
the
moment
Now
hush
little
baby
dont
you
cry
Everythings
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up
little
lady
I
told
ya
Daddys
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
mommys
not
here
right
now
and
we
dont
know
why
We
feel
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy
pretty
baby
But
I
promise
mommas
gon
be
alright
And
if
you
ask
me
too
Daddys
gonna
buy
you
a
mockingbird
Imma
give
you
the
world
Imma
buy
a
diamond
ring
for
you
Imma
sing
for
you
Ill
do
anything
for
you
to
see
you
smile
And
if
that
mockingbird

and
that
ring
dont

Imma

that
birdies
neck
Id
go
back
to
the
jewler

And

[Ann
Wilsons
voice]
I
Tell
myself
that
Im
doing
alright
Nothing
else
to
do
tonight
but
To
go
Crazy
Crazy
On
You
Lemme
go
Crazy
Crazy
on
you
youuuuuuuuu
[Verse
1]
Cant
you
see
what
you
do
to
me
baby
You
make
me
crazy
you
make
me
act
like
a
maniac
Im
like
a
lunatic
you
make
me
sick
You
truly
are
the
only
one
who
can
do
this
to
me
You
just
make
me
get
so
crazy
I
go
skitzo
I
get
so
insane
I
just
go
skitzophrenic
One
minute
I
want
to
slit
your
throat
The
next
I
want
sex
You
make
me
crazy
the
way
we
act
like
2
maniacs
in
the
sac
We
fuck
like
2
jackrabbits
And
maybe
thats
a
bad
habit
Cuz
the
next
day
were
right
back
at
it
In
the
same
exact
pattern
What
the
fuck
is
the
matter
with
us
We
cant
figure
out
if
its
Lust
or
its
love
Whats
sad
is
whats
attracting
us
to
each
other
They
say
that
every
man
grows
up
to
marry
his
own
mother
Which
would
explain
why
youre
such
a
motherfucking
bitch
But
I
stay
and
still
stick
it
out
with
you
even
though
I
just
hit
you
today
But
you
deserve
it
you
hit
me
first
and
provoked
me
to
choke
you
Just
cuz
I
came
home
late
last
night
crawled
in
bed
and
I
woke
you
But
if
theres
one
thing
about
you
I
admire
its
baby
Because
you
stay
with
me
maybe
because
youre
as
crazy
as
I
am
Cuz
when
I
look
at
you
I
can
see
an
angel
in
your
eyes
But
if
I
look
deeper
inside
I
see
your
freakish
little
side
Like
a
devil
in
disguise
Youre
always
full
of
surprises
Always
pullin
devises
Out
your
personal
vibrators
and
dildos
You
fucked
yourself
so
much
You
barely
feel
those
anymore
Youre
only
24
but
youre
plenty
more
mature
Than
those
other
little
hoes
Who
just
act
like
little
girls
Like
theyre
in
middle
school
still
Youre
crazy
sexy
cool
chillin
You
play
your
position
You
never
step
out
of
line
Even
though
I
stay
in
your
business
Youve
always
kept
out
of
mine
I
wonder
whats
on
your
mind
Sometimes
they
say
love
is
blind
Maybe
thats
why
the
first
time
I
dotted
your
eye
You
aint
see
a
sign
[with
Chorus]
Or
maybe
you
did
Maybe
you
like
being
shoved
Maybe
cuz
were
crazy
in
loooove
[Chorus]
Crazy
on
you
Crazy
on
you
Let
me
go
crazy
crazy
on
youuuuuuuuu
[Verse
2]
Youre
the
ink
to
my
paper
Where
my
pen
is
to
my
pad
The
moral
the
very
fiber
The
whole
substance
to
my
rap
You
are
my
reason
for
being
The
meaning
of
my
existence
If
it
wasnt
for
you
I
would
never
be
able
to
spit
this
As
intence
I
do
and
the
irony
Is
you
rely
on
me
as
much
as
I
rely
on
you
to
inspire
me
like
you
do
You
provide
me
the
lighter
fluid
to
fuel
my
fire
Youre
my
entire
supply
Gas
the
match
the
igniter
The
only
way
that
I
am
able
to
stay
so
stable
Is
youre
the
legs
to
my
table
If
you
were
to
break
Id
fall
on
my
face
But
Im
always
going
to
make
you
feel
I
dont
need
you
as
much
as
I
really
need
you
So
you
dont
use
it
to
your
advantage
But
youre
essential
to
me
Youre
the
air
I
breathe
I
believe
if
you
ever
leave
me
Id
probably
have
no
reason
to
be
You
are
the
Kim
to
my
Marshall
Youre
the
Slim
to
my
Shady
The
Dre
to
my
Eminem
The
Elaina
to
my
Hailey
You
are
the
word
I
am
looking
for
when
Im
trying
to
describe
how
I
feel
inside
And
the
right
one
just
wont
come
to
my
mind
Youre
like
the
pillar
that
props
me
up
The
beam
that
supports
me
The
bitch
who
never
took
half
The
wife
who
never
divorced
me
Youre
like
the
root
to
my
evil
You
let
my
devil
come
out
me
You
let
me
beat
the
shit
out
you
Before
you
beat
the
shit
out
me
[with
Chorus]
And
no
matter
how
much
Too
much
is
never
enough
Maybe
cuz
were
crazy
in
loooove
[Chorus]
Im
crazy
on
you
Crazy
on
you
Let
me
go
crazy
crazy
on
youuuuuuuuu

[Intro]
I
told
yall
mothafuckas

Sleepin

Still

The

no

too
small
People

three
thousand
and
some
odd
vans
And
some
cum
wad
from

the
parkin
lot
Get
into
an
argument
over
a
parkin
spot
He
decides
to
pull
his
gun
out
and
lets

few
of

Missed

Follow

[verse

Cuz
I

you

Good
cuz
youre
so
fuckin
beautiful
when

It
makes
me
wanna
just
take
you
and
just
throw
you
on
the
bed
and
fuck
you
like
I
dont
even
know

You
FUCK
other
people
and
I
FUCK
other
people
Youre
a
SLUT
but
im
equal
im
a
MUTT
were
both
evilin
our
ways
but
neither
one
of
us
would
ever
admit
it
Cuz
one
of
us
would
have
one
up
on
the
other
so
forget
it
We
can
make
accusations
people
spread
rumours
But
they
aint
got
proof
till
they
do
its
just
the
two
of
us
You
and
me
cuz
any
chick
can
say
that
shes
screwin
me
But
you
gotta
believe
it
to
a
degree
cuz
true
indeed
If
you
didnt
I
wouldnt
be
hittin
yeah
I
would
Cuz
the
sex
is
too
damn
good
if
I
ran
who
would
I
run
to
that
would
be
this
soft
and
warm
So
its
off
and
on
Usually
more
off
then
on
but
at
least
we
know
that
we
Share
this
common
bond
youre
the
only
one
I
can
fuck
without
a
condom
on
I
hope
the
only
reason
that
I
cope
Is
cuz
of
that
fact
and
I
can
bust
in
that
and
thats
why
[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me
I
just
love
you
more
You
dont
want
me
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers
you
throw
em
at
me
I
know
its
sad
but
its
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
[verse
3]
I
can
never
understand
it
thats
why
I
dont
try
From
junior
high
until
we
both
die
you
silly
hoe
why
must
we
try
Is
it
really
so
rough
that
we
must
always
call
each
others
Billy
Goats
Gruff
Try
to
pull
each
others
legs
until
the
other
begs
Were
lying
to
ourself
thats
the
beauty
of
it
yeah
Cuz
we
truly
love
each
other
thats
why
we
always
fight
And
all
we
do
is
shove
each
other
every
other
fuckin
night
And
its
clear
it
aint
gonna
change
this
pinned
up
rage
We
both
have
we
both
feel
like
weve
been
upstaged
By
someone
else
we
both
been
someone
elses
someone
else
The
problem
is
neither
one
wants
help
its
an
addiction
And
it
cant
be
fixed
our
familys
mixed
up
Theres
a
baby
sister
in
the
mix
and
it
hurts
cuz
the
pieces
to
the
puzzle
dont
fit
And
anybody
who
thinks
he
knows
us
doesnt
know
shit
And
theyre
probably
just
tired
of
hearing
it
all
the
time
on
every
song
Every
lyric
and
every
rhyme
all
the
hoopla
all
of
the
woopty
woo
What
you
put
me
through
fuckin
woopty
do
But
I
wont
be
made
a
fool
of
if
this
is
true
love
You
wouldnt
do
what
you
did
last
time
you
wouldnt
screw
up
This
time
cuz
this
time
girl
im
tellin
you
what
You
do
it
again
and
im
fuckin
you
up
cuz
no
matter
[chorus
2]
What
you
say
what
you
do
Ima
hunt
you
down
till
I
find
you
No
matter
where
you
run
ill
be
right
there
Right
behind
you
in
your
nightmares
So
much
for
them
flowers
and
the
candy
All
the
times
that
you
threw
it
back
at
me
Told
me
you
hate
me
you
gon
hate
me
more
When
you
find
out
you
cant
escape
me
whore
[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say

me
I

You
dont
want
me
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers
you
throw
em
at
me
I
know
its
sad
but
its
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
Once
you
call
my
name
out
things
will
never
be
the
same
They
should
have
never
let
us
get
off
foot
in
this
game
Ever
since
I
was
introduced
to
rap
music
I
been
missin
a
screw
like
Bishop
and
Juice
I
could
lose
it
at
any
moment
Those
who
know
me
know
it
So
they
probaly
told
you
go
with
the
flow
Just
so
that
I
dont
explode
And
have
another
episode
where
I
let
it
go
as
far
as
The
one
with
Benzino
did
Im
waitin
for
that
next
beef
Im
cocked
locked
and
loaded
Im
ready
to
go
so
bad
Im
goin
bananas
My
dicks
so
hard
Anna
Nicole
could
use
it
to
fuckin
pole
vault
with
Oh
shit
I
mean
when
she
was
still
bloated
Before
they
cut
her
stomach
open
and
lipoed
it
Anybody
I
throw
flames
at
gets
a
name
its
a
game
Cause
they
know
that
they
dont
spit
the
same
Its
a
shame
what
people
do
for
10
minutes
of
fame
Everyday
its
the
same
thing
People
in
this
game
try
to
buddy
buddy
us
Just
to
get
close
enough
to
study
us
Everybody
just
wants
to
have
somethin
to
do
with
that
They
all
tryin
to
get
that
stamp
They
after
that
Shady
-
Aftermath
money
Its
like
a
monopoly
They
probaly
just
now
finally
understand
how
to
rob
fully
50
Cent
was
like
a
fuckin
jackpot
for
me
And
Dre
its
like
we
hit
the
fuckin
lottery
And
a
damn
slot
machine
at
the
same
time
as
eachother
Why
the
fuck
you
think
we
ride
like
we
brothers
When
we
rhyme
with
eachother
In
time
we
discovered
that
we
have
more
in
common
Then
we
thought
with
eachother
Both
robbed
of
our
mothers
Our
fathers
aint
want
us
What
was
wrong
with
us
was
it
our
fault
Cause
we
started
thinkin
god
doesnt
love
us
Two
odd
motheruckers
who
just
happened
to
meet
at
the
right
time
What
a
coincidence
cause
when
50

shot

in
Jamaica
Queens

Aiyyo

Just

back
with
this
pack
of
Zig
Zags
and
this
bag
of
this
weed
it
gives
me
the
shit
needed
to
be
the
most
meanest
MC
on
this
--
on
this
Earth
And
since
birth
Ive
been
cursed
with
this
curse
to
just
curse
And
just
blurt
this
berserk
and
bizarre
shit
that
works
And
it
sells
and
it
helps
in
itself
to
relieve
all
this
tension
dispensin
these
sentences
Gettin
this
stress
thats
been
eatin
me
recently
off
of
this
chest
and
I
rest
again
peacefully
peacefully
but
at
least
have
the
decency
in
you
to
leave
me
alone
when
you
freaks
see
me
out
in
the
streets
when
Im
eatin
or
feedin
my
daughter
to
not
come
and
speak
to
me
speak
to
me
I
dont
know
you
and
no
I
dont
owe
you
a
mo-therfuck-in
thing
Im
not
Mr
NSync
Im
not
what
your
friends
think
Im
not
Mr
Friendly
I
can
be
a
prick
if
you
tempt
me
my
tank
is
on
empty
is
on
empty
No
patience
is
in
me
and
if
you
offend
me
Im
liftin
you
10
feet
liftin
you
10
feet
in
the
air
I
dont
care
who
is
there
and
who
saw
me
destroy
you
Go
call
you
a
lawyer
file
you
a
lawsuit
Ill
smile
in
the
courtroom
and
buy
you
a
wardrobe
Im
tired
of
all
you
of
all
you
I
dont
mean
to
be
mean
but
thats
all
I
can
be
is
just
me
Chorus:
Eminem
And
I
am
whatever
you
say
I
am
If
I
wasnt
then
why
would
I
say
I
am
In
the
paper
the
news
everyday
I
am
Radio
wont
even
play
my
jam
Cause
I
am
whatever
you

If
I
wasnt

why
would
I
say
I
am
In
the
paper
the

everyday
I

I
dont
know
its
just
the
way
I
am
[Eminem]
Sometimes
I
just
feel
like
my
father
I
hate
to
be
bothered
with
all
of
this
nonsense
its
constant
And
Oh
its
his
lyrical
content
-
-
the
song
Guilty
Conscience
has
gotten
such
rotten
responses
And
all
of
this
controversy
circles
me
and
it
seems
like
the
media
immediately
points
a
finger
at
me
finger
at
me
So
I
point
one
back
at
em
but
not
the
index
or
pinkie
or
the
ring
or
the
thumb
its
the
one
you
put
up
when
you
dont
give
a
fuck
when
you
wont
just
put
up
with
the
bullshit
they
pull
cause
they
full
of
shit
too
When
a
dudes
gettin
bullied
and
shoots
up
his
school
and
they
blame
it
on
Marilyn
on
Marilyn
and
the
heroin
Where
were
the
parents
at
And
look
where
its
at
Middle
America
now
its
a
tragedy
Now
its
so
sad
to
see
an
upper
class
ci-ty
havin
this
happenin
this
happenin
then
attack
Eminem
cause
I
rap
this
way
rap

way
But
Im
glad
cause
they
feed
me
the
fuel
that
I
need
for
the
fire
to
burn
and
its
burnin
and
I
have
returned
Chorus
[Eminem]
Im
so
sick
and
tired
of

that
I
would
just
die
or
get
fired
and
dropped
from
my
label
and
stop
with
the
fables
Im
not
gonna
be
able
to

My

This
is
Stan
My
teas
gone
cold
Im
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
cant
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
itll
all
be
gray
but
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
its
not
so
bad
its
not
so
bad
Dear
Slim
you
still
aint
called
or
wrote
I
hope
you
have
a
chance
I
aint
mad
-
I
just
think
its
FUCKED
UP
you
dont
answer
fans
If
you
didnt
wanna
talk
to
me
outside
your
concert
you
didnt
have
to
but
you
coulda
signed
an
autograph
for
Matthew
Thats
my
little
brother
man
hes
only
six
years
old
We
waited
in
the
blistering
cold
for
you
four
hours
and
you
just
said
No
Thats
pretty
shitty
man
-
youre
like
his
fuckin
idol
He
wants
to
be
just
like
you
man
he
likes
you
more
than
I
do
I
aint
that
mad
though
I
just
dont
like
being
lied
to
Remember
when
we
met
in
Denver
You
said
if
Id
write
you
you
would
write
back
See
Im
just
like
you
in
a
way
I
never
knew
my
father
neither
He
used
to
always
cheat
on
my
mom
and
beat
her
I
can
relate
to
what
youre
saying
in
your
songs
So
when
I
have
a
shitty
day
I
drift
away
and
put
em
on
Cause
I
dont
really
got
shit
else
So
that
shit
helps
when
Im
depressed
I
even
got
a
tattoo
of
your
name
across
the
chest
Sometimes
I
even
cut
myself
to
see
how
much
it
bleeds
Its
like
adrenaline
the
pain
is
such
a
sudden
rush
for
me
See
everything
you
say
is
real
And
I
respect
you
cause
you
tell
it
My
girlfriends
jealous
cause
I
talk
about
you
24/7
But
she
dont
know
you
like
I
know
you
Slim
no
one
does
She
dont
know
what
it
was
like
for
people
like
us
growin
up
You
gotta
call
me
man
Ill
be
the
biggest
fan
youll
ever
lose
sincerely
yours
Stan
PS
We
should
be
together
too

Hey

a
fifth
of

You

the
song
by
Phil
Collins
In

Air
of
the
Night
about
that
guy
who
couldve
saved
that
other
guy
from
drownin
But

then
Phil
saw
it
all
then
at
a
show
he
found
him
Thats
kinda
how
this
is
You
couldve
rescued
me
from
drowning
Now
its
too
late
Im
on
a
thousand
downers
now
Im
drowsy
And
all
I
wanted
was
a
lousy
letter
or
a
call
I
hope
you
know
I
ripped
all
of
your
pictures
off
the
wall
I
loved
you
Slim
we
couldve
been
together

think
about
it
You
ruined
it
now
I
hope
you
cant
sleep
and
you
dream
about
it
And
when
you
dream
I
hope
you
cant
sleep
and
you
scream
about
it
I
hope
your
conscience
eats
at
you
and
you
cant
breathe
without
me
See
Slim--shut
up
bitch
Im
tryin
to
talk
Hey

And

the
bridge
now
Oh

I
supposed
to

shit

My
teas
gone
cold
Im
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
cant
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
itll
all
be
gray
but
your

It
reminds

that
its
not

Dear

I
meant

sooner
but
I

busy
You

your
girlfriends

How
far
along
is
she
Look
Im
really
flattered
you
would
call
your
daughter
that
And
heres
an
autograph
for
your
brother
I
wrote
it
on
a
Starter
cap
Im
sorry
I
didnt
see
you
at
the
show
I
mustve
missed
you
Dont
think
I
did
that
shit
intentionally
just
to
diss
you
But
whats
this
shit
you
said
about
you
like
to
cut
your
wrists

I
say
that
shit
just
clowning
dawg
Come

how
fucked
up

You

issues
Stan
I
think
you
need
some
counselin
To
help
your
ass
from
bouncin
off
the
walls
When
you
get
down
some
And
whats
this
shit
about
us
meant
to
be
together
That
type
of
shitll
make
me
not
want
us
to
meet
each
other
I
really
think
you
and
your
girlfriend
need
each
other
Or
maybe
you
just
need
to
treat
her
better
I
hope
you
get
to
read
this
letter
I
just
hope
it
reaches
you
in
time
Before
you
hurt
yourself
I
think
that
youll
be
doing
just
fine
If
you
relax
a
little
Im
glad
I
inspire
you
But
Stan
why
are
you
so
mad
Try
to
understand
that
I
do
want
you
as
a
fan
I
just
dont
want
you
to
do
some
crazy
shit
I
seen
this
one
shit
on
the
news
a
couple
weeks
ago
that
made
me
sick
Some
dude
was
drunk
and
drove
his
car
over
a
bridge
And
had
his
girlfriend
in
the
trunk
And
she
was
pregnant
with
his
kid
And
in
the
car
they
found
a
tape
But
they
didnt
say
who
it
was
to
Come
to
think
about
it
his
name
was
it
was
you
damn
Look
if
you
had
one
shot
one
opportunity
To
seize
everything
you
ever
wanted-One
moment
Would
you
capture
it
or
just
let
it
slip
His
palms
are
sweaty
knees
weak
arms
are
heavy
Theres
vomit
on
his
sweater
already
moms
spaghetti
Hes
nervous
but
on
the
surface
he
looks
calm
and
ready
To
drop
bombs
but
he
keeps
on
forgettin
What
he
wrote
down
the
whole
crowd
goes
so
loud
He
opens
his
mouth
but
the
words
wont
come
out
Hes
chokin
how
everybodys
jokin
now
The
clocks
run
out
times
up
over
bloah
Snap
back
to
reality
Oh
there
goes
gravity
Oh
there
goes
Rabbit
he
choked
Hes
so
mad
but
he
wont
give
up
that
Easy
no
He
wont
have
it

he
knows
his
whole
backs
to
these
ropes
It
dont
matter
hes
dope
He
knows
that
but
hes
broke
Hes
so
stacked
that
he
knows
When
he
goes
back
to
his
mobile
home
thats
when
its
Back
to
the
lab
again
yo
This
whole
rap
shit
He
better
go
capture
this
moment
and
hope
it
dont
pass
him
You
better
lose
yourself
in
the
music
the
moment
You
own
it
you
better
never
let
it
go
You
only
get
one
shot

not
miss
your
chance
to
blow

A

It

grows
harder
only
grows
hotter
He
blows
us
all
over
these
hoes
is
all
on
him
Coast
to
coast
shows
hes
know
as
the
globetrotter
Lonely
roads
God
only
knows
Hes
grown
farther
from
home
hes
no
father
He
goes
home
and
barely
knows
his
own
daughter
But
hold
your
nose
cuz
here
goes
the
cold
water
His
hoes
dont
want
him
no
mo
hes
cold
product
They
moved
on

the
next
schmoe

He

Eminem]
There

floor
Bumpin

The

pole
I

God

[Eminem
makes
noises]
I
aint

Coming

And

These
ideas
are
nightmares
to
white
parents
Whose
worst
fear
is
a
child
with
dyed
hair
and
who
likes
earrings
Like
whatever
they
say
has
no
bearing
Its
so
scary
in
a
house
that
allows
no
swearing
To
see
him
walking
around
with
his
headphones
blaring
Alone
in
his
own
zone
cold
and
he
dont
care
Hes
a
problem
child
and
what
bothers
him
all
comes
out
When
he
talks
about
his
fucking
dad
walking
out
Cause
he
hates
him
so
bad
that
he
blocks
him
out
If
he
ever
saw
him
again
hed
probably
knock
him
out
His
thoughts
are
wacked
hes
mad
so
hes
talking
back
Talking
black
brainwashed
from
rock
and
rap
He
sags
his
pants
doo-rags
and
a
stocking
cap
His
step-father
hit
him
so
he
socked
him
back
And
broke
his
nose
his
house
is
a
broken
home
Theres
no
control
he
just
lets
his
emotions
go
Sing
with
me
sing
for
the
year
sing
it
Sing
for
the
laughter
sing
for
the
tear
Come
on
Sing
it
with
me
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
Entertainment
is
changing
intertwining
with
gangsters
In
the
land
of
the
killers
a
sinners
mind
is
a
sanctum
Holy
or
unholy
only
have
one
homie
Only
this
gun
lonely
cause
dont
anyone
know
me
Yet
everybody
just
feels
like
they
can
relate
I
guess
words
are
a
mothafucka
they
can
be
great
Or
they
can
degrade
or
even
worse
they
can
teach
hate
Its
like
these
kids
hang
on
every
single
statement
we
make
Like
they
worship
us
plus
all
the
stores
ship
us
platinum
Now
how
the
fuck
did
this
metamorphosis
happen
From
standing
on
corners
and
porches
just
rapping
To
having
a
fortune
no
more
kissing
ass
But
then
these
critics
crucify
you
journalists
try
to
burn
you
Fans
turn
on
you
attorneys
all
want
a
turn
at
you
To
get
they
hands
on
every
dime
you
have
They
want
you
to
lose
your
mind
every
time
you
mad
So
they
can
try
to
make
you
out
to
look
like
a
loose
cannon
Any
dispute
wont
hesitate
to
produce
handguns
Thats
why
these
prosecutors
wanna
convict
me
Strictly
just
to
get
me
off
of
these
streets
quickly
But
all
their
kids
been
listening
to
me
religiously
So
Im
signing
CDs
while
police
fingerprint
me
Theyre
for
the
judges
daughter
but
his
grudge
is
against
me
If
Im
such
a
fucking
menace
this
shit
doesnt
make
sense
B
Its
all
political
if
my
music
is
literal
Then
Im
a
criminal
how
the
fuck
can
I
raise
a
little
girl
I
couldnt
I
wouldnt
be
fit
to
Youre
full
of
shit
too
Guerrera
that
was
a
fist
that
hit
you
Sing
with
me
sing
for
the
year
sing
it
Sing
for
the
laughter
sing
for
the
tear
sing
this
shit
Sing
it
with
me
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
They
say
music
can
alter
moods
and
talk
to
you
Well
can
it
load
a
gun
up
for
you
and
cock
it
too
Well
if
it
can
and
the
next
time
you
assault
a
dude
Just
tell
the
judge
it
was
my
fault
and
Ill
get
sued
See
what
these
kids
do
is
hear
bout
us
toting
pistols
And
they
wanna
get
one
cause
they
think
the
shits
cool
Not
knowing
we
really
just
protecting
ourselves
We
entertainers
of
course
the
shits
affecting
our
sales
You
ignoramus
but
music
is
reflection
of
self
We
just
explain
it
and
then
we
get
our
checks
in
the
mail
Its
fucked
up
aint
it
How
we
can
come
from
practically
nothing
To
being
able
to
have
any
fucking
thing
that
we
wanted
Thats
why
we
sing
for
these
kids
who
dont
have
a
thing
Except
for
a
dream
and
a
fucking
rap
magazine
Who
post
pin-up
pictures
on
they
walls
all
day
long
Idolize
their
favorite
rappers
and
know
all
their
songs
Or
for
anyone
whos
ever
been
through
shit
in
they
lives
So
they
sit
and
they
cry
at
night
wishing
theyd
die
til
they
throw
on
a
rap
record
and
they
sit
and
they
vibe
Were
nothing
to
you
but
were
the
fucking
shit
in
their
eyes
Thats
why
we
seize
the
moment
try
to
freeze
it
and
own
it
Squeeze
it
and
hold
it
cause
we
consider
these
minutes
golden
And
maybe
theyll
admit
it
when
were
gone
Just
let
our
spirits
live
on
Through
our
lyrics
that
you
hear
in
our
songs
and
we
can
Sing
with
me
sing
for
the
year
sing
it
Sing
for
the
laughter
sing
for
the
tear
Come
on
Sing
it
with
me
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
Sing
with
me
sing
for
the
year
sing
it
Sing
for
the
laughter
sing
for
the
tear
Come
on
Sing
it
with
me
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow
the
good

you
away

So

Chorus:
Now

for

So

Cuz
we
need
a
little
controversy
Cuz
it
feels
so
empty
without

for

So
everybody
just
follow
me
Cuz
we
need
a
little
controversy
Cuz
it
feels
so
empty
without
me
Little
hellions
kids
feelin
rebellious
Embarrassed
their
parents
still
listen
to
Elvis
They
start
feelin
like
prisoners
helpless
Til
someone
comes
along
on
a
mission
and
yells
BITCH
A
visionary
vision
is
scary
could
start
a
revolution
Pollutin
the
air
waves
A
rebel
So
let
me
just
revel
and
bask
In
the
fact
that
I
got
everyone
kissin
my
ass
And
its
a
disaster
such
a
catastrophe
For
you
to
see
so
damn
much
of
my
ass
you
asked
for
me
Well
Im
back
Da
Na
Na
Na

fix
your
bent
antenna
Tune
it
in
and
then
Im
gonna
enter
Into
the
front
of
your
skin
like
a
splinter
The
center
of
attention
back
for
the
winter
Im
interesting
the
best
thing
since
wrestling
Infesting
in
your
kids
ears
and
nesting
Testing:
Attention
Please
Feel
the
tension
soon
as
someone
mentions
me
Heres

Chris

kicked
Worse

little
Limp
Bizkit
bastards
And
Moby
you
can
get
stoned
by
Obie
You
36
year-old
bald-headed
fag
blow
me
You
dont
know
me
youre
too
old
Let
go
its
over
nobody
listens
to
techno
Now
lets
go
just
give
me
the
signal
Ill
be
there
with
a
whole
list
full
of
new
insults
I
been
dope
suspenseful
with
a
pencil
Ever
since
Prince
turned
himself
into
a
symbol
knife
scrapes
But
sometimes
the
shit
just
seems
Everybody
only
wants
to
discuss
me
So
this
must
mean
Im
disgusting
But
its
just
me
Im
just
obscene
Though
Im
not
the
first
king
of
controversy
I
am
the
worst
thing
since
Elvis
Presley
To
do
Black
music
so
selfishly
And
use
it
to
get
myself
wealthy
Hey
Theres
a
concept
that
works
20
million
other
white
rappers
emerge
But
no
matta
how
many
fish
in
the
sea
Itll
be
so
empty
without
me

Kids
Step
by
step
heart
to
heart
left
right
left
we
all
fall
down
Step
by
step
heart
to
heart
Left
right
left
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
Im
supposed
to
be
the
soldier
Who
never
blows
his
composure
Even
though
I
hold
the
weight
of
the
whole
world
on
my
shoulders
I
aint
never
supposed
to
show
it
My
crew
aint
supposed
to
know
it
Even
if
it
means
going
toe
to
toe
with
a
Benzino
It
dont
matter
Id
never
drag
them
in
battles
that
I
can
handle
Less
I
absolutely
have
to
Im
supposed
to
set
an
example
I
need
to
be
the
leader
my
crew
looks
for
me
to
guide
em
If
some
shit
ever
does
pop
off
Im
supposed
to
be
beside
em
That
Ja
shit
I
tried
to
squash
it
It
was
too
late
to
stop
it
Theres
a
certain
line
you
just
dont
cross
and
he
crossed
it
I
heard
him
say
Hailies
name
on
a
song
And
I
just
lost
it
it
was
crazy
The
shit
went
way
beyond
some
Jay
Z
and
Nas
shit
And
even
though
the
battle
is
won
I
feel
like
we
lost
it
I
spent
so
much
energy
on
it
honestly
Im
exhausted
And
Im
so
caught
in
it
I
almost
feel
Im
the
one
who
caused
it
This
aint
what
Im
in
hip
hop
for
its
not
why
I
got
in
it
That
was
never
my
object
for
someone
to
get
killed
Why
would
I
want
to
destroy
something
I
helped
build
It
wasnt
my
intentions
my
intentions
were
good
I
went
through
my
whole
career
without
ever
mentioning
And
that
was
just
outta
respect
for
not
running
my
mouth
And
talking
about
something
that
I
knew
nothing
about
Plus
Dre
told
me
stay
out
this
just
wasnt
my
beef
So
I
did
I
just
fell
back
watched
and
gritted
my
teeth
While
hes
all
over
TV
Down-talking
the
man
who
literally
saved
my
life
Like
fuck
it
I
understand
This
is
business
and
this
shit
just
isnt
none
of
my
business
Im
still
knowing
this
shit
could
pop
off
at
any
minute
cause
Step
by
step
heart
to
heart
Left
right
left
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
There
used
to
be
a
time
when
you
could
just
say
a
rhyme
and
Wouldnt
have
to
worry
about
one
of
your
people
dyin
But
now
its
elevated
Cause
once
you
put
someones
kids
in
it
The
shit
gets
escalated
it
aint
just
words
no
more
is
it
Its
a
different
ball
game
You
call
names
and
you
aint
just
rappin
We
actually
tried
to
stop
the
50
and
Ja
beef
from
happenin
Me
and
Dre
had
sat
with
him
Kicked
it
and
had
a
chat
with
him
And
asked
him
not
to
start
it
he
wasnt
gonna
go
after
him
Until
Ja
started
yappin
in
magazines
how
he
stabbed
him
Fuck
it
50
smash
him
Mash
him
and
let
him
have
it
Meanwhile
my
attentions
pulled
in
another
direction
Some
receptionist
at
the
Source
Who
answers
phones
at
his
desk
Has
an
erection
for
me
and
thinks
that
Ill
be
his
resurrection
Tries
to
blow
the
dust
off
his
mic
and
make
a
new
record
But
now
hes
fucked
the
game
up
cause
one
of
the
ways
I
came
up
Was
through
that
publication
The
same
one
that
made
me
famous
Now
the
owner
of
it
has
got
a
grudge
against
me
for
nothin
Well
fuck
it
that
mothafucka
could
get
it
too
fuck
him
then
But
Im
so
busy
being
pissed
off
I
dont
stop
to
think
That
we
just
inherited
50s
beef
with
Murder
Inc
And
hes
inherited
mine
which
is
fine
Aint
like
either
of
us
mind
We
still
have
soldiers
thats
on
the
front
line
Thats
willing
to
die
for
us
as
soon
as
we
give
the
orders
Never
to
extort
us
strictly
to
show
they
support
us
And
maybe
shout
em
out
in
a
rap
or
up
in
the
chorus
To
show
em
we
love
em
back
And
let
them
know
how
important
it
is
To
have
Runyon
Avenue
soldiers
up
in
our
corners
Their
loyalty
to
us
is
worth
more
than
any
award
is
But
I
aint
tryin
to
have
none
of
my
people
hurt
or
murdered
It
aint
worth
it
I
cant
think
of
a
perfecter
way
to
word
it
Than
to
just
say
that
I
love
yall
too
much
to
see
the
verdict
Ill
walk
away
from
it
all
fore
I
let
it
go
any
further
But
dont
get
it
twisted
its
not
a
plea
that
Im
coppin
Im
just
willing
to
be
the
bigger
man
if
yall
can
quit
poppin
Off
at
your
jaws
well
then
I
can
Cause
frankly
Im
sick
of
talkin
Im
not
going
to
let
someone
elses
coffin
rest
on
my
conscience
cause
Step
by
step
heart
to
heart
Left
right
left
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
May
I
have
your
attention
please

your
attention

up
in
my
head
loose
But
no
worse
than
whats
going
on
in
your
parents
bedrooms
Sometimes
I
wanna
get
on
TV
and
just
let
loose
but
cant
But
its
cool
for
Tom
Green
to
hump
a
dead
moose
My
bum
is
on
your
lips
my
bum
is
on
your
lips
And
if
Im
lucky
you
might
just
give
it
a
little
kiss
And
thats
the
message
that
we
deliver
to
little
kids
And
expect
them
not
to
know
what
a
womans
clitoris
is
Of
course
they
gonna
know
what
intercourse
is
By
the
time
they
hit
fourth
grade
They
got
the
Discovery
Channel
dont
they
We
aint
nothing
but
mammals
Well
some
of
us
cannibals
Who
cut
other
people
open
like
cantaloupes
But
if
we
can
hump
dead
animals
and
antelopes
Then
theres
no
reason
that
a
man
and
another
man
cant
elope
But
if
you
feel
like
I
feel
I
got
the
anecdote
Women

panty-hoes

goes

Fuck

Yeah
I

not
always
make
sense
to
you
right
now
But
hey
what
daddy
always
tell
you
Straighten
up
little
soldier
Stiffen
up
that
upper
lip
What
you
crying
about
You
got
me
Hailie
I
know
you
miss
your
mom
and
I
know
you
miss
your
dad
When
Im
gone
but
Im
trying
to
give
you
the
life
that
I
never
had
I
can
see
youre
sad
even
when
you
smile
even
when
you
laugh
I
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
deep
inside
you
want
to
cry
Cuz
youre
scared
I
aint
there
Daddys
with
you
in
your
prayers
No
more
crying
wipe
them
tears
Daddys
here
no
more
nightmares
We
gon
pull
together
through
it
we
gon
do
it
Laney
uncles
crazy
aint
he
Yeah
but
he
loves
you
girl
and
you
better
know
it
Were
all
we
got
in
this
world
When
it
spins
when
it
swirls
When
it
whirls
when
it
twirls
Two
little
beautiful
girls
Lookin
puzzled
in
a
daze
I
know
its
confusing
you
Daddys
always
on
the
move
mammas
always
on
the
news
I
try
to
keep
you
sheltered
from
it
but
somehow
it
seems
The
harder
that
I
try
to
do
that
the
more
it
backfires
on
me
All
the
things
growing
up
his
daddy
that
he
had
to
see
Daddy
dont
want
you
to
see
but
you
see
just
as
much
as
he
did
We
did
not
plan
it
to
be
this
way
your
mother
and
me
But
things
have
gotten
so
bad
between
us
I
dont
see
us
ever
being
together
ever
again
Like
we
used
to
be
when
we
was
teenagers
But
then
of
course
everything
always
happens
for
a
reason
I
guess
it
was
never
meant
to
be
But
its
just
something
we
have
no
control
over
and
thats
what
destiny
is
But
no
more
worries
rest
your
head
and
go
to
sleep
Maybe
one
day
well
wake
up
and
this
will
all
just
be
a
dream
Now
hush
little
baby
dont
you
cry
Everythings
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up
little
lady
I
told
ya
Daddys
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
mommys
not
here
right
now
and
we
dont
know
why
We
feel
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy
pretty
baby
But
I
promise
mommas
gon
be
alright
Its
funny
I
remember
back
one
year
when
daddy
had
no
money
Mommy
wrapped
the
Christmas
presents
up
And
stuck
em
under
the
tree
and
said
some
of
em
were
from
me
Cuz
daddy
couldnt
buy
em
Ill
never
forget
that
Christmas
I
sat
up
the
whole
night
crying
Cuz
daddy
felt
like
a
bum
see
daddy
had
a
job
But
his
job
was
to
keep
the
food
on
the
table
for
you
and
mom
And
at
the
time
every
house
that
we
lived
in
Either
kept
getting
broken
into
and
robbed
Or
shot
up
on
the
block
and
your
mom
was
saving
money
for
you
in
a
jar
Tryna
start
a
piggy
bank
for
you
so
you
could
go
to
college
Almost
had
a
thousand
dollars
till
someone
broke
in
and
stole
it
And
I
know
it
hurt
so
bad
it
broke
your
mommas
heart
And
it
seemed
like
everything
was
just
startin
to
fall
apart
Mom
and
dad
was
arguin
a
lot
so
momma
moved
back
On
the
Chalmers
in
the
flat
one
bedroom
apartment
And
dad
moved
back
to
the
other
side
of
8
Mile
on
Novara
And
thats
when
daddy
went
to
California
with
his
CD
and
met
Dr
Dre
And
flew
you
and
momma
out
to
see
me
But
daddy
had
to
work
you
and
momma
had
to
leave
me
Then
you
started
seeing
daddy
on
the
TV
and
momma
didnt
like
it
And
you
and
Laney
were
to
young
to
understand
it
Papa
was
a
rollin
stone
momma
developed
a
habit
And
it
all
happened
too
fast
for
either
one
of
us
to
grab
it
Im
just
sorry
you
were
there
and
had
to
witness
it
first
hand
Cuz
all
I
ever
wanted
to
do
was
just
make
you
proud
Now
Im
sittin
in
this
empty
house
just
reminiscing
Lookin
at
your
baby
pictures

out
To
see

much
you

have
grown
its
almost
like

leavin
her
side
even
if
I
hated
Kim
I
grit
my
teeth
and
Id
try
to
make
it
work
with
her
at
least
for
Hailies
sake
I
maybe
made
some
mistakes
but
im
only
human
but
im
man
enough
to
face
them
today
what
I
did
was
stupid
no
doubt
it
was
dumb
but
the
smartest
shit
I
did
was
take
them
bullets
out
of
that
gun
cause
ida
killed
em
shit
I
would
have
shot
Kim
and
him
both
its
my
life
id
like
to
welcome
yall
to
the
Eminem
show
[CHORUS]
Now
I
would
never
diss
my
own
mama
just
to
get
recognition
take
a
second
to
listen
who
you
think
this
record
is
dissin
but
put
yourself
in
my
position
just
try
to
envision
witnessin
your
Mama
poppin
prescription
pills
in
the
kitchen
bitchin
that
someones
always
goin
through
her
purse
and
shits
missin
going
through
public
housing
systems
victim
of
Munchausens
syndrome
my
whole
life
I
was
made
to
believe
I
was
sick
when
I
wasnt
til
I
grew
up
now
I
blew
up
it
makes
you
sick
to
ya
stomach
doesnt
it
wasnt
it
the
reason
you
made
that
Cd
for
me
ma
so
you
could
try
to
justify
the
way
you
treated
me
ma
but
guess
what
your
gettin
older
now
and
its
cold
when
your
lonely
and
Nathans
growing
up
so
quick
hes
gonna
know
that
your
phoney
and
Hailies
getting
so
big
now
you
should
see
her
shes
beautiful
but
youll
never
see
her
she
wont
even
be
at
your
funeral
see
what
hurts
me
the
most
is
you
wont
admit
you
was
wrong
bitch
do
your
song
keep
tellin
yourself
that
you
was
a
mom
but
how
dare
you
try
to
take
what
you
didnt
help
me
to
get
you
selfish
bitch
I
hope

fuckin
burn
in
hell
for
this
shit

post
office
or

Sometimes

when
I
jot
em
but
anyways
fuck

whats
been
up
Man

If

a
daughter
guess

Ima

her
Ima
name

Bonnie
I
read
about
your
Uncle
Ronnie
too
Im
sorry
I
had
a
friend
kill
himself
over
some
bitch
who
didnt
want
him
I
know
you
probably
hear
this
everyday
but
Im
your
biggest
fan
I
even
got
the
underground
shit
that
you
did
with
Scam
I
got
a
room
full
of
your
posters
and
your
pictures

the
shit
you

Ruckus
too

Anyways
I

man
hit

back
just
to
chat
truly
yours
your
biggest
fan
This
is
Stan
My
teas
gone
cold
Im
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
cant
see
at

Dear
Slim
you
still
aint
called
or
wrote
I
hope
you
have
a
chance
I
aint
mad
-
I
just
think
its
FUCKED
UP
you
dont
answer
fans
If
you
didnt
wanna
talk
to
me
outside
your
concert
you
didnt
have
to
but
you
coulda
signed
an
autograph
for
Matthew
Thats
my
little
brother
man
hes
only
six
years
old
We
waited
in
the
blistering
cold
for
you
four
hours
and
you
just
said
No
Thats
pretty
shitty
man
-
youre
like
his
fuckin
idol
He
wants
to
be
just
like
you
man
he
likes
you
more
than
I
do
I
aint
that
mad
though
I
just
dont
like
being
lied
to
Remember
when
we
met
in
Denver
You
said
if
Id
write
you
you
would
write
back
See
Im
just
like
you
in
a
way
I
never
knew
my
father
neither
He
used
to
always
cheat
on
my
mom
and
beat
her
I
can
relate
to
what
youre
saying
in
your
songs
So
when
I
have
a
shitty
day
I
drift
away
and
put
em
on
Cause
I
dont
really
got
shit
else
So
that
shit
helps
when
Im
depressed
I
even
got
a
tattoo
of
your
name
across
the
chest
Sometimes
I
even
cut
myself
to
see
how
much
it
bleeds
Its
like
adrenaline
the
pain
is
such
a
sudden
rush
for
me
See
everything
you
say
is
real
And
I
respect
you
cause
you
tell
it
My
girlfriends
jealous
cause
I
talk
about
you
24/7
But
she
dont
know
you
like
I
know
you
Slim
no
one
does
She
dont
know
what
it
was
like
for
people
like
us
growin
up
You
gotta
call
me
man
Ill
be
the
biggest
fan
youll
ever
lose
sincerely
yours
Stan
PS
We
should
be
together
too

Hey

You

the
song
by
Phil
Collins
In

Air
of
the
Night
about
that
guy
who
couldve
saved
that
other
guy
from
drownin
But

then
Phil
saw
it
all
then
at
a
show
he
found
him
Thats
kinda
how
this
is
You
couldve
rescued
me
from
drowning
Now
its
too
late
Im
on
a
thousand
downers
now
Im
drowsy
And
all
I
wanted
was
a
lousy
letter
or
a
call
I
hope
you
know
I
ripped
all
of
your
pictures
off
the
wall
I
loved
you
Slim
we
couldve
been
together

think
about
it
You
ruined
it
now
I
hope
you
cant
sleep
and
you
dream
about
it
And
when
you
dream
I
hope
you
cant
sleep
and
you
scream
about
it
I
hope
your
conscience
eats
at
you
and
you
cant
breathe
without
me
See
Slim--shut

bitch
Im
tryin
to
talk
Hey

her
throat
I

My

why
I
got
out
of
bed
at

The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
cant

And
even

but
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
its
not

Dear

busy
You

your

that
And
heres
an
autograph
for
your
brother
I
wrote
it
on
a
Starter
cap
Im
sorry
I
didnt
see
you

the
show
I
mustve
missed
you
Dont
think
I
did
that
shit
intentionally
just
to
diss
you
But

this
shit
you
said
about

clowning
dawg
Come

you

some
counselin
To
help
your
ass
from
bouncin
off
the
walls
When
you
get
down
some
And
whats
this
shit
about

to
be
together
That
type
of
shitll
make
me
not
want
us
to
meet
each
other
I
really
think
you
and
your
girlfriend
need
each
other
Or
maybe
you
just
need
to
treat
her
better
I
hope
you
get
to
read
this
letter
I
just
hope
it
reaches
you
in
time
Before
you
hurt
yourself
I
think
that
youll
be
doing
just
fine
If
you
relax
a
little
Im
glad
I
inspire
you
But
Stan
why
are
you
so
mad

I

So

I

Hillary

drink
And

like
it

still
legal
Im
dumb
enough
to
walk
in
a

So
Im
dumb
enough
to
ask
for
a

with
Lauryn
Hill
Some
people

ignorin
skill
Cause
I
stand
out

bill
But
I

through
the

How
the

I
dont
even
exist
I
get
a

bathe
go
to
a

Die
from

Jumped

minutes
late
Mother
are
you
there
I
love
you
I
never
meant

to
my
brain
that
I
just
severed
a
main
vein
with
a
chainsaw
and
Im
in
pain
I
take
a
breather
and
sighed
either
Im
high

Im
nuts
Cause

I
So
when
you
see
your

thermometer
shoved

Motherfuckers

Do

See
Im
influenced
by
the
ghetto
you
ruined
That

dude
you
gave
nothing
I
made
something
doing
What
I
do
through
and
through
and
I
gave
you
the
news
with
a
twist
its
just
his
ghetto
point
of
view
The
renegade
you
been
afraid
I
penetrate
pop
culture
bring
em
a
lot
closer
to
the
block
where

Got

Knocked

Ill

round
hiding
down
duckin
strays
from
frustrated
youths
stuck
in

ways
Just
read
a
magazine
that
fucked
up
my
day
How
you
rate

that
thugs
with
nothing
relate
to
it
I
help
them
see
they
way
through
it
not

Cant

Bet

Verse]
Since
Im

position
to
talk
to

I

Cause

and
if

Ill

But
if

dont
then
yall
swallow
the
truth
grin
and
bear

Now
whos

king
of
these
rude
ludicrous
lucrative
lyrics
Who
could
inherit

put
the

in
hysterics
Using

But
theres
a
huge
interference
theyre
sayin
you
shouldnt
hear
it
Maybe
its
hatred
I
spew
maybe
its
food
for
the
spirit
Maybe
its
beautiful
music
I
made
for
you
to
just
cherish
But
Im
debated
disputed
hated
and
viewed
in
America
as
a
motherfuckin
drug
addict
like
you
didnt
experiment
Now
now
thats
when
you
start
to
stare
at
whos
in
the
mirror
and
see
yourself
as
a
kid
again
and
you
get
embarrassed
And
I
got
nothing
to
do
but
make
you
look
stupid
as
parents
You
fuckin
do-gooders
-
too
bad
you
couldnt
DO-GOOD
at
marriage
And
do
you
have
any
clue
what
I
had
to
do
to
get

I
dont

you
do
so
stay
tuned

[Jay-Z:
Verse]
I
had
to
hustle
my
back
to
the
wall
ashy
knuckles
Pockets
filled
with
a
lot
of
lint
not
a
cent
Gotta
vent
lot
of
innocent
of
lives
lost
on
the
project
bench
What
you
hollarin
Gotta
pay
rent
bring
dollars
in
By
the
bodega
iron
under
my
coat
feelin
braver
Doo-rag
wrappin
my
waves
up
pockets
full
of
hope
Do
not
step
to
me
Im
awkward
I
box
leftier
often
My
pops
left
me
an
orphan
my
momma
wasnt
home
Could
not
stress
to
me
I
wasnt
growin
specially
on
nights
I
brought
something
home
to
quiet
the
stomach
rumblings
My
demeanor
thirty
years
my
senior
My
childhood
didnt
mean
much
only
raisin
greener
Raisin
my
fingers
to
critics
raisin
my
head
to
the
sky
Big
I
did
it
multii
before
I
die
nigga
No
lie
just
know
I
chose
my
own
fate
I
drove
by

fork
in
the
road
and
went

See
Im
a
poet
to
some
a
regular
modern
day
Shakespeare
Jesus
Christ
the
King
of
these
Latter

Saints
here
To
shatter
the
picture
in
which
of
that
as
they
paint
me
as
a
mother
of
hate
Satan
and
scatter-brained
atheist
But
that
aint
the
case
see
its
a
matter
of
taste
We
as
a
people
decide
if
Shadys
as
bad
as
they
say
he
is
Or
is
he
the
ladder
a
gateway
to
escape
Media
scapegoat
they
can
be
mad
at
today
See
its
as
easy
as
cake
simple
as
whistling
Dixie
while
Im
wavin
the
pistol
at
sixty
Christians
against
me
Go
to
war
with
the
Mormons
take
a
bath
with
the
Catholics
in
holy
water
no
wonder
they
try
to
hold
me
under

Im
a
motherfuckin
spiteful
delightful
eyeful
The
new
Ice
Cube
motherfuckers
hate
to
like
you
What
did
I
do
huh
Im
just
a

from

And
we
also
like
to
introduce
The
two
newest
members
of
the
family
One
goes
by
the
name
of
Bobby
Creek
The
other
goes
by
the
name
of
Ca$his
From
Orange
County
And
I
think
its
about
time
we
just
cut
the
bull
shit
::::EMINEM::::
Nothing
can
stop
and
nothing
can
change
and
you
better
just
make
new
livin
arrangments
if
you
think
you
the
top
and
king
of
the
castle
you
about
to
be
thrown
off
the
throne
and
ripped
a
new
asshole
all
I
hear
is
Im
the
best
at
this
and
Im
best
at
that
but
I
dont
hear
my
name
no

brought
up
in
rap
and
I
dont
usually
trip
or
damn
get
caught
up
in
that
but
when
they
say
one
of
the
best
Im
nowhere
thought
up
as
that
not
even
the
same
leage
as
Jay-Z
Nas
Pac
Biggie
or
maybe
the
name
me
somewhere
down
at
the
bottom
right
after
AZ
or
say
he
ripped
that
Biggie
verse
or
that
Jay-Z
yo
his
verses
were
crazy
on
that
Renegade
beat
but
I
aint
never
bought
no
whole
CD
of
shady
and
all
I
hear
is
pop
tunes
come
on
the
Radi-O
and
they
play
em
20
times
in
a
row
daily
and
they
very
well
maybe
the
same
reason
they
dont
say
me
when
they
speak
on
hip-hop
legends
which
is
amaze
me
cause
I
thought
the
formula
was
to
hit
mainstream
and
make
it
big
ba
big
big
bay
ba
baby
::::OBIE
TRICE::::
So
maybe
the
eighties
made
me
crazy
Ive
been
tryin
to
get
my
weight
up
since
the
ace
Slim
Shady
gave
me
the
gate
key
paved
the
way
so
lately
my
stakes
get
better
each

No

a
weeping
willow
I
cant
sleep
a
pain
so
deep

bellows
But
these
cellos
help
just
to
keep
me
mellow
Hands
on
my
head
touch
knees
to
elbows
Im
hunched
over
emotion
just
flows
over
These
cold
shoulders
are
both
frozen
You
dont
know
me
I
keep
saying
it
I
cant
stress
it
enough
So
keep
playing
it
and
stand
next
to
the
subs
I
choke
mics
like
asphyxiation
When
Im
strangling
my
own
throat
masturbatin
Fuck

Im
a
basket
case
and
I
master
this
rap
shit
til
my
ass
gets
wasted
Til
my
assassination
Til
Im
slain
because
of
some
fags
infatuation
44
mags
fascination
A
taste
for
disaster
and
if
thats
the

for

a

MC
Its
what

to

if
he
still
has
it
And
if
his
skills
mastered
Hes

to
spill
raps
long
after
hes
killed
Thats
a
real
MC
got
you
feelin
me
Whether
willing
or
unwillingly
you
still
agree
As
long
as
theres
still
this
hunger
and
will
in
me
Then
expect
a
longer
life
expectancy
Id
be
a
savage
beast
if
I
aint
had
this
outlet
to
salvage
me
Inside
Id
be
exploding
soaked
in
self-loathing
And
mourning
so
Im
warning
you
dont
coax
me
Its
silly
Im
really
a
sheep
in
wolfs
clothing
Who
only
reacts
when
he
gets
pushed
dont
be
Fooled
the
press
blows
up
this
whole
thing
Its
stupid
they
dont

cause

dont
see
That
Im
wounded
all

was
ballooned
it
Im
sick
of

tattoos
Cartoon

tuned
it
out
Im
sick
of
dukin
They
can
suck
my
dick
while
Im
pukin
And

can
Expect

sympathy
from
me
Im

Cold

Last
night
was
a

I
cant
quite

when
I
Had
that

Off
a
half
pint
of
the
jack
My

vic
and
a
half
A
flashlight
Up
kim
kardashians
ass
I
remember
the
first

I
dismembered
a
family
member
December
I
think
it
was
I
was
having
drinks
with
my
cuz
And
I
wrapped
him
In
christmas
lights
Pushed
him
into
the
stinkin
tub
Cut
him
up
into
pieces
Then
just
when
I
went
to
drink
his
Blood
I
thought
I
outta
drink
this
bath
water
That
outta
be
fun
Thats
when
my
days
of
serial
murder
man
slaughter
begun
The
sight
of
blood
excites
me
That
might
be
an
artery
son
Your
blood
curdling
screams
Just
dont
seem
to
bother
me
none
Its
3
am
And
here
I
come
So
you
should
probably
run
A
secret
passage
way
around
here
Man
theres
got
to
be
one
Oh
no
theres
probably
none
He
can
scream
all
that
he
wants
Top
of
his
lungs
It
aint
no
stoppin
me
from
choppin
him
upup
Chorus

[Verse
1:]
I
was
born
with
a
dick
in
my
brain
Yea
fucked
in
the
head
My
step-father
said
that
I
sucked
in
the
bed
Til
one
night
he
snuck
in
and
said
Were
going
out
back
I
want
my
dick
sucked
in
the
shed
Cant
we
just
play
with
Teddy
Ruxpin
instead

After
I
fuck
you
in
the
butt
get
some
head
Bust
a
nut
get
some
rest
The
next
day
my
mother
said
I
dont
know
what
the
fucks
up
with
this
kid
The
bastard
wont
even
eat
nothing
he
scared
He
just
hung
himself
in
the
bedroom
hes
dead
Terry
dont
let
that
fucker
get
you
upset
Go
in
there
stick
a
fucking
cigarette
to
his
neck
I
bet
you
hes
faking
it
I
bet
you
Ill
bet
he
prolly
wants
to
see
how
upset
you
would
get
Ill
go
handle
this
of
course
unless
you
object
Ah
go
fuck
his
brains
out
if
any
is
left
in
his
head
[Chorus:]
If
you
could
count
the
skeletons
in
my
closet
Under
my
bed
and
up
under
my
faucet
Then
you
would
know
Ive
completely
lost
it
Is
he
nuts
No
hes
insane
If
you
could
count
the
skeletons
in
my
closet
Under
my
bed
and
up
under
my
faucet
Then
you
would
know
Ive
completely
lost
it
Is
he
nuts
No
hes
insane
[Verse
2:]
You
get
it
No
I
just
tried
to
bite
my
face
off
I
just
got
fucking
chased
off
with
a
chainsaw
Then
he
took
the
chainsaw
bit
the
fucking
blades
off
Ate
the
blades
stuck
a
baseball
in
a
slingshot
Then
he
aimed
at
his
own
face
let
the
thing
pop
Took
his
eye
out
picked
it
up
and
played
ping
pong
Then
he
played
ping
pong
with
his
own
ding
dong
That
motherfuckers
got
nuts
like
king
kong
Then
he
set
the
lawn
mower
out
on
the
dang
lawn
And
he
layed
all
up
underneath
it
with
the
thing
on
Then
he
took
his
pants
he
took
every
fucking
thing
off
Everything
except
his
tank

You

that
chick
in
the
gym
checking
me
out
Any
second
Im
bout
to
stick
her
neck
in
my
mouth
I
lose
a
pill
and
Im
wrecklessly
wrecking
the
house
That
was
suppose
to
be
breakfast
where
the
heck
is
it
now
Heres
the
necklace
I
lost
right
next
to
Stephanies
blouse
Man
I
should
check
to
see
if
my
mom
left
any
out
Nope

Ill
re-route
Maybe
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
couch
Oh
Jackpot
Yea
Open
Sesame
mouth
Down
the
hatchet
the
feeling
you
cant
match
it
A
rap-tap-tap
on
your
door
with
the
damn
ratchet
A
tat-tac-tac
in
the
hall
with
the
damn
hatchet
A
nap-sack-packed
with
like
40-some
Zan-exs
Shorty
come

Im
tryin
to
score

some
lapdances
Im
bout
to
relapse
so
maybe
pour

some
Jack
Daniels
Formula
40-40
and
40s

mad
capsules
The

[Chorus
1:]
Well

bucks
for
these
Perc-odans
Busters
getting
to
be
where
he
lustfully
surged
it
in
Pain

hitting
his
knee
and
his
muscles
be
hurtin
him
Childishly
on
the
phone
tryin
to
rustle
up
muscle
relax-
-ers
for
his
back
and
a
couple
of
packs
Since
now
hes
doubling
back-wards
and
he
stumblin
back
Slipped
and
fell
hit
his
back-bone
heard
something
go
crack
Now
hes
up
in
the
bathroom
like
hes
busting
a
nap
Almost
ended
it
that
soon
because
of
the
fact
Im
just
busting
my
own
chops
while
Im
bustin
a
rap
Resuscitated
and
re-juiced
so
fuck

a
little
schoolgirl
when

Upon

that
the
world
was
hers
She
twirls
and
turns
and
flirts
in
skirts
so
bad
it
hurts
It
irked
me
and
made
me
mad

first
I
lashed

Was

a
crush

how
to
tell
it
to
her
Should

cut
off
one
of
my
ears
and

it
to
her
Send
her
pictures
of
my
collections
of
skeletons
Of

Let
the
boy
off
the
bench
coach
and
throw
it
to
him
There
he
goes
in
his
trench
coat
and
them
clothes
again
Baby
make
us
some
french
toast
and
show
us
some
skin
Ill
show
you
every
inch
girls
of
my
foreskin
Show

nipple
I
pinch

and
throw

ten
Now
you
know
its
a
sin
to
tease
blow
us
again
The
sorcerer
of
intercourse
if
its
forced
its
him
Dont
fight
the
feeling
if
youre
feeling
the
force
within
When
you
wake
in
the
morning
next
to
the
porcelain

Cause

Wont

to
smoke

Now

personal
for

Seeing

Youre

Im
admitting
Im
beginning
to

Like
I

Faced

I

Please

Be

How
many
people
you
know
can
name
every
serial
killer
who
ever
existed
in
a
row
Put
em
in
chronological
order
beginning
with
Jack
the
Ripper
Name
the
time
and
place
from
the
body
the
bag
the
zipper
Location
of
the
woods
where
the
body
was
dragged
and
then
dumped
The
trunk
that
they
were
stuffed
in
the
model
the
make
the
plate
And
which
motel
which
lake
they
found
her
in
And
how
they
attacked
the
victim
Say
which
murder
weapon
was
used
to
do
what
and
which
one
Which
night
it
was
done
what
kid
would
write
there
was
none
So
sloppy
like

It
must
be
the

Thats
creepin
upon

Capable

When

Good

[Verse
1:]
As
I
fall
deeper
into
a
manic
state
Im
a
prime
canidate
for
the
gene
to
recieve
the
drug
addict
traits
Blood
pressure
climbs
at
a
dramatic
rate
I
seem
to
gravitate
to
the
bottle
of
nyquil
then
I
salivate
Start
off
with
the
nyquil
like
I
think
Ill
just
have
a
taste
Couple
sips
of
that
then
I
gradually
graduate
Too
a
harder
perscription
drug
called
valium
like
ya
thats
great
I
go
to
take
just
one
and
I
end
up
like
having
eight
Now
I
need
something
in
my
stomach
cause
I
havent
ate
Maybe
Ill
grab
a
plate
of
nachos
and
Ill
have
a
steak
And
youd
think
with
all
I
have
at
stake
Look
at
my
daughters
face
Mommy
somethings
is
wrong
with
dad
I
think
Hes
acting
weird
again
hes
really
begining
to
scare
me
Wont
shave
his
beard
again
and
he
pretends
he
doesnt
hear
me
And
all
he
does
is
eat
dorritos
and
cheetos
And
he
just
fell
asleep
in
his
car
eating
three
musketeers
in
the
rear
seat
[Hook:]
Sometimes
I
feel
so
alone
I
just
dont
know
feels
like
I
been
down
this
road
before
So
lonely
and
cold
Its
like
something
takes
over
me
Soon
as
I
go
home
and
close
the
door
Kinda
feels
like
deja
vu
I
wanna
get
away
from
this
place
I
do
But
I
cant
and
I
wont
say
I
tried
but
I
know
thats
a
lie
cause
I
dont
And
why
I
just
dont
know
[Verse
2:]
Maybe
just
a
nice
cold
brew
whats
a
beer
Thats
the
devil
in
my
ear
I
been
sober
a
fuckin
year
And
that
fucker
still
talks
to
me
he
is
all
I
can
fuckin
hear
Marshall
come
on
well
watch
the
game
its
the
cowboys
and
buccaneers
And
maybe
if
I
just
drink
half
Ill
be
half
as
buzzed
for
half
of
the
time
Whos
the
mastermind
behind
that
little
line
With
that
kind
of
rational
mind
I
got
half
a
mind
To
have
another
half
a
glass
of
wine
sound
asinine
Ya
I
know
But
I
never
had
no
problem
with
alcohol
Ouch
look
out
for
the
wall
aim
for
the
couch
Im
about
to
fall
I
missed
the
couch
and
down
I
go
looking
like
a
bouncing
ball
Shit
must
have
knocked
me
out
cause
I
aint
feel
the
ground
at
all
Wow

night

Man

Shit

All

[Hook:]
Sometimes
I
feel
so
alone
I
just
dont
know
feels
like
I
been
down
this
road
before
So
lonely
and
cold
Its
like
something
takes
over
me
Soon
as
I
go
home
and
close
the
door
Kinda
feels
like

I
wanna
get

from
this
place
I
do
But
I
cant
and
I
wont
say
I
tried
but
I
know
thats
a
lie
cause
I
dont
And
why
I
just
dont

[Verse
3:]
So

a
vicodin
splash

hits
my
stomach
and
ahh
A
couple
weeks

Now

bathroom
floor
[Hook:]
Sometimes
I
feel
so
alone
I
just
dont
know
feels
like
I
been
down
this
road
before
So
lonely
and
cold
Its
like
something
takes
over
me
Soon
as
I
go
home
and
close
the
door
Kinda
feels
like

I
wanna
get
away
from
this
place
I
do
But
I
cant
and
I
wont
say
I
tried
but
I
know
thats
a
lie
cause
I
dont
And
why
I
just
dont
know
Thanks
to
jaydizzledub12
for
correcting
these
lyrics
Lately
Ive
been
hard
to
reach
Ive
been
too
long
on
my
own
Everybody
has
a
private
world
Where
they
can
be
alone
Are
you
calling
me
Are
you
trying
to
get
through
Are
you
reaching
out
for
me
Im
reaching
out
for
you
Im
just
so
fuckin
depressed
I
just
cant
seem
to
get
out
this
slump
If
I
could
just
get
over
this
hump
but
I
need
something
to
pull
me
out
this
dump
I
took
my
bruises
took
my
lumps
fell
down
and
I
got
right
back
up
But
I
need
that
spark
to
get
psyched
back
up
in
order
for
me
to
pick
the
mic
back
up
I
dont
know
how
or
why
or
when
I
ended
up
in
this
position
Im
in
Im
startin
to
feel
distant
again
so
I
decided
just
to
pick
this
pen
Up
and
try
to
make
an
attempt
to
vent
but
I
just
cant
admit
or
come
to
grips
With
the
fact
that
I
may
be
done
with
rap
I
need
a
new
outlet
And
I
know
some
shit
so
hard
to
swallow
but
I
just
cant
sit
back
and
wallow
In
my
own
sorrow
but
I
know
one
fact
Ill
be
one
tough
act
to
follow
One
tough
act
to
follow
Ill
be
one
tough
act
to
follow
Here
today
gone
tomorrow
but
youd
have
to
walk
a
thousand
miles
In
my
shoes
just
to
see
what
its
like
to
be
me
Ill
be
you
lets
trade
shoes
Just
to
see
what
itd
be
like
to
feel
your
pain
you
feel
mine
go
inside
each
others
minds
Just
to
see
what
wed
find
look
at
shit
through
each
others
eyes
But
dont
let
them
say
you
aint
beautiful
They
can
all
get
FUCKED
just
stay
true
to
you
So
dont
let
them
say
you
aint
beautiful
They
can
all
get
FUCKED
just
stay
true
to
you
I
think
Im
startin
to
lose
my
sense
of
humor
everythings
so
tense
and
gloom
I
Almost
feel
like
I
got
to
check
the
temperture
of
the
room
just
as
soon
as
I
walk
in
its
like
all
eyes
on
me
so
I
try
to
avoid
any
eye
contact
Cause
if
I
do
that
then
it
opens
the
door
for
coversation
like
I
want
that
Im
not
looking
for
extra
attention
I
just
want
to
be
just
like
you
Blend
in
with
the
rest
of
the
room
maybe
just
point
me
to
the
closest
restroom
I
dont
need
no
fuckin
man
servant
tryna
follow
me
around
and
wipe
my
ass
And
laugh
at
every
single
joke
I
crack
and
half
of
them
aint
even
funny
like
Ahh
Marshall
youre
so
funny
man
you
should
be
a
comedian
god
damn
Unfortunately
I
am
I
just
hide
behind
the
tears
of
a
clown
So
why
dont
you
all
sit
down
listen
to
the
tale
Im
about
to
tell
Hell
we
aint
gotta
trade
our
shoes
and
you
aint
gotta
walk
no
thousand
miles
In
my
shoes
just
to
see
what
its
like
to
be
me

Just
to
see
what
itd
be
like
to
feel
your
pain
you
feel
mine
go
inside
each
others
minds
Just
to
see
what
wed
find
look
at
shit
through
each
others
eyes
Nobody
asked
for
life
to
deal
us
what
these
bullshit
hands
were
dealt
We
gotta
take
these
cards
ourselves
and
flip
them
dont
expect
no
help
Now
I
could
of
either
just
sat
on
my
ass
and
pissed
and
moaned
Or
take
this
situation
in
which
Im
placed
and
get
up
and
get
my
own
I
was
never
the
type
of
kid
to
wait
by
the
door
and
pack
his
bags
Or
sat
on
the
porch
and
hoped
and
pray
for
a
dad
to
show
up
who
never
did
I
just
wanted
to
fit
in
in
every
single
place
every
school
I
went
I
dreamed
of
being
that
cool
kid
even
if
it
meant
actin
stupid
And
Aunt
Edna
was
told
me
keep
makin
that
face
itll
get
stuck
like
that
Meanwhile
Im
just
standin
there
holdin
my
tongue
tryna
talk
like
thissss
Till
I
stuck
my
tongue
on
that
frozen
stop
sign
pole
at
8
years
old
I
learned
my
lesson
then
cause
I
wasnt
tryin
to
impress
my
friends
no
more
But
I
already
told
you
my
whole
life
story
not
just
based
on
my
description
Cause
where
you
see
it
from
where
youre
sittin
its
probably
110
percent
different
I
guess
we
would
have
to
walk
a
mile
in
each
others
shoes
at
least
What
size
you
wear
I
wear
10s
lets
see
if
you
could
fit
your
feet
In
my
shoes
just
to
see
what
its
like
to
be
me
Ill
be
you
lets
trade
shoes
Just
to
see
what
itd
be
like
to
feel
your
pain
you
feel
mine
go
inside
each
others
minds
Just
to
see
what
wed
find
look
at
shit
through
each
others
eyes
Lately
Ive
been
hard
to
reach
Ive
been
too
long
on
my
own
Everybody
has
their
private
world
Where
they
can
be
alone
Are
you
calling
me
Are
you
trying
to
get
through
Are
you
reaching
out
for
me
Im
reaching
out
for
you
Yeah
to
my
babies
stay
strong
Dad
will
be
home
soon
And
to
the
rest
of
the
world
God
gave
you
them
shoes
to
fit
you
so
put
them
on
and
wear
em
Be
yourself
man
Be
proud
of
who

Even

let
anyone
tell

In

pounds
With

400

and

The
undisputed
most
diabolic
villain
in
the
world:
Slim
Shady
[Chorus:

So

Dont

O-oh

Tahoe
Got
one
riding
shotgun
and

Kiss

Lick

I

Gets

your

If
I
could
fit
the
words
as
picture
perfect
works
every
time
Every
verse
every
line
as
simple
as
nursery
rhymes
Its
elementary
The
elephants
have
entered
the
room
I
venture
to
say
with
the
center
of
attention
its
true
Not
to
mention
back
with
a
vengeance
so
heres
the
signal
Of
the
bat

The
platinum
trios
back
on
you

Stuck

Sometimes

Giant

Prey
Sink
my
teeth
in

and
fill

full
of
poison
And
make
a
noise
like
snake
before
I
kill
him
And
let
him
know
that
I
just
dont
feel
him
And
smack
him
with
the
backward
E

Eminem

Always
thought
if
you
was
gonna
murder
somebody
you
should
face
em
Tell
em
why
look
them
dead
in
the
eye
then
waste
em
And
the
dark
shall
emerge
from
the
fiery
depths
of
hell
And
swallow
the
shell
of
the
hollow
who
dwell
And
the
shadows
of
all
who
are
willing
to
sell
Their
souls
for
this
rap
game
and
it
g-g-goes

that
aint
the
hook
now
follow
me
Theres
nothing
else
for
me
to
say
my
public
adores
me
Everybody
bores
me
theyre
just
so
corny
So
at
night
before
I
sleep
I
look
in
the
mirror
The
mirror
grows
lips
and
it
whispers
Come
nearer
[Chorus]
My
Darling

[Verse
1]
So
this
is
it
This
is
what
I
wished
for
Just
isnt
how
I
envisioned
it
Feigned
to
the
point
of
imprisonment
I
just
thought
the
shitd
be
different
But
something
changed
The
minute
that
I
got
a
whiff
of
it
I
started
to
inhale
it
Smell
it
Started
sniffin
it
And
it
became
my
cocaine
I
just
couldnt
quit
I
just
wanted
a
little
bit
Then
it
turned
me
in
to
a
monster
I
became
a
hypocrite
Concert
after
concert
I
was
raking
in
the
dough
Rolling
in
green
Had
the
game
hemmed
up
Like
a
sewing
machine
But
I
was
losing
my
freedom
There
was
no
where
for
me
To
not
go
and
be
seen
And
just
go
and
be
me
And
there
was
no
in-between
You
either
loved
it
or
hate
it
Every
CD
critics
gave
it
a
3
then
3
Years
later
theyd
go
back
and
re-rate
it
And
call
the
Slim
Shady
LP
the
greatest
The
Marshall
Mathers
was
a
classic
The
Eminem
Show
was
fantastic
But
Encore
just
didnt
have
the
caliber
to
match
it
I
guess
enough
time
just
aint
passed
yet
A
couple
more
years
that
shitll
be
ill-matic
And
eight
years
later
Im
still
at
it
Divorce
re-married
A
felon
A
father
Sleeping
pill
addict
And
this
is
real
talk
I
feel
like
the
Incredible
Hulk
My
back
has
been
broke
and
I
can
still
walk
[Chorus]
So
be
careful
what
you
wish
for
Cause
you
just
might
get
it
And
if
you
get
it
then
you
just
might
not
know
What
to
do
wit
it
cause
it
might
just
Come
back
on
you
ten-fold
I
said
Be
careful
what
you
wish
for
Cause
you
just
might
get
it
And
if
you
get
it
then
you
just
might
not
know
What
to
do
wit
it
cause
it
might
just
Come
back
on
you
ten-fold
[Verse
2]
I
got
a
letter
from
a
fan
that
said
Hes
been
praying
for
me
Every
day
and
for
some
reason
Its
been
weighing
on
my
mind
heavy
Cause
I
dont
read
every
Letter
I
get
but
something
told
me
to
go
ahead
and
open
it
but
Why
would
someone
pray
for
you
when
they
dont
know
you
You
didnt
pray
for
me
when
I
was
local
And
as
I
lay
these
vocals
I
think
of
all
the
shit
I
had
to
go
through
Just
to
get
to
where
Im
at
Ive
already
told
you
at
least
A
thousand
times
in
these
rhymes
I
appreciate
the
prayer
but
Ive
already
got
God
on
my
side
And
its
been
one
hell
of
a
ride
hasnt
it
Just
watchin
it
from
an
opposite
standpoint
Man
boys
got
to
look
Nuts
And
thats
the
only
word
I
can
think
of
right
now
On
how
To
describe
the
shit
This
is
like
a
vibe
you
get
Go
ahead
and
bob
to
it
Just
watch
what
you
wish
for
cause
I
got
the
shit
[Chorus]
So
be
careful
what
you
wish
for
Cause
you
just
might
get
it
And
if
you
get
it
then
you
just
might
not
know
What
to
do
wit
it
cause
it
might
just
Come
back
on
you
ten-fold
I
said
Be
careful
what
you
wish
for
Cause
you
just
might
get
it
And
if
you
get
it
then
you
just
might
not
know
What
to
do
wit
it
cause
it
might
just
Come
back
on
you
ten-fold
It
may
not
mean
nothin
to
yall
But
understand
nothin
was
done
for
me
So
I
dont
plan
on
stoppin
at
all
I
want
this
shit
forever
man—ever
man—ever
man
Im
shuttin
shit
down

Swimmin

If
I

the
club

I
balled—chemo
Dropped
the
mixtape
that
shit
sounded
like
an
album
Whod

thought
a
countrywide
tourd

the
outcome
Labels

my
name
beside
a
X
like
Malcolm
Everybody
got
a

did
it
without
one
Yeah
nigga
Im
about
my
business
Killin
all
these
rappers
you
would
swear
I

a
hit
list
Everyone

is
askin
for
forgiveness
If
you
aint

of

at

you
got
to

It
may
not

They

Back

Bashin

The

This

You

And
spit
true
feelings
until
our
tooth-fillings
come
flyin
up
outta
of
our
mouths—now
rewind
it
Pay

motherfucker
for

When
I

the
taste
outta
your
mouth

bass
so
loud
that
it
shakes
the
place
Im
Hannibal
Lecter

You

Verse
1:]
I
want
you
to
understand
something
That
when
I
come
up
in
this
bitch
I
want
them
fans
jumping
I
want
them
fists
pumping
in
the
air
I
dont
look
like
a
millionaire
But
I
feel
like
a
million
bucks
Ladies
wont
you
fill
your
cups
Shadys
come
to
fill
you
up
if

D
or
a
C-cup
You
can
even
be
a
B

just

and
D-R-E
Youll
be
in
the
E-R
we
are
strapped

We

EMT
Can

to
resuscitate
You

mustard
Whats

problem

grape

Whats
my
name
Shady
came
to
crush
the
game
Instantly
not
even
fair
to
them
cause
they
pale
in
comparisons
So
much
they
might
as
well
wear
a
skin
dont
you
wish
you
could
just
share
his
pen
Cause
this
shit
is
getting
embarrassing
the
fog
is
thick
and
the
air
is
thin
Cause
he
wont
even
let
them
try
to
breathe
Dadidadidadadi
He
makes
it
look
so
easy
Girl
you
just
hit
the
lottery
[Eminem
-
Chorus:]
Now
this
would
be
the
part
of
the
song
Where
they
drop
the
meter
and
hell
breaks
loose
Try
to
restrain
us
you
cant
contain
us
We
still
gonna
make
it
stick
no
matter
what
we
do
Everywhere
we
go
it
seems
we
looking
For
any
excuse
to
just
cut
loose
So
this
would
be
the
part
of
the
song
Where
they
drop
the
meter
and
hell
breaks
loose

Verse
2:]
This
is
when
shit
hits
the
fan
like
it
just
flat
out
dont
stand
This
is
the
only
moment
that
matters
your
homie
rolling
with
Mathers
Then
chaos
erupts
Ems
in
back
Dres
in
the
front
So
do
what
we
say
and
once
its
over
like
a
suance
it
hums
It
makes
them
stay
in
a
trance
No
choice
they
have
to
dance
Its
like
the
playoffs
just
making
sure
that
we
stay
in
the
hunt
Take
a
day
off
or
what
Man
you
better
lay
off
the
blunts
You
must
be
smokin
something
think
I
aint
smokin
nothing
stay
off
my
nuts
Now
hit
the
floor
baby
time
to
wipe
away
all
the
rust
Shake
all
them
cobwebs
loose
loosen
up
with
a
little
bit
of
Grey
Goose
Yeah
girl
shake
that
caboose
I
dont
wanna
see
you
try
to
make
no
excuse
D-R-E
is
on
the
loose
Im
like
a
goose
when
it
comes
to
the
Chronic
use
You
know
I
cant
stand
to
lose
Me
and
my
goons
are
like
animals
Wake
up
like
a
pack
of
wolves
and
we
came
here
to
extract
the
roof
Yeah
man
aint
that
the
truth
Girl
your
mans
is
like
in
the
booth
Definitely
back
up
in
this
bitch
You
swing
All
hell
breaks
loose
[Chorus]
Now
this
would
be
the
part
of
the
song
Where
they
drop
the
meter
and
hell
breaks
loose
Try
to
restrain
us
you
cant
contain
us
We
still
gonna
make
it
stick
no
matter
what
we
do
Everywhere
we
go
it
seems
we
looking
For
any
excuse
to
just
cut
loose
So
this
would
be
the
part
of
the
song
Where
they
drop
the
meter
and
hell
breaks
loose

Round

Visions

With
sugar
plums
oh

Marshall

Hes
placing
hot
smoldering
charcoals
beneath

Now

Like
a
Thanksgiving
turkey
a
holiday
ham
Cinnamon
sprinkled
on
toast
strawberry
marmalade
jam
Flavor
my
favorite
graham
crackers
with
JonBenét
Rams
I
guess
a
modern-day
Jack
the
Ripper
is
all
that
I

My

the
world
to
me
My

So
once

My

I

So

around
and
do
a

for

My

And

be
my
private

I
almost
look
comatose
who

sober
Gross
I
foam
like
a
Doberman
mouth
open
I
overdose
Put
coke
up
my
nostrils
in
both
my
holes
then
I
plug
my
nose
My
pupils
quadruple
in
size
eyes
are
so
bugged
I
know
I
put
on
my
mothers
makeup
get
naked
and
run
around
Waving
the
gun
around
I
think
Im
down
to
a
hundred
pounds
Theres
thunder
I
wonder
how
come
it
rains
but
the
sun
is
out
The
devils

with
his
wife
they
must
be
sluggin
it
out
I
must
be
buggin
the
fuck
out
but
what
the
fuck
about
Voices
are
leading
me
up
to
the
attic
I
love
my
house
They
pull
and
they
tug
my
blouse
the
sound
of
a
music
box
Comes
from
inside
a
toy
chest
but
what
do
I
do
Its
locked
I
pick
it
and
open
it
but
its
stuffed
full
of
human
parts
I
dig
til
I
find
it
I
wind
it
up
and
the
tune
just
starts
Its
playing
a
song
so
beautiful
and
the
room
is
dark
The
moon
is
full
I
smell
a
funeral
guess
Ill
loom
in
the
park
My
music
box
Cause
when
the
lights
are
off
I
see
the
girls
asleep
My
music

But

Through

The
mortician
of

sent
from

Forced

wenchy
the

stingy

Been

than
a
quarter-century
Im

Someone

me
on
the
buns
The
time

come
to

her
up
gotta
roll
me
the
ladder
Ive
had
enough
of
the
chatter
climb
up
to
the
window
look
at
her
Then
climb
in
slow
to
shatter
her
brain
matter
and
batter
her
With
a
bat—a
matter
of
fact
that
will
splatter
her
But
before
I
do
that
Ill
have
a
chat
to
flatter
her
Give
her
two
compliments
back
to
back
like
Tabitha
Im
your
secret
admirer
Im
back
to
ravish
ya
So
strong
is
your
fight
but
youre
no
match
for
Dracula
Prolonging
her
plight
as
I
go
back
to
stabbin
her
Dismember
her
limbs
simple
as
that:
cadaver

I

I
guess
that
opened
up
some
lanes
But
there
was
no
one
who
even
knew
I
was
going
through
growing
pains
Hatred
was
flowing
through
my
veins
on
the
verge
of
going
insane
I
almost
made
a
song
dissing
Lil
Wayne
Its
like
I
was
jealous
of
him
cause
of
the
attention
he
was
getting
I
felt
horrible
about
myself
he
was
spitting
and
I
wasnt
Anyone
who
was
buzzing
back
then
could
of
got
it
Almost
went
at
Kanye
too

feels
like
Im
going
psychotic
Thank

I
didnt
do
it
Id
of
had
my
ass
handed
to

I
knew
it
But

Marshall
youre
no
longer
the
man
thats
a
bitter
pill
to
swallow
All
I
know
is
Im
wallowing
self-loathing
and
hollow
Bottoms
up
on
the
pill
bottle
maybe
I
hit
my
bottom
tomorrow
My
sorrow
echos
in
this

though
But
I
must
be
talking
to
the
wall
though
I
dont
see
nobody
else
I
guess
I
keep
talking
to
myself
But
all
these
other
rappers
suck
is
all
that
I
know
Ive
turned
into
a
hater
I
put
up
a
false
mavado
But
Marshall
is
not
an
egomaniac
thats
not
his
motto
Hes
not
a
desperado
hes
desperate
his
thoughts
are
bottled
Inside
him
one
foot
on
the
brake
one
of
the
throttle
Falling
asleep
with
writers
block
in

of
feeling
sorry
for
yourself

about
it
Admit

Youre

Going
through
peaks
and
valleys
dilly
dallying
Around
with
the
idea
of
ending
the
shit
right
here
Im
hatin
my
reflection
I
walk
around
the
house
tryin
to
fight
mirrors
I
cant
stand
what
I
look
like
yeah
I
look
fat
but
what
do
I
care
I
give
a
fuck
only
thing
I
fear
is
Hailie
Im
afraid
if
I
close
my
eyes
I
might
see
her
Shit
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
I
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom
bathroom
nappin
at
noon
Yeah

in
a
bad
mood
hes
always
snappin
at
you
Marshall
what

at
you

cant
stop
with
these
pills
And
youve
fallen
off
with
your
skills
and
your
own
fans
are
laughin
at
you
It

a
problem
youre
too
pussy
to
tackle

Be
a
man
stand
a
real
man

had
this
shit
handled
Know

your
heart
ripped
out
and
crushed
They

Proof

and
bust
Nah

aint
like
Doody

do
that
He
wouldnt
fuckin
shoot

no-body

But
dwellin

it
only
makes
the
night
worse
Now
Im
poppin
Vics
perks
and
Methadone
pills
Yeah
Em
tight
verse
you
killed
it
Fuckin
drug
dealers

around

And
they
gon
do
whatever
I
says
when
I
says
it
Its
in
their
best
interest
to
protect
their
investment
And
I
just
lost
my
fuckin
best
friend
so
fuck

I
guess
then
[Chorus]
Dont
know
what
Im
going
through
but
I
just
keep
on
going
through
changes
My
friends
just
cant
understand
this
new
me
Thats
understandable
man
but
just
think
how
bananas
youd
be
Youd
be
an
animal
too
if
you
were
trapped
in
this
fame
and
caged
in
it
like
a
zoo
And
everybodys
lookin
at
you
what
you
want
me
to
do
Im
startin
to
live
like
a
recluse
and
the
truth
is
Fame
startin
to
give
me
an
excuse
to
be
at
a
all
time
low
I
sit
alone
in
my
home
theatre
watchin
the
same
damn
DVD
Of
the
first
tour
the
last
tour
he
was
still
alive
And
it
hurt
sore
fast
forward
sleepin
pillsll
make
me
feel
alright
And
if
Im
still
awake
in
the
middle
of
the
night
I
just
take
a
couple
more
yeah

[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Wake
up
in
the
hospital
full
of
tubes
plus
somehow
Im
pullin
through
Swear
when
I
come
back
Ima
be
bulletproof
Ima
do
it
just
for
Proof
I
think
I
should
state
a
few
Facts
cause
I
may
not
get
a
chance
again
to
say
the
truth
Shit
it
just
hit
me
that
what
if
I
would
notta
made
it
through
I
think
about
the
things
I
would
never
got
to
say
to
you
Id
never
get
to
make
it
right
so
heres
what
I
came
to
do
Hailie
this
one
is
for
you
Whitney
and
Alaina
too
I
still
love
your
mother
thatll
never
change
Think
about
her
every
day
we
just
could
never
get
it
together
Hey
wish
there
was
a
better
way
for
me
to
say
it
But
I
swear
on
everything
Id
do
anything
for
her
on
any
day
There
are
just
too
many
things
to
explain
when
it
rains
Guess
it
pours
yes
it
does
wish
there
wasnt
any
pain
But
I
cant
pretend
there
aint
I
aint
placin
any
blame
I
aint
pointin
fingers
heaven
knows
there
never
been
a
saint
I
know
it
just
feels
like
we
just
pissed
away
our
history
But
just
today
I
looked
at
your
picture
almost
hate
to
say
I
miss
you
self
consciously
wish
it
didnt
end
this
way
But
I
just
had
to
get
away
dont
know
why
I
dont
know
what
else
to
say
I
guess
Im
[Chorus]
Yeah
its
been
a
ride
I
guess
I
had
to
go
to
that
place
to
get
to
this
one
Now
some
of
you
might
still
be
in
that
place
If
youre
tryin
to
get
out
Just
follow
me
Ill
get
you
there
You
can
try
and
read
my
lyric
off
of
this
paper
before
I
lay
em
But
you
wont
take
the
sting
out
these
words
before
I
say
em
Cause

no
way
Ima
let
you
stop
me
from
causin
mayhem
When
I
say
Ima

somethin
I

it
I
dont
give
a
damn
What
you
think
Im
doin
this
for
me
so
fuck
the
world
Feed

gassed
up
if
it
thinks
its
stoppin
me
Ima
be
what
I
set
out
to
be
without
a
doubt
undoubtably
And
all
those
who
look
down
on
me
Im
tearin
down
your
balcony
No
ifs
ands
or
buts
dont
try
to
ask
him
why
or
how
can
he
From
Infinite
down
to
the
last
Relapse
album
hes
Still
shittin
whether
hes
on
salary
paid
hourly
Until
he
bows
out
or
he
shits
his
bowels
out
of
him
Whichever
comes
first
for
better
or
worse
Hes
married
to
the
game
Like
a
fuck
you
for
Christmas:
his
gift
is
a
curse
Forget
the
Earth
hes
got
the
urge
to
pull
his
dick
from
the
dirt
And
fuck
the
whole
Universe
Im
not
afraid
to
take
a
stand
Everybody
come
take
my
hand
Well
walk
this
road
together
through
the
storm
Whatever
weather
cold
or
warm
Just
lettin
you
know
that
youre
not
alone
Holla
if
you
feel
like
youve
been
down
the
same
road
Okay
quit
playin
with
the
scissors
and
shit
and
cut
the
crap
I
shouldnt
have
to
rhyme
these
words
in
a
rhythm
For
you
to
know
its
a
wrap
You
said
you
was
king
you
lied
through
your
teeth
For
that
fuck
your
feelings
Instead
of
gettin
crowned
youre
gettin
capped
And
to
the
fans
Ill
never
let
you
down
again
Im
back
I
promise
to
never
go
back
on
that
promise
In
fact
lets
be
honest
that
last
Relapse
CD
was
ehhhh
Perhaps
I
ran
them
accents
into
the
ground
Relax
I
aint
goin
back
to
that
now
All
Im
tryin
to
say
is
get
back
click-clack
BLAOW
Cause
I
aint
playin
around
Theres
a
game
called
circle
and
I
dont
know
how
Im
way
too
up
to
back
down
But
I
think
Im
still
tryin
to
figure
this
crap
out
Thought
I
had
it
mapped
out
But
I
guess
I
didnt
this
fuckin
black
cloud
Still
follows
me
around
but
its
time
to
exorcise
these
demons
These
muhfuckers
are
doin
jumpin
jacks
now
Im
not
afraid
to
take
a
stand
Everybody
come
take
my
hand
Well
walk
this
road
together
through
the
storm
Whatever
weather
cold
or
warm
Just
lettin
you
know
that
youre
not
alone
Holla
if
you
feel
like
youve
been
down
the
same
road
And
I
just
cant
keep
livin
this
way
So
startin
today
Im
breakin
out
of
this
cage
Im
standin
up
Ima
face
my
demons
Im
mannin
up
Ima
hold
my
ground
Ive
had
enough
now
Im
so
fed
up
Time
to
put
my
life
back
together
right
now
It
was
my
decision
to
get
clean
I
did
it
for
me
Admittedly
I
probably
did
it
subliminally
for
you
So
I
could
come
back
a
brand-new
me
You
helped
see
me
through
And
dont
even
realize
what
you
did
believe
me
you
Ive
been
through
the
wringer
But
they
can
do
little
to
the
middle
finger
I
think
I
got
a
tear
in
my
eye
I
feel
like
the
king
of
My
world
haters
can
make
like
bees
with
no
stingers
And
drop
dead:
no
more
beef
flingers
No
more
drama
from
now
on
I
promise
To
focus
solely
on
handlin
my
responsibilities
as
a
father
So
I
solemnly
swear
to
always
treat
this
roof
like
my
daughters
And
raise
it
you
couldnt
lift
a
single
shingle
on
it
Cause
the
way
I
feel
Im
strong
enough
to
go
to
the
club
Or
the
corner
pub
and
lift
the
whole
liquor
counter
up
Cause
Im
raisin
the
bar
Id
shoot
for
the
moon
but
Im
too
busy
gazin
at
stars
I
feel
amazin
and
Im
Im
not
afraid
to
take
a
stand
Everybody
come
take
my
hand
Well
walk
this
road
together
through
the
storm
Whatever
weather
cold
or
warm
Just
lettin
you
know
that
youre
not
alone
Holla
if
you
feel
like
youve
been
down
the
same
road
Intro

Lil

Throw
dirt
on
me
and
grow
a
wildflower
But
its
fuck
the
world
get
a
child
out
her
Yeah
my
life
a
bitch
but
you
know
nothing
bout
her
Been
to
hell
and
back
I
can
show
you
vouchers
Im
rolling
Sweets
Im
smoking
sour
Married
to
the
game
but
she
broke
her
vows
Thats
why
my
bars
are
full
of
broken
bottles
And
my
night
stands
are
full
of
open
Bibles
I
think
about
more
than
I
forget
But
I
dont
go
around
fire
expecting
not
to
sweat
And
these
niggas
know
I
lay
them
down
make
their
bed
Bitches
try
to
kick
me
while
Im
down:
Ill
break
your
leg
Money
outweighing
problems
on
the
triple
beam
Im
sticking
to
the
script
you
niggas
skipping
scenes
Be
good
or
be
good
at
it
Fucking
right
Ive
got
my
gun
semi-Cartermatic
Yeah
put
a
dick
in
their
mouth
so
I
guess
its
fuck
what
they
say
Im
high
as
a
bitch:
up
up
and
away
Man
I
come
down
in
a
couple
of
days
OK
you
want
me
up
in
the
cage
then
Ill
come
out
in
beast
mode
I
got
this
world
stuck
in
the
safe
combination
is
the
G-code
Its
Weezy
motherfucker
blood
gang
and
Im
in
bleed
mode
All
about
my
dough
but
I
dont
even
check
the
peephole
So
you
can
keep
knocking
but
wont
knock
me
down
No
love
lost
no
love
found
[Hook

Eminem
&
Lil

Its
a
little
too
late
to
say

You
kicked
me
when
I
was
down
Fuck

say
just
dont
hurt

me
no
more
Thats
right
bitch:
and
I
dont
need
you
dont
want
to
see
you
Bitch

get
no
love
You
show
me
nothing
but
hate
You
ran
me
into
the
ground
But
what
comes
around
goes
around
I
dont
need
you
dont
hurt
me
You
dont
hurt
me
no
more
Thats
right
and
I
dont
need
you
dont
want

You
get
no
love
Bitch

no
love
And

To

pen
Im

little
bit
sicker

Shits

But

in
I
aint
never
giving
in
again
Cuss
into
the
wind
complete
freedom
Look
at
these
rappers
how
I
treat
them
So
why
the
fuck
would
I
join
them
when
I
beat
them
They
call
me
a
freak
because
I
like
to
spit
on
these
pussies
fore
I
eat
them
Man
get
these
whack
cocksuckers
off
stage
Where
the
fuck
is
Kanye
when
you
need
him
Snatch
the
mic
from
him
bitch
Imma
let
you
finish
in
a
minute
Yeah
the
rap
is
tight
But
Im
fucking
with
the
greatest
verse
of
all
time
So
you
might
want
to
go
back
to
the
lab
tonight
and
um
Scribble
out
them
rhymes
you
were
going
to
spit
And
start
over
from
scratch
and
write
new
ones
But
Im
afraid
that
it
aint
gonna
make
no
difference
When
I
rip
this
stage
and
tear
it
in
half
tonight
Its
an
adrenaline
rush
to
feel
the
bass
thump
In
the
place
all
the
way
to
the
parking
lot
fellow
Set
fire
to
the
mic
and
ignite
the
crowd
You
can
see
the
sparks
from
hot
metal
Cold-hearted
from
the
day
I
Bogarted
the
game
I
so
started
to
rock
fellow
When
Im
not
even
in
my
harshest
You
can
still
get
roasted
because
Marsh
is
not
mellow
Til
Im
toppling
from
the
top
Im
not
going
to
stop
Im
standing
on
my
Monopoly
board
That
means
Im
on
top
of
my
game
and
it
dont
stop
Til
my
hip
dont
hop
anymore
When
you
so
good
that
you
cant
say
it
Because
it
aint
even
cool
for
you
to
sound
cocky
anymore
People
just
get
sick
cause
you
spit
These
fools
cant
drool
or
dribble
a
drop
anymore
And
you
can
never
break
my
stride
You
never
slow
the
momentum
at
any
moment
Im
about
to
blow
Youll
never
take
my
pride
Killing
the
flow
slow
venom
and
the
opponent
Is
getting
no
mercy
mark
my
words
Aint
letting
up
relentless
I
smell
blood
I
dont
give
a
fuck:
keep
giving
them
hell
Where
was
you
when
I
fell
and
needed
help
up
You
get
no
love
Grazie
a
Marco
per
questo
testo
We
touch
I
feel
a
rush
We
clutch
it
isnt
much
But
its
enough
to
make
me
wonder
whats
in
store
for
us
Its
lust
its
torcherous
You
must
be
a
socerous
cause
you
just
Did
the
impossible
Game
I
trust
dont
play
games
itll
be
dangerous
If
you
fuck
me
over
Cause
if
I
get
burnt
imma
show
you
what
its
like
to
hurt
Cause
I
been
treated
like
dirt
before
ya
And
love
is
evil
Spell
it
backwards
Ill
show
ya
Nobody
knows
me
Im
cold
Walk
down
this
road
all
alone
Its
noones
fault
but
my
own
Its
the
path
ive
chosen
to
go
Frozen
as
snow
I
show
no
emotion
whatsoever
so
Dont
ask
me
why
I
have
no
love
for
these
mufuckin
hos
Bloodsuckin
suckubusses
what
the
fuck
is
up
with
this
Ive
tried
in
this
department
but
I
aint
had
no
luck
with
this
Its
sucks
but
its
exactly
what
I
thought
it
would
be
Like
tryin
to
start
over
I
gotta
hole
in
my
heart
Im
some
kind
of
emotional
rollercoaster
Somethin
I
wont
go
on
til
you
toy
with
my
emotion
so
its
over
Its
like
an
explosion
everytime
I
hold
ya
wasnt
jokin
when
I
told
ya
Ya
take
my
breathe
away
Your
a
supernova
and
Im
a
Im
a
space
bound
rocketship
and
your
hearts
the
moon
And
I
aim
it
right
at
you
Right
at
you
250
thousand
miles
and
a
clear
night
in
june
And
I
aim
it
right
at
you
Right
at
you
Right
at
you
I
do
whatever
it
takes
When
Im
with
you
I
get
the
shakes
My
body
aikes
when
I
aint
With
you
I
have
zero
strength
Theres
no
limit
on
how
far
I
would
go
No
boundries
no
lengths
Why
do
we
say
that
until
we
get
that
person
that
we
thinks
Gonna
be
that
one
and
then
once
we
get
em
its
never
the
same
You
want
them
when
they
dont
want
you
Soon
as
they
do
feelings
change
Its
not
a
contest
and
I
aint
on
no
conquest
for
no
mate
I
wasnt
lookin
but
I
stumbled
onto
you
mustve
been
fate
But
so
much
is
at
stake
what
the
fuck
does
it
take
Lets
cut
to
the
chase
But
a
door
shuts
in
your
face
Promise
me
if
I
cave
in
and
break
and
leave
myself
open
That
I
wont
be
makin
a
mistake
Im
a
space
bound
rocketship
and
your
hearts
the
moon
And
I
aim
it
right
at
you
Right
at
you
250
thousand
miles
and
a
clear
night
in
june
And
I
aim
it
right
at
you
Right
at
you
Right
at
you
So
after
a
year
and
6
months
its
no
longer
me
that
you
want
But
I
love
you
so
much
it
hurts
Never
mistreated
you
once
I
poured
my
heart
out
to
you
Let
down
my
guard
swear
to
god
Ill
blow
my
brains
in
your
lap
Lay
here
and
die
in
your
arms
Up
to
my
knees
and
Im
bleedin
Im
tryin
to
stop
you
from
leavin
You
wont
even
listen
so
fuck
it
Im
tryin
to
stop
you
from
breathin
I
put
both
hands
on
your
throat
I
sit
on
top
of
you
squeezin
Til
I
snap
ya
neck
like
a
popsicle
stick
Aint
no
possible
reason
I
could
think
of
to
let
you
walk
up
out
this
house
And
let
you
live
Tears
streamed
down
both
of
my
cheeks
Then
I
let
you
just
go
and
just
give
And
before
I
put
that
gun
to
my
temple
I
told
you
this
And
I
would
do
anything
for
you
To
show
you
how
much
I
adored
you
But
its
over
now
Its
too
late
to
save
our
love
Just
promise
me
youll
think
of
me
everytime
you
look
up
in
the
sky
and
see
a
star
cause
imma
Im
a
space
bound
rocketship
and
your
hearts
the
moon
And
I
aim
it
right
at
you
Right

you
250
thousand
miles
and
a
clear
night
in
june
And

taking
my
life

Caught
in
a
chase
25
to
life
I
dont
think
she
understands
the
sacrifices
that
Ive
made
Maybe
if
this
bitch
had
acted
right
I
woulda
stayed
But
Ive
already
wasted
over
half
my
life
I
woulda
laid
Down
and
died
for
you
I
no
longer
cry
for
you
no
more
pain
Bitch
you
took
me
for
granted
Took
my
heart
and
ran
it
straight
into
the
planet
Into
the
dirt
I
can
no
longer
stand
it
Now
my
respect
I
demand
it
Ima
take
control
of
this
relationship
command
it
And
Ima
be
the
boss
of
you
now
goddamn
it
And
what
I
mean
is
that
I
will
no
longer
let
you
control
me
So
you
better
hear
me
out
this
much
you
owe
me
I
gave
up
my
life
for
you
totally
devoted
to
you
I
have
stayed
Faithful
all
the
way
this
is
how
I
fuckin
get
repaid
Look
at
how
I
dress
fuckin
baggy
sweats
go
to
work
a
mess
Always
in
a
rush
to
get
back
to
you
I
aint
heard
you
yet
Not
even
once
say
you
appreciate
me
I
deserve
respect
Ive
done
my
best
to
give
you
nothin
less
than
perfectness
And
I
know
that
if
I
end
this
Ill
no
longer
have
nothin
left
But
you
keep
treatin
me
like
a
staircase:
its
time
to
fuckin
step
And
I
wont
be
comin
back
so
dont
hold
your
fuckin
breath
You
know
what
youve
done
no
need
to
go
in
depth
I
told
you
youd
be
sorry
if
I
fuckin
left
I
laughed
while
you
wept
hows
it
feel
now
Yeah
funny
aint
it
You
neglected
me
Did
me
a
favor
though
my
spirit
free
youve
set
But
a
special
place
for
you
in
my
heart
I
have
kept
Its
unfortunate
but
its…
Too
late
for
the
other
side
Caught
in
a
chase
25
to
life
Cant
take
no
more
Too
late
for
the
other
side
Caught
in
a
chase
25
to
life
I
feel
like
when
I
bend
over
backwards
for
you
all
you
do
is
laugh
‘Cause
that
aint
good
enough
You
expect
me
to
fold
myself
in
half
til
I
snap
Dont
think
Im
loyal
all
I
do
is
rap
How
can
I
moonlight
on
the
side
I
have
no
life
outside
of
that
Dont
I
give
you
enough
of
my
time
You
dont
think
so
do
you
Jealous
when
I
spend
time
with
the
girls
Why

Man

dont
know
But

Im
serving
you
with
papers
Im
divorcing
you
–

marry
someone
else
and
make
em
famous
And
take
away
their
freedom
like
you
did
to
me
Treat
em
like
you
dont
need
em
and
they
aint
worthy
of
you
Feed

same
shit
that
you
made
me
eat
Im
moving
on

you
Oh

special
I
aint
feel
special
when
I
was
with
you
All
I
ever
felt
was
this
helplessness
Imprisoned
by
a
selfish
bitch
Chew

up
and
spit
me
out
I
fell
for
this
So
many
times
its
ridiculous
And

Now
there
he
goes
in
Dres
studio
cupping
his
balls
Screaming
the
wood
off
the
panelling
cussing
the
paint
off
the
walls
Spewing
his
hate
to
these
haters
showing
no
love
for
these
broads
He
aint
giving
em
shit
hes
scissor
pinch
a
penny
so
hard
Hell
leave
a
bruise
on
the
brawn
so
dark
You
can
see
the
mark
when
it
scars
til
Abraham
Lincoln
is
screaming
out
AHHH
His
metaphors
and
similies
aint
similar
to
them
not
at
all
If
they
dont
like
they
can
all
get
fucked
instead
of
sucking
him
off
They
can
go
get
a
belt
or
a
neck
tie
to
hang
themselves
by
Like
David
Carridy
they
can
go
fuck
themselves
and
just
die
And
eat
shit
while
they
at
it
hes
fucking
had
it
Hes
mad
at
the
whole
world
so
go
to
hell
and
build
a
snowman
girl
The
bullies
become
bullied
the
pussies
get
pushed
They
better
pull
me
take
me
back
to
9th
grade
to
school
me
Cause
I
aint
looking
back
only
forward
this
whole
spot
blowing
Who
coulda
known
hed
grow
to
be
a
poet
and
not
know
it
And
while
Im
being
poetic
let
me
get
a
stork
And
raise
the
bar
higher
than
my
opinion
of
these
women

So
bare
witness
to
some
biblical
shit
As
the
cold
wind
blowing
this
world
aint
gonna
know
what
hit
it
he
did
it
he
made
it
hes
finally
famous

Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
Well
thats
all
right
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
Well
thats
all
right
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
cant
tell
you
what
it
really
is
I
can
only
tell
you
what
it
feels
like
And
right
now
theres
a
steel
knife
in
my
windpipe
I
cant
breathe
but
I
still
fight
while
I
can
fight
As
long
as
the
wrong
feels
right
its
like
Im
in
flight
High
off
her
love
drunk
from
her
hate
Its
like
Im
huffing
paint
and
I
love
her
the
more
I
suffer
I
suffocate
and
right
before
Im
about
to
drown
She
resuscitates
me
she
fucking
hates
me
and
I
love
it
Wait
where
you
going
Im
leaving
you
No
you
aint
come
back
Were
running
right
back
here
we
go
again
Its
so
insane
cause
when
its
going
good
its
going
great
Im
Superman
with
the
wind
at
his
back
shes
Lois
Lane
But
when
its
bad
its
awful
I
feel
so
ashamed
I
snap
Whos
that
dude
I
dont
even
know
his
name
I
laid
hands
on
her
Ill
never
stoop
so
low
again
I
guess
I
dont
know
my
own
strength
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
Well
thats
all
right
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
Well
thats
all
right
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
You
ever
love
somebody
so
much
You
can
barely
breathe
when
youre
with
them
You
meet
and
neither
one
of
you
even
know
what
hit
them
Got
that
warm
fuzzy
feeling
Yeah
them
chills
used
to
get
them
Now
youre
getting
fucking
sick
of
looking
at
them
You
swore
youd
never
hit
them
never
do
nothing
to
hurt
them
Now
youre
in
each
others
face
Spewing
venom
in
your
words
when
you
spit
them
You
push
pull
each
others
hair
scratch
claw
bit
them
Throw
them
down
pin
them
So
lost
in
the
moments
when
youre
in
em
Its
the
rage
that
took
over
it
controls
you
both
So
they
say
its
best
to
go
your
separate
ways
Guess
that
they
dont
know
you
Cause
today
that
was
yesterday
Yesterday
is
over
its
a
different
day
Sound
like
broken
records
playing
over
But
you
promised
her
next
time
youd
show
restraint
You
dont
get
another
chance
life
is
no
Nintendo
game
But
you
lied
again
Now
you
get
to
watch
her
leave
out
the
window
Guess
thats
why
they
call
it
window
pane
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
Well
thats
all
right
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
Well
thats
all
right
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
Now
I
know
we
said
things
did
things
that
we
didnt
mean
And
we
fall
back
into
the
same
patterns
same
routines
But
your
tempers
just
as
bad
as
mine
is
Youre
the
same
as
me
When
it
comes
to
love
youre
just
as
blinded
Baby
please
come
back
it
wasnt
you
baby
it
was
me
Maybe
our
relationship
isnt
as
crazy
as
it
seems
Maybe
thats
what
happens
when
a
tornado
meets
a
volcano
All
I
know
is
I
love
you
too
much
to
walk
away
though
Come
inside
pick
up
your
bags
off
the
sidewalk
Dont
you
hear
sincerity
in
my
voice
when
I
talk
Told
you
this
is
my
fault
look
me
in
the
eyeball
Next
time
Im
pissed
Ill
aim
my
fist
at
the
drywall
Next
time
There
wont
be
no
next
time
I
apologize
even
though
I
know
its
lies
Im
tired
of
the
games
I
just
want
her
back
I
know
Im
a
liar
if
she
ever
tries
to
fucking
leave
again
Ima
tie
her
to
the
bed
and
set
this
house
on
fire
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
Well
thats
all
right
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
Well
thats
all
right
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie

me
nauseous
But

hallways
You

faith
in

Proof

Come

Homie

Im

Matter

just
the
other
night
had
another
dream
about
you
You
told
me
to
get
up
I
got
up
and
spread
my
wings
and
I
flew
You
gave
me
a
reason
to
fight
I
was
on
my
way
to
see
you
You
told
me
nah
Dudey

not
layin
on
that
table
I
knew
I
was
gonna
make
it
soon
as
you

There

no
way
that
I
was
gonna
ever
leave

babies
and
Proof
Not
many
are
lucky
enough
to
have
a
guardian
angel
like
you
Lord
Im
so
thankful
please
dont
think
I
dont
feel
grateful
I
do
Just
grant
me
the
strength
that
I
need
for
one
more
day
to
get
through
So

is
your
song
I
dedicate
this
to
you
I

Dudey
Hook
The

The

the
days
of

You

testo
[Intro:]
Aw
man
yea
You
ever
be
in
the
club
man
you
get
in
a
fight
And
people
that
you
dont
even
know
jump
in
[Verse
1:]
You
feel
like
you
wanna
hit
something
your
fist
clenches
your
pissed
You
just
wanna
get
someone
with
shit
jump
em
[
]
Youre
bout
to
get
your
shit
pushed
in
Im
just
inches
away
Im
splitting
your
shit
wide
open
no
stitches
could
save
So
die
with
your
eyes
open
you
hope
this
isnt
the
way
You
end
up
going
out
but
I
guess
it
just
is
Im
afraid
Razors
scissors
and
blades
make
Jason
say
isnt
this
great
On-lookers
participate
in
this
ass-kicking
debate
Theyre
starting
to
take
place
in
the
middle
of
the
street
Little
did
you
know
thered
be
an
all-out
brawl
soon
as
you
heard
this
beat
Emergency
personnel
rush
to
the
murder
scene
but
its
too
late
Its
absolute
pandemonium
whisked
away
In
a
ambulance
is
your
fate
nothing
nobody
told
you
when
you-
Left
your
house
today
coulda
made
you
anticipate
Such
an
ass
whooping
okay
til
the
anger
dissipates
You
get
punched
in
the
face
reciprocate
[Chorus:
x2]
So
what
the
deal
ridaz
Would
you
excuse
me
while
I
feel
my
nuts
My
balls
are
feeling
a-mighty
big
now
I
might
just
have
to
dig
down
and
pull
em
through
my
britches
I
said
[Verse
2:]
You
step
in
the
place
with
enough
misplaced
anger
to
catch
a
case
Anxious
to
get
in
some
shit
got
your
gangstas
all
with
your
ladies
You
better
go
get
your
mase
cause
shady
said
so
You
may
wanna
pick
up
the
radio
and
bang
it
against
your
face
Thats
how
f-king
rowdy
you
feel
now
do
you
still
wanna
grill
If
you
dont
wanna
get
the
shit
beat
outta
you
chill
Cause
if
you
doubt
me
you
will
yea
got
me
a
pill
found
me
a
thrill
I
got
a
couple
of
drinks
here
and
Im
bound
to
refill
Girl
howdy
how
do
you
feel
ma
This
c-ksucker
did
not
spill
my
drink
Oh
HELL
no
He
must
be
tryna
kill
my
buzz
I
will
not
budge
And
what
the
deal
ridaz
Now
here
they
all
come
and
they
got
your
back
in
like
2
seconds
flat
Thats
probably
a
record
yea
you
wasnt
expecting
that
Cause
they
want
in
on
the
act
theres
a
cognac-
Bottle
we
snuck
it
in
cause
the
beer
that
they
were
serving
here
was
only
tap
Im
biting
I
fight
dirty
you
might
get
kicked
in
the
nuts
Youre
frightened
like
this
guy
might
hurt
me
Youre
quite
certain
hes
nuts
Ive
hit
myself
in
the
face
harder
Play
smarter
you
may
start
a
[
]
you
need
a
chainsaw
to
Dig
your
way
out
of
go
powder
your
nose-
P-sy
the
harder
you
yell
the
harder
I
slap
the
shit
out
of
you
hoes
You
set
it
off
fa-ot
so
now
how
do
you
spose-
We
settle
it
hit
me
in
the
nose
well
see
how
it
goes
[Chorus
x2]
Its
shear
hustle
I
bob
weave
deflate
your
beer
muscles
Were
tussling
the
crowds
starting
to
cheer
us
And
adrenalines
rushing
through
us
just
like
a
geyser
gushing
Too
much
Budweiser
in
my
blood
Im
strangling
your
windpipe
And
[
]
my
signatures
ligature
marks
Look
at
you
all
big
with
your
remarks
and
I
swing
an
icepick
at
your
heart
At
least
thats
what
it
feels
like
when
I
pick
you
apart
And
dig
at
you
and
break
you
down
like
the
bitch
that
you
are
The
predicament
starts
when
I
throw
a
brick
at
your
car
The
pain
inflicted
upon
you
its
so
sick
its
bizarre
Shit
this
is
almost
ridiculous
addictive
as
far
As
having
me
wanna
rip
out
your
frickin
ligaments
ARGH
You
hit
like
a
bitch
you
scratch
me
with
your
nails
for
that-
You
catch
an
open-hand
slap
break
off
your
nail
like
BAP
In
fact
Ill
have
the
crowd
smacking
you
themselves
Wheres
D12
I
dont
feel
like
doing
this
by
myself
[Chorus
x2]
[Eminem:]

Millions

What

Aww

[Verse

Obie

Obie
the
person
that
came
up
and
deverted
Cause
of
nervousness
That
was
solely
the
homies
verdict
It
was
worth
it
Cause
he
changed
became
so
I
observed
it
Certain
such
of
a
purpose
Its
like
a
different
version
So
much
hurtin
and
pain
Gave
him
game
for
certain
Thats
why
its
curtains
at
his
murder
if
you
get
him
worked
up
Im
so
assertive
on
these
motherfuckers
actin
tougher
Had
enough
of
Isolating
myself
in
a
room
Writing
poems
for
songs
doin
the
same
in
school
Now
look
what
he
became
a
fool
Cause
he
learned
how
to
sustain
his
two
And
obtain
fame
from
you
Living
hard
but
still
Julliard
A
god
walks
and
aint
spent

Regardless
of
this

So
welcome

I
stimulate

Emulate

Sick

Clinically

Brain

Suck

Uranus
Label
me
a
genius
if
you
ever
seen
as
you
would
say
He
may
seem
as
though
hes
plain
normal
If
you
ever
meet
him
greet
him
with
a
shake
see
he
aint
as
mean
as
what
they
say
See
the
thing
is
maybe
he
cant
always
think
of
things
to
say
so
hes
vague
So
they
mistake
him
for
just
bein
crazed
You
dont
think
hes
strange
You
turn
around
and
tell
him
please
and
thanks
And
catch
him
flippin
you
off
with
his
pants
down
Hands
around
His
Scrotum
tuckin
his
fuckin
Penis
between
his
legs

Smoke

Let

Not

I

Strap

and
electrocute
her
Im
off

Im

I

shoot
my

Spit

while
I

And

I

with
an
uneasy
stomach
I
pass
by
people
on
the
street
they
seem
like
sheep
and
zombies
Stiffer
than
a
therapeutic
pair
of
jeans
you
run
in
So
can
you
hear
me
coming
Eminem
this
beat
is
absolutely
disgusting
Its
probably
go
diseases
on
it
Im
just
being
honest
I
can
see
the
comments
I
can
see
the
evolution
as
we
creep
up
on
it
I
put
that
music
in
your
veins
like
a
needle
junkie
Shit
I
just
do
this
for
the
haters
I
dont
need
the
money
I
diarrhea
on
track
so
it
needs
plunging
Somebody
tell
these
girls
please
release
my
undies
Nobody
really
understands
my
language
I
find
it
complicated
just
to
hold
a
conversation
But
still
I
got
a
whole
lot
of
patience
Sittin
back
watching
Earth
from
my
Space
station
[Chorus:
Eminem]
Theres
no
need
to
say
shit
you
already
know
The
question
is
just
how
far
will
this
go
How
far
will
he
take
it
And
when
will
he
stop
Shady
man
I
done
told
you
once
homie
to
easy
up
But
you
just
wont
listen
will
ya
nah
I
guess
not
You
just
cant
can
ya
man
I
cant
stand
ya
Youre
rotten
what
you

Man
when
are
you
gonna
let

I
guess
things
are
gonna
get
much
worse
fore
they
get
better

3:

Oh

Of

saw
her
fanny
then
murdered
her
while

danced
around
the
room
and
wore
her
panties
[Chorus:
Eminem]
Theres
no
need

The
question
is
just
how
far
will
this
go
How

And

[INTRO]
Im
a
little
nutty
and
I
know
it
but
if
you
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
my
history
you
will
see
that
Im
not
the
only
one
whos
off
his
rocker
there
were
many
before
me
I
was
always
labelled
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
what
a
bad
seed
I
grow
to
be
but
if
you
take
a
look
at
us
now
youll
see
the
apple
didnt
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
[VERSE
1]
haha
alright
look
Ima
tell
you
the
story
from
my
side
maybe
youll
understand
check
it
out
you
done
witnessed
unexplainable
shit
too
insane
to
explain
people
run
from
what
the
just
dont
get
maybe
Shady
shoulda
just
hit
em
with
a
little
bit
did
I
spit
too
soon
Should
I
of
spoon
fed
em
it
but
I
was
just
so
eager
to
prove
I
was
even
worth
being
in
the
same
league
or
the
room
with
of
the
people
of
whom
I
was
in
every
now
and
then
I
look
up
like
I
was
seeking
approval
was
it
because
of
the
pigment
of
my
skin
or
was
it
a
figment
of
my
imagination
maybe
it
bothered
me
more
than
it
did
them
maybe
it
wasnt
a
big
deal
back
then
but
to
me
it
was
see
what
it
was
was
I
had
developed
the
complex
from
being
judged
Proof
spit
his
verse
now
Im
next
lets
see
who
Im
in
the
booth
staring
back
to
see
whos
mugs
I
get
a
reaction
from
usually
the
first
thumb
was
from
Proof
and
the
rest
of
the
group
backed
him
up
and
no
one
lied
to
each
other
cause
none
of
us
had
deals
it
was
real
we
just
wanted
tickets
for
that
meal
[CHORUS]
Sometimes
I
feel
like
its
just
me
sometimes
I
feel
like
Im
going
crazy
but
take
a
look
at
my
family
cause
the
apple
dont
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
I
said

sometimes
I
feel
like
its
just
me
sometimes
I
feel
like
Im
going
crazy
but
take
a
look
at
my
family
cause
the
apple
dont
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
[VERSE
2]
Ever
since
my
mother
was
pregnant
with
her
second
egg
cause
she
said
that
I
had
a
baby
sister
who
fell
out
of
the
window
I
was
too
young
to
remember
Kansas
City
projects
I
was
like
5
6
and
how
come
I
remember
Malcolm
Isaac
and
Boogie
if
it
was
the
projects
in
Missouri
cause
thosere
my
best
friends
until
Isaac
took
my
tricycle
and
my
uncle
Todd
went
to
try
to
go
get
it
back
and
ended
up
getting
jumped
and
cut
in
the
gut
with
a
switch
and
70-some
stitches
which
is
still
to
this
day
why
my
mother
still
tries
to
show
me
some
old
fake
picture
of
a
fictitious
little
sister
who
never
existed
and
this
is
why
part
of
my
lifes
so
twisted
but
I
can
never
be
as
sick
as
that
bitch
is
and
by
the
way
that
pictures
one
of
my
relatives
[CHORUS]
Sometimes
I
feel
like
its
just
me
sometimes
I
feel
like
Im
going
crazy
but
take
a
look
at
my
family
cause

3]
You
probably
have
to
peel
back
layers
upon
layers
of
pain
to
see
why
everything
I
say
is
so
insane
whats
different
about
my
brain
that
separates
me
from
other
players
in
this
game
on
the
surface
it
may
seem
like
a
scheme
or
some
sort
of
scam
for
me
to
get
some
damn
sympathy
but
thats
the
last
thing
I
need
is
for
people
to
walk
around
feeling
sorry
for
me
me
and
Im
not
a
G
never
claimed
to
be
I
gave
my
vest
to
Cashis
hell
need
it
more
than
me
but
well
see
cause
we
aint
lookin
for
beef
but
if
it
comes
our
way
what
do
we
turn
the
other
cheek
come
on
[CHORUS]

Thanks

I
just
cant

With
the
stress
this
game
is
giving
me
But
before
I
go
You
know
I
cant
close
the
show
Without
no
closure
So
before
I
leave
Yeah
I
just
want
to
take
the
time
out
to
basically
say
Rest
In
Peace
to
Deshaun
Holton
Thats
my
heart
man
Dr
Dre
For
giving
me
the
oppurtunity
just
to
even
listen
to
me
to
get
me
to
this
point
Id
like
to
thank
Jimmy
Iovine
Interscope
Aftermath

the
whole
Shady

me

Some
people
ask
me
where
Ive
been
lately
They
thought
I
fell
off
nobody
could
save
me
I

the
background
I
dont
back
down
So
dont
get
it
twisted
tryna
play
me
First
I
come
out
they
underate
me
Then
I
come
back
still
try
to

They

Im

Ask

I

It

so
I

It

Cos

The

to

And
theres

so
I

And

I

Im

so
i
may
aswell

[Just
Blaze
-
Chorus]
[Verse
1]
Its
like
Im
in
this
dirt
digging
up
old
hurt
Tried
everything
to
get
my
mind
off
you
it
wont
work
All
it
takes
is
one
song
on
the
radio
youre
right
back
on
it
Reminding
me
all
over
again
how
you
fucking
just
brushed
me
off
And
left
me
so
burnt
spent
a
lot
of
time
trying
to
soul
search
Maybe
I
needed
to
grow
up
a
little
first
Well
looks
like
I
hit
a
growth
spurt
But
I
am
coming
for
closure
Dont
suppose
an
explanation
Im
owed
for
The
way
that
you
turned
your
back
on
me
Just
when
I
may
have
needed
you
most
Oh
you
thought
it
was
over
You
can
just
close
the
chapter
And
go
about
your
life
like
it
was
nothing
You
ruined
mine
but
you
seem
to
be
doing
fine
Id
never
recovered
but
tonight
I
betcha
that
whatcha
bout
to
go
throughs
tougher
than
anything
I
ever
have
suffered
Cant
think
of
a
better
way
to
define
poetic
justice
Can
I
hold
grudges
mind
is
saying:
let
it
go
fuck
this
Heart
is
saying:
I
will
once
I
bury
this
bitch
alive
Hide
the
shovel
and
then
drive
off
in
the
sunset
[Hook:
Sarah
Jaffe]
I
flee
the
scene
like
it
was
my
last
ride
You
see
right
through
oh
you
had
me
pegged
the
first
time
You
cant
see
the
truth
but
its
easier
to
justify
whats
bad
is
good
And
I
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
I
just
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
[Verse
2]
And
to
think
I
used
to
think
you
was
the
shit
bitch
To
think
it
was
you
at
one
time
I
worshipped
shit
Think
you
can
hurt
people
and
just
keep
getting
away
with
it
Not
this
time
you
better
go
and
get
sewing
kit
bitch
Finish
this
stitch
so
you
can
reap
what
you
sow
nitwit
Thought
some
time
had
past
and
I
forget
it
forget
it
You
left
our
family
in
shambles
You
expect
me
to
just
get
over
him
Pretend
he
never
existed
Maybe
gone
but
hes
not
forgotten
And
dont
think
cause
hes
been
out
the
pictures
so
long
That
Ive
stopped
the
plottin
and
still
aint
coming
to
get
ya
Youre
wrong
and
that
shit
was
rotten
And
the
way
you
played
him
same
shit
you
did
to
me
go
Have
you
any
idea
that
shit
Ive
gone
through
Feelings
I
harbor
all
this
pent
up
resentment
I
hold
on
to
Not
once
you
called
to
ask
me
how
Im
doing
Letters
you
dont
respond
to
em
Fuck
it
Im
coming
to
see
you
And
gee
who
better
to
talk
to
than
you
The
cause
of
my
problems
My
life
is
garbage
and
Im
bout
to
take
it
out
on
you
Poof
then
Im
gone
[Hook]
I
flee
the
scene
like
it
was
my
last
ride
You
see
right
through
oh
you
had
me
pegged
the
first
time
You
cant
see
the
truth
but
its
easier
to
justify
whats
bad
is
good
And
I
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
I
just
hate

be
the
bad
guy
[Verse
3]
Ive
been
driving
around
your
side
of
this
town
Like
9
frickin
hours
and
45
minutes
now
Finally
I
found
your
new
address
park
in
your
drive
Feel
like
I
been
waiting
on
this
moment
all
of
my
life
And
its
now
arrived
and
my
mouth
is
full
of
saliva
My
knife
is
out
and
Im
ducking
on
the
side
of
your
house
See
its
sad
it
came
to
this
point
Such
a
disappointment
I
had
to
make
this
appointment
to
come
and
see
ya
But
aint
here
for
ya
empathy
I
dont
need
your
apology
Or
your
friendship
of
sympathy
its
revenge
that
I
seek
So
I
sneak
vengefully
and
treat
your
bedroom
window
Like
I
reach
my
full
potential
I
peaked
Continue
to
peep
still
bent
low
Keep
tapping
the
glass
lightly
then
start
to
crescendo
Sneak
all
the
way
round
to
the
back
porch
Man
door
handles
unlocked
shouldnt
be
that
easy
to
do
this
You
dont
plan
for
intruders
before
hand
Surprised
to
see
me
Cat
got
your
tongue
Gag
chloroform
rag
gag
almost
hack
up
a
lung
Like
you
picked
up
an
axe
up
and
then
swung
Stick
to
the
core
plan
drag
to
the
back
of
a
trunk
By
one
of
your
fans
irony
spectacular
huh
Now
whos
a
faggot
you
punk
And
heres
your
Bronco
hat
you
can
have
that
shit
back
cause
they
suck
Its
just
me
you
and
the
music
now
Slim
I
hope
you
hear
it
we
are
in
a
car
right
now
Wait
here
comes
my
favorite
lyric
Im
the
bad
guy
who
makes
fun
of
people
that
die
And
hey
heres
a
sequel
to
my
Mathers
LP
Just
to
try
to
get
people
to
buy
Hows
this
for
publicity
stunt
This
should
be
fun
Last
album
now
cause
after
this
youll
be
officially
done
Eminem
killed
by
M&M
Matthew
Mitchell
bitch
I
even
have
your
initials
I
initially
was
gonna
bury
you
next
to
my
brother
but
fuck
it
Since
you
love
youre
city
so
much
I
figured
what
the
fuck
the
best
place
you
could
be
buried
alive
is
right
here
Two
more
exits
town
is
quite
near
I
hope
we
dont
get
stopped
no
license
I
fear
That
sirens
I
hear
Guess
90
on
the
freeway
wasnt
the
brightest
idea
As
cops
appear
in
my
driver
side
mirror
Oh
God
Police
Ah
Hope
foxtrot
gets
an
aerial
shot
of
your
burial
plot
at
least
New
plan
Stan
Slim
chauvinist
pig
drove
in
this
big
lincoln
town
car
Well
gotta
go
almost
at
the
bridge
haha
big
bro
its
for
you
Slim
this
is
for
him
and
Frank
Ocean
oh
hope
you
can
swim
good
Now
say
you
hate
homos
again
[Verse
4]
I
also
represent
anyone
on
the
receiving
end
of
those
jokes
you
offend
Im
the
nightmare
you
fell
asleep
in
and
woke
up
still
in
Im
your
karma
closing
in
with
each
stroke
of
a
pen
Perfect
time
to
have
some
remorse
to
show
for
your
sin
No
its
hopeless
Im
the
denial
that
youre
hopelessly
in
When
they
say
all
of
this
is
approaching
its
end
But
you
refuse
to
believe
that
its
over
here
we
go
all
over
again
Backs
to
the
wall
Im
stacking
up
all
them
odds
Toilets
clogged
Yeah
cause
Im
talking
a
lot
of
shit
but
Im
backing
it
all
up
But
in
my
head
theres
a
voice
in
the
back
and
it
hollas
After
the
track
is
demolished
I
am
your
lack
of
a
conscience
Im
the
ringing
in
your
ears
Im
the
polyps
on
the
back
of
your
tonsils
Eating
your
vocal
chords
after
your
concerts
Im
your
time
thats
almost
up
that
you
havent
acknowledged
Grab
for
some
water
but
Im
that
pill
thats
too
jagged
to
swallow
Im
the
bullies
you
hate
that
you
became
With
every
faggot
you
slaughtered
Coming
back
on
you
every
woman
you
insult
That
with
the
double-standards
you
have
when
it
comes
to
your
daughters
I
represent
everything
you
take
for
granted
Cause
Marshall
Mathers
the
rappers
personas
half
a
facade
And
Matthew
and
Stans
just
symbolic
of
you
not
knowing
what
you
had
until
its
gone
Cause
after
all
the
glitz
and
the
glam
no
more
fans
that
are
calling
your
name
Cameras
are
off
Sad
but
it
happens
to
all
of
them
Im
the
hindsight
to
say
I
told
you
so
Foreshadows
of
all
the
things
that
are
to
follow
Im
the
future
thats
here
to
show
you
what
happens
tomorrow
If
you
dont
stop
after
they
call
you
the
Biggest
laughing
stock
of
rap
who
cant
call
it
quits
When
its
time
to
walk
away
Im
every
guilt
trip
The
baggage
you
had
But
as
you
gather
up
all
your
possessions
If
theres
anything
you
have
left
to
say
Unless
it
makes
an
impact
dont
bother
So
before
you
rest
your
case
Better
make
sure
youre
packing
a
wallop
So
one
last
time
Im
back
Before
it
fades
into
black
and
its
all
over
Behold
the
final
chapter
in
the
saga
Trying
to
recapture
that
lightning
trapped
in
a
bottle
Twice
the
magic
that
started
it
all
Tragic
portrait
of
an
artist
tortured
Trapped
in
his
own
drawings
Tap
into
thoughts
Blacker
and
darker
than
anything
imaginable
Here
goes
a
wild
stab
in
the
dark
As
we
pick
up
the
last
Mathers
left
off
Skit
dont
kill
me
[shot]
Thank
you
[Eminem
running]
Go
go
go
what
the
fuck
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing
Mothafucker
bail
on
me
Fuck
you
[car
stop
working]
Aw
you
gotta
be
fucking
kidding
me
Are
you
fucking
kidding
me
Shit
Get
off
[shot
the
dog]
haha
[wheezing]
The
parking
lot
Shit
ah
Let
me
see
your
hands
pranks
over
Fuck
it
[Shoots
himself]
Whats
your
name
Marshall
Whos
your
daddy
I
dont
have
one
My
mother
reproduced
like
a
komodo
dragon
And
had
me
on
the
back
of
a
motorcycle
Then
crashed
in
the
side
of
loco-motive
with
rap
Im
loco
Its
like
handing
a
psycho
a
loaded
handgun
Michelangelo
with
a
paint
gun
in
a
tantrum
About
to
explode
all
over
the
canvas
Back
with
the
Yoda
of
rap
in
a
spasm
Your
music
usually
has
them
But
waned
for
the
game
your
enthusiasm
it
hasnt
Follow
you
must
Rick
Rubin
my
little
Padawan
A
Jedi
in
training
colossal
brain
and
thoughts
of
entertaining
But
docile
and
impossible
to
explain
and
Im
also
vain
and
Probably
find
a
way
to
complain
about
a
Picasso
painting
puke
Skywalker
but
sound
like
Chewbacca
when
I
talk
Full
of
such
blind
rage
I
need
a
seeing
eye
dog
Cant
even
find
the
page
I
was
writing
this
rhyme
on
oh
Its
on
a
rampage
couldnt
see
what
I
wrote
I
write
small
It
says
Ever
since
I
drove
a
79
Lincoln
with
white
walls
Had
a
fire
in
my
heart
and
a
dire
desire
to
aspire
to
DIE
HARD
So
as
long
as
Im
on
the
clock
punching
this
time
card
Hip
hop
aint
dying
on
my
watch
But
sometimes
when
Im
sleeping
she
comes
to
me
in
my
dreams
Is
she
taken
Is
she
mine
Dont
got
I
dont
care
dont
have
two
shits
to
give
Let
me
take
you
by
the
hand
to
promise
land
and
threaten
everyone
Cause
theres
no
rhyme
or
no
reason
for
nothing
Nah
Whats
your
name
Marshall
Whos
your
daddy
I
dont
know
him
but
I
wonder
Is
he
rich
like
me
Haha
Has
he
taken
any
time
to
show
to
show
you
what
you
need
to
live
[Verse
2]
No
If
he
had
he
wouldnt
have
ended
up
in
these
rhymes
on
my
pad
I
wouldnt
be
so
mad
my
attitude
wouldnt
be
so
bad
yeah
dad
Uh
The
epitome
and
the
prime
example
of
what
happens
When
the
power
of
the
rhyme
falls
into
the
wrong
hands
and
Makes
you
want
to
get
up
and
start
dancing
Even
if
it
is
Charles
Manson
who
just
happens
To
be
rapping
Blue
lights
flashing
laughing
all
the
way
to
the
bank
Lamping
in
my
K-Mart
mansion
Im
in
the
style
department
With
a
pile
in
my
car
ripping
the
isle
apart
With
great
power
comes
absolutely
no
responsiblity
for
content
Completely
despondent
and
conde-scen-ding
The
king
of
nonsense
and
contro-versy
in
on
a
Beat
killing
spree
your
honor
I
must
plea
Guil-ty
cause
I
sparked
a
Revolution
Rebel
without
a
cause
who
caused
the
evolution
of
rap
To
take
it
to
the
next
level
boost
it
But
several
rebuked
it
and
whoever
produced
it
Hip
hop
is
the
devils
music
Is
that
me
It
belongs
to
me
Cuz
I
just
happen
to
be
a
white
honky
devil
with
two
horns
That
dont
honk
but
every
time
I
speak
you
hear
a
beep
But
lyrically
I
never
hear
a
peep
not
even
a
whisper
Rappers
better
stay
clear
of
me
bitch
Cause
its
the
[Hook]
Its
the
time
of
the
season
when
hate
runs
high
And
this
time
give
it
to
you
easy
when
I
take
back
whats
mine
With
pleasured
hands
and
torture
everyone
that
is
my
plan
My
job
here
isnt
done
cause
theres
no
rhyme
or
no
reason
for
nothing
Whats
your
name
Shady
Whos
your
daddy
I
dont
give
a
fuck
but
I
wonder
Is
he
rich
like
me
Doubt
it
ha
Has
he
taken
any
time
to
show
you
what
you
need
to
live
[Verse
3]
So
yeah
dad
lets
walk
Lets
have
us
a
father
and
son
talk
But
I
bet
we
probably
wouldnt
get
one
block
Without
me
knocking
your
block
off
This
is
all
your
fault
Maybe
thats
why
Im
always
so
bananas
I
appeal
to
all
those
walks
of
like
Whoever
had
strife
Maybe
thats
what
dad
and
son
talks
are
like
Cause
I
related
to
the
struggles
of
[young]
America
When
their
fucking
parents
were
unaware
of
their
troubles
Now
theyre
ripping
out
their
fucking
hair
again
Its
a
stare
ruckle
I
chuckle
Cause
everybody
bloodies
their
bare
knuckles
Yeah
uh
oh
better
beware
knuckleheads
The
sound
of
my
hustle
says
dont
knock
The
doors
broken
it
wont
lock
It
might
just
fly
open
get
cold
cocked
You
critics
come
pay
me
a
visit
Misery
loves
company
please
stay
a
minute
Kryptonite
to
a
hypocrite
Zip
your
lip
if
you
dish
it
but
cant
take
it
Too
busy
getting
stoned
in
your
glass
house
To
kick
rocks
then
you
wonder
why
I
lash
out
Mister
Mathers
as
advertised
on
the
flyers
So
spread
the
word
cause
Im
promoting
my
passion
til
Im
passed
out
A
completely
brain
dead
Rainman
Doing
a
bankhead
in
a
restraint
chair
So
bitch
if
you
shoot
me
a
look
it
better
be
a
blank
stare
Or
get
shanked
in
the
pancreas
Im
angrier
than
All
8
of
the
reindeer
put
together
with
Chief
Keef
Cause
I
hate
every
fucking
thing
yeah
Even
this
rhyme
bitch
and
quit
tryna
look
For
a
fucking
reason
for
it
that
aint
there
But
I
still
am
a
CRIMINAL
Ten
year
old
degenerate
grabbing
on
my
genitals
The
last
Mathers
LP
that
went
diamond
This
time
Im
predicting
this
one
will
go
emerald
When
will
the
madness
end
how
can
it
when
Theres
no
method
the
pad
and
pen
The
only
message
that
I
have
to
sing
is:
Dad
Im
back
at
it
again
Bitch

1]
Pick

[Hook]
My
life
will
be
so
much
better
if
you

dead
dead
I
was
laying
in
bed
last
night
thinking
And
this
thought
just
popped
in
my
head
and
I
thought
Wouldnt
shit
just
be
a
lot
easier
if
you
dropped
dead
dead
I
would
feel
so
so
much
much
better
x3
[Verse
2]
Think
I
just
relapsed
this
bitch
pushed
me
over
the
brink
Hop
on
the
freeway
trying
to
get
some
time
alone
and
just
think
Then
the
cops
pulled
me
over
but
they
let
me
go
Cause
I
told
em
Im
only
driving
drunk
cause
that
bitch
drove
me
to
drink
Im
back
on
my
fuck
hos
But
a
whole
new
hatred
for
blondes
but
bias
I
hate
all
bitches
the
same
baby
come
on
Excuse
the
pun
but
bitch
youre
such
a
broad
statement
And
I
am
channeling
my
anger
through
every
single
station
its
on
Cause
a
woman
broke
my
he-art
I
say
he-art
cause
you
ripped
it
in
two
pa-arts
And
threw
it
in
the
garbage
who
do
you
think
you
are
Bitch
guess
its
time
for
me
to
get
the
dust
off
And
pick
myself
up
off
the
carpet
But
Ill
never
say
the
L-word
again
I
la-la-la-la
lesbian
shout
I
hope
you
hear
this
song
and
go
into
a
cardiac
arrest
My
life
would
be
so
much
better
if
you
just
[Hook]
My
life
will
be
so
much
better
if
you
dropped
dead
dead
I
was
laying
in
bed
last
night
thinking
And
this
thought
just
popped
in
my
head
and
I
thought
Wouldnt
shit
just
be
a
lot
easier
if
you
dropped
dead
dead
I
would
feel
so
so
much
much
better
x3
[Bridge]
Cuz

me

[Outro]
Im

[Hook:
Liz
Rodrigues]
This
is
survival
of
the
fittest
This
is
do
or
die
This
is
the
winner
takes
it
all
So
take
it
all
[Verse
1]
Wasnt
ready
to
be
no
millionaire
I
was
ill-prepared
I
was
prepared
to
be
ill
though
the
skill
was
there
From
the
beginning
it
wasnt
bout
the
ends
It
was
bout
busting
raps
and
standing
for
something
fck
an
acronym
Cut
the
fcking
act
like
youre
happy
Im
fcking
back
again
With
another
anthem
why
stop
when
it
doesnt
have
to
end
It
aint
over
til
I
say
its
over

enough
when
I
say
enough
Throw
me
to
the
wolves
and
close
the
gate
up
Im
afraid
of
whatll
happen
to
them
wolves
When
the
thought
of
being
thrown
into
an
alligator
pit
I
salivate
at
it
Weight
is
up
hands
up
like
its
12
noon
nah
homie
Hold
them
btches
straighter
up
wave
em
til
you
dislocate
a
rotator
cuff
Came
up
rough
came
to
ruffle
feathers
nah
egos
I
aint
deflate
enough
last
chance
to
make
this
whole
stadium
erupt
[Hook:
Liz
Rodrigues]
This
is
survival
of
the
fittest
This
is
do
or
die
This
is
the
winner
takes
it
all
So
take
it
all
[Verse
2]
I
can
see
the
finish
line
with
each
line
that
I
finish
Im
so
close
to
my
goals
I
can
almost
pole
vault
over
the
goal
post
And
if
I
dont
got
enough
in
the
tank
maybe
I
can
just
siphon
enough
To
fill
up
this
last
can
man
will
I
survive
in
this
climate
or
what
They
said
I
was
washed
up
and
got
a
blood
bath
Im
not
a
rapper
Im
an
adapter
I
can
adjust
Plus
I
can
just
walk
up
to
a
mic
and
just
bust
So
floors
open
if
youd
like
to
discuss
Top
5
in
this
mothafcka
and
if
I
dont
make
the
cut
What
like
I
give
a
fck
Ima
light
this
btch
up
like
Im
driving
a
truck
To
the
side
of
a
pump
0
to
60
hop
in
and
gun
it
Like
G-Unit
without
the
hyphen
Im
hyping
em
up
And
if
there
should
ever
come
a
time
where
my
lifes
in
a
rut
And
I
look
like
I
might
just
give
up
eh
you
mightve
mistook
Me
for
bowing
out
I
aint
taking
a
bow
Im
stabbing
myself
With
a
fcking
knife
in
the
gut
while
Im
wiping
my
butt
Cause
I
just
shtted
on
the
mic
and
I
like
getting
cut
I
get
excited
at
the
sight
of
my
blood
youre
in
a
fight
with
a
nut
Cause
Ima
fight
til
I
die
or
win
Biting
the
dust
itll
just
make
me
angrier
wait
Let
me
remind
you
of
what
got
me
this
far
picture
me
quitting
Now
draw
a
circle
around
it
and
put
a
line
through
it
slut
Its
survival
of
what
[Hook:
Liz
Rodrigues]
This
is
survival
of
the
fittest
This
is
do
or
die
This
is
the
winner
takes
it
all
So
take
it
all
[Verse
3]
So
get
your
ideas
stack
your
ammo
But
dont
come
unless
you
come
to
battle
Im
mad
now
jump
in
the
saddle
This
is
it
its
what
you
eat
sleep
piss
and
sht
Live
breathe
your
whole
existence
just
consists
of
this
Refuse
to
quit
fuse
is
lit
cant
diffuse
the
wick
I
dont
do
this
music
sht
I
lose
my
sht
Aint
got
sht
to
lose
its
the
moment
of
truth
Its
all
I
know
how
to
do
as
soon
as
I
get
thrown
in
the
booth
I
spit
But
my
respect
is
overdue
Im
showing
you
the
flow
no
one
do
Cause
I
dont
own
no
diploma
for
school
I
quit
So
theres
nothing
for
me
to
fall

I
know
no
other
trades
So
youd
better
trade
your
fcking
mics
in
for
some
tool-box-es
Cause
youll
never
take
my
pride
from
me
Itll
have
to
be
pried
from
me
so
pull
out
your
pliers
and
your
screw-drivers
But
I
want
you
to
doubt
me
I
dont
want
you
to
buh-lieve
Cause
this
is
something
that
I
must
use
to
suc-ceed
And
if
you
dont
like
me
then
fck
you
Self
es-teem
must
be
fcking
shooting
through-the-roof
cause
trust
me
My
skin
is
too
thick
and
bul-let
proof
to
touch
me
I
can
see
why
the
fck
I
disgust
you
I
must
be
a-llergic
to
failure
cause
every
time
I
come
close
to
it
I
just
sneeze
but
I
just
go
atchoo
then
achieve

This

This

it
all
So
take
it
all
[Intro:

Tell
me
where

Ill

Tell

I
used
to
be
the
type
of
kid
would
always
think
the
sky
is
falling
Why
am
I
so
differently
wired
Am
I
a
martian
What
kind
of
twisted
experiment
am
I
involved
in
Cause
I
dont
belong
in
this
world
Thats
why
Im
scoffing
at
authority
defying
often
Flying
off
at
the
handle
with
my
mom
no
dad
So
Im
non
complying
at
home
at
school
Im
just
shy
and
awkward
And
no
I
dont
need
no
goddamn
psychologist
Tryna
diagnose
why
I
have
all
these
underlying
problems
Thinking
he
can
try
and
solve
em
Im
outside
chalking
up
Drawings
on
the
sidewalk
and
in
the
front
drive
talking
to
myself
Either
that
or
inside
hiding
off
in
The
corner
somewhere
quiet
trying
not
to
be
noticed
Im
crying
and
sobbing
I
had
a
bad
day
at
school
so
I
aint
talking
Some
cocksucker
shoved
me
into
a
fucking
locker
cause
he
said
I
eyeballed
him
[Bridge]
And
if
you
fall
ill
get
you
there
Ill
be
your
savior
from
all
the
wars
That
are
fought
inside
your
world
please
have
faith
in
my
words
cause

I
used
to
be
the
type
of
kid
would
always
think
the
sky
is
falling
Why
am
I
so
differently
wired
in
my
noggin
Cause
sporadic
as
my
thoughts
come
its
mind
boggling
Cause
I
obsess
on
everything
and
my
mind
its
small
shit
Bothers
me
but
now
my
father
he
said
Sayonarathen
split
But
I
dont
give
a
shit
Im
fine
as
long
as
Theres
batteries
in
my
Walkman
nothing
is
the
matter
with
me
Shit
look
at
the
bright
side
at
least
I
aint
walking
I
bike
ride
through
the
neighborhood
of
my
apartment
Complex
on
a
ten
speed
which
Ive
acquired
parts
that
I
Found
in
the
garbage
a
frame
and
put
tires
on
it
Headphones
on
straight
ahead
and
kids
try
to
start
shit
But
if
this
all
there
is
for
me
Life
offers
Why
bother
even
try
and
put
up
a
fight
Its
nonsense
But
I
think
a
lightbulb
just
lit
up
in
my
conscience
What
about
those
rhymes
Ive
been
jottin
They
are
kinda
giving
me
confidence
Instead
of
tryina
escape
through
my
comics
Why
dont
I
just
blast
a
little
something
like
Onyx
To
put
me
in
the
mood
to
wanna
fight
and
write
songs
that
Say
what
I
wanna
say
to
the
kid
that
said
that
I
eyeballed
him
Grab
hold
of
my
balls
like
thats
right
fights
on
bitch
Who
wouldve
knew
from
the
moment
I
turned
the
mic
on
I
could
be
iconic
and
my
conquest
is
Word

Phife
Dawg

Tribe
Called

I
used

the
type
of
kid
that
would
always
think
the
sky
is
falling
Now
I
think
the
fact
that
Im

wireds
awesome
Cause
if
I
wasnt
I
wouldnt
be
able
to
work
Words
like
this
and
connect
lines
like
crosswords
And
use
my
enemys
words
as
strength
To
try
and
draw
from
and
get
inspired
off
em
Cause
all
my
life
I
was
told
and
taught
I
am
not
shit
By
you
wack
fucking
giant
sacks
of
lying
dog
shit
Now
you
shut

I

Me

Rawkus
You

Suck

The

Italian
sausage
The
most
high
exalting
and
I
aint
halting
Till
I
die
of
exhaustion
inhale
my

fumes
The

part
about

I

Legacy
[Verse:1]
Came
to
the
world
at
a
time
when
it
was
in
need
of
a
villain
An
asshole
that
role
I
think
I
succeed
in
fulfilling
Dont
think
I
ever
stopped
to
think
I
was
speaking
to
children
Everything
was
happening
so
fast
it
was
like
I
blinked
sold
three
million
Then
it
all
went
blank
all
I
remember
Is
feeling
ridiculous
cause
I
was
getting
sick
of
this
feeling
Like
I
am
always
under
attack
man
I
could
have
stacked
my
shit
list
to
the
ceiling
Women
dish
him
but
really
thinking
If
anyone
ever
talks
to
one
of
my
little
girls
like
this
I
would
kill
him
Guess
Im
a
little
bit
of
a
hypocrite
When
Im
ripping
shit
but
since
when
did
this
many
People
ever
give
a
shit
what
I
had
to
say
Its
just
my
opinion
If
it
contradicts
how
Im
living
Put
a
dick
in
your
rear
end
your
rear
end
thats
why
Every
time
you
mention
a
lyric
I
thank
you
for
it
For
drawing
more
attention
toward
it
Cause
it
gave
me
an
enormous
platform
of
platitude
Thought
I
was
that
important
But
you
cant
ignore
the
fact
that
I
fought
for
the
respect
And
battle
for
it
mad
awards

annoyed
Attaboy
they
told
me
to
slow
down
and
I
just
zone
out
Good
luck
trying
to
convince
a
blonde
Thats
like
telling
Gwen
Stefan
that
she
sold
out
Cause
I
was
tryna
leave
no
doubt
In
anyones
mind
one
day
Id

go
down
In
history
think
they
know
now

Because
everybody
knows
[Chorus
-
Skylar
Grey]
Everybody
knows
thatre
just
an
asshole
Everywhere
that
you
go
People
wanna
go
home
Everyone
knows
Everybody
knows
So
dont
pretend
to
be
nice
Theres
no
place
you
can
hide
You
are
just
an
asshole
Everyone
knows
Everyone
knows
[Verse
2]
Thanks
for
the
support
asshole
scratch
thanks
for
the
support
asshole
Quit
acting
salty
I
was
counting
on
you
to
count
me
out
as
Asher
Roth
When
he
round-a-bout
dissed
me
to
shout
me
out
Thought
I
was
history
But
goddamn
honkey
that
compliments
like
backhanding
a
donkey
Good
way
to
get
your
ass
socked
in
the
mouth
Layem
off
it
But
what
the
fuck
is
all
this
thrash
talking
about
The
fight
was
fixed
Im
back
and
you
cant
stop
me
You
knock
me
down
I
went
down
from
the
counter
I
fell
but
the
fans
caught
me
and
now
Youre
gonna
have
to
beat
the
fuckin
pants
off
me
To
take
my
belt
word
to
Pacquiao
Momma
said
there
aint
nothing
else
to
talk
about
Gotta
go
in
that
ring
and
knock
them
out
Or
you
better
not
come
out
Its
poetry
in
motion
like
Freddie
Roach
when
hes
quoting
Shakespeare
So
what
if
the
insults
are
revolting
Even
Helen
Keller
knows
life
stinks
You
think
its
a
joke
til
youre
bullet
riddled
But
you
should
give
little
shit
what
I
think
This
whole
world
is
a
mess
Gotta
have
a
goddamn
vest
on
your
chest
and
a
Glock
Just
to
go
out
watch
Batman
Who
needs
to
test
the
testicles
not
that
man
Half
of
you
dont
got
the
guts
and
intestinal
blockage
Rest
of
you
got
lap
bands
stuck
to
this
model
Before
they
put
bathsalts
and
all
those
water
bottles
in
Colorado
So
get
lost
Waldo
My
souls
escaping
through
this
asshole
that
is
gaping
A
black
hole
that
Im
swallowing
this
track
whole
With
a
pack
torn
of
paper
But
Im
not
taking
no
crap
ho
Here
I
go
down
the
back
pole
And
Im
changing
back
into
that
old
maniac
in
fact
there
it
go
Trying
to
dip
through
the
back
door
retreating
cause
everybody
knows
[Chorus
-
Skylar
Grey]
Everybody
knows
thatre
just
an
asshole
Everywhere
that
you
go
People
wanna
go
home
Everyone
knows
Everybody
knows
So
dont
pretend
to
be
nice
Theres
no
place
you
can
hide
You
are
just
an
asshole
Everyone
knows
Everyone
knows
[Verse
3]
Holy
mackeral
Im
the
biggest
jerk
on
the
planet
earth
I
smack
the
girl
off
the
mechanical
bull
then
attract
the
bull
Thinkin
we
have
some
magnetic
pull
Screamin
ICP
in
this
bitch
how
do
fucking
magnets
work
Cause
youre
attractive
but
we
aint
attractable
Hate
to
be
dramatical
but
Im
not
romantical
Im
making
up
words
you
can
understandable
Its
tragical
Thinkin
some
magical
shits
gonna
happen
That
aint
practical
You
crackin
a
joke
its
laughable
cause
me
and
loves
like
a
bad
combination
I
keep
them
feelings
locked
in
a
vault
So
its
safe
to
say
Im
uncrackable
My
heart
is
truly
guarded
full
body
armor
Bitch
you
just
need
a
helmet
because
if
you
think
youre
special
youre
retarded
Thinkin
youre
one
of
a
kind
like
you
got
some
platinum
vagina
youre
a
train
wreck
I
got
a
one
track
mind
Shorty
youre
fine
but
you
sort
of
remind
me
of
a
49er
Cause
you
been
a
gold
digger
since
you
were
a
minor
Been
tryina
hunt
me
down
like
a
dog
cause
youre
on
my
ass
But
you
cant
get
a
scent
because
all
of
my
spare
time
is
spent
With
my
nose
in
this
binder
so
dont
bother
tryin
Only
women
that
I
love
are
my
daughters
And
sometimes
I
rhyme
and
it
sounds
like
I
forget
Im
a
father
and
I
push
it
farther
So
father
forgive
me
if
I
forget
to
draw
the
line
Its
apparent
I
shouldnt
of
been
a
parent
Ill
never
grow
up
So
to
hell
with
your
parents
and
motherfucking
father
time
It
aint
never
gonna
stop
A
pessimist
who
transforms
you
to
Optimus
in
his
prime
so
even
if
Im
half
dead
Im
half
alive
Throw
all
my
half
empty
glass
in
a
cup
so
now
my
cup
is
runneth
over
And
Im
about
to
set
it
on
you
like
a
motherfucking
coaster
Im
goin
back
to
what
got
me
here
yeah

not
been
rude

my
dear

your
teardrops

White
Americas
mirror
so
I
feel
awkward
and
weird
you
stare
at
me
and
see
yourself
because
youre
one
too
You
shouldnt
be
as
shocked
because
everybody
knows
Now

the
bucket
Lifes
too
short
to
not
go
for
broke
So
everybody
everybody
get
your
vials
Look
I
was
gonna
go
easy
on
you
not
to
hurt
your
feelings
But
Im
only
going
to
get
this
one
chance
Somethings
wrong
I
can
feel
it
Six
minutes
Six
Minutes
Six
minutes
Slim
Shady
youre
on
Just
a
feeling
Ive
got
Like
somethings
about
to
happen
but
I
dont
know
what
If
that
means
what
I
think
it
means
Were
in
trouble
big
trouble
And
if
he
is
as
bananas
as
you
say
Im
not
taking
any
chances
You
are
just
what
the
doc
ordered
Im
beginnin
to
feel
like
a
Rap
God
Rap
God
All
my
people
from
the
front
to
the
back
nod
back
nod
Now
who
thinks
their
arms
are
long
enough
to
slap
box
slap
box
They
said
I
rap
like
a
robot
so
call
me
rap-bot
But
for
me
to
rap
like
a
computer
must
be
in
my
genes
I
got
a
laptop
in
my
back
pocket
My
penll
go
off
when
I
half-cock
it
Got
a
fat
knot
from
that
rap
profit
Made
a
livin
and
a
killin
off
it
Ever
since
Bill
Clinton
was
still
in
office
With
Monica
Lewinsky
feelin
on
his
nutsack
Im
an
MC
still
as
honest
But
as
rude
and
as
indecent
as
all
hell
Syllables
skill-a-holic
Kill
em
all
with
This
flippity
dippity-hippity
hip-hop
You
dont
really
wanna
get
into
a
pissin
match
with
this
rappity-rap
Packin
a
MAC
in
the
back
of
the
Ac
Backpack
rap
crap
yap-yap
yackety-yack
And
at
the
exact
same
time
I
attempt
these
lyrical
acrobat
stunts
while
Im
practicing
that
Ill
still
be
able
to
break
a
mothafuckin
table
Over
the
back
of
a
couple
of
faggots
and
crack
it
in
half
Only
realized
it
was
ironic
I
was
signed
to
Aftermath
after
the
fact
How
could
I
not
blow
All
I
do
is
drop
F-bombs
Feel
my
wrath
of
attack
Rappers
are
having
a
rough
time
period
heres
a
maxi
pad
Its
actually
disastrously
bad
for
the
wack
While
Im
masterfully
constructing
this
master
piece
Cause
Im
beginnin
to
feel
like
a
Rap
God
Rap
God
All
my
people
from
the
front
to
the
back
nod
back
nod
Now
who
thinks
their
arms
are
long
enough
to
slap
box
slap
box
Let
me
show
you
maintainin
this
shit
aint
that
hard
that
hard
Everybody
want
the
key
and
the
secret
To
rap
immortality
like
I
have
got
Well
to
be
truthful
the
blueprints
Simply
rage
and
youthful
exuberance
Everybody
loves
to
root
for
a
nuisance
Hit
the
Earth
like
an
asteroid
Did
nothing
but
shoot
for
the
Moon
since
Pew
MCs
get
taken
to
school
with
this
music
Cause
I
use
it
as
a
vehicle
to
bus
the
rhyme
Now
I
lead
a
new
school
full
of
students
Me
Im
a
product
of
Rakim
Lakim
Shabazz
2Pac
NWA
Cube
hey
Doc
Ren
Yella
Eazy
thank
you
they
got
Slim
Inspired
enough
to
one
day
grow

Blow

and
be
in
a
position
To
meet
RunDMC
and
induct
them
Into
the
mothafuckin
Rock
n
Roll
Hall
of
Fame
Even
though
Ill
walk
in
the
church
and
burst
in
a
ball
of
flames
Only
Hall
of
Fame
Ill
be
inducted
in
is
the
alcohol
of
fame
On
the
wall
of
shame
You
fags
think
its
all
a
game
til
I
walk
a
flock
of
flames
Off
a
plank
and
tell
me
what
in
the
fuck
are
you
thinkin
Little
gay-looking
boy
So
gay
I
can
barely
say
it
with
a
straight
face
looking
boy
Youre
witnessing
a
massacre
like
youre
watching
a
church
gathering
take
place
looking
boy
Oy
vey
that
boys
gay
thats
all
they
say
looking
boy
You
get
a
thumbs
up
pat
on
the
back
And
a
way
to
go
from
your
label
every
day
looking
boy
Hey
looking
boy
what
you
say
looking
boy
I
get
a
hell
yeah
from
Dre
looking
boy
Ima
work
for
everything
I
have
never
ask
nobody
for
shit
Get
outta
my
face
looking
boy
Basically
boy
youre
never
gonna
be
capable
Of
keeping
up
with
the
same
pace
looking
boy
Cause
Im
beginnin
to
feel
like
a
Rap
God
Rap
God
All
my
people
from
the
front
to
the
back
nod
back
nod
The
way
Im
racing
around
the
track
call
me
NASCAR
NASCAR
Dale
Earnhardt
of
the
trailer
park
the
White
Trash
God
Kneel
before
General
Zod
This
planets
Krypton
no
Asgard
Asgard
So
you
be
Thor
and
Ill
be
Odin
you
rodent
Im
omnipotent
Let
off
then
Im
reloadin
Immediately
with
these
bombs
Im
totin
And
I
should
not
be
woken
Im
the
walking
dead
But
Im
just
a
talking
head
a
zombie
floatin
But
I
got
your
mom
deep
throatin
Im
out
my
Ramen
Noodle
We
have
nothing
in
common
poodle
Im
a
Doberman
pinch
yourself
in
the
arm
And
pay
homage
pupil
Its
me
my
honestys
brutal
But
its
honestly
futile
if
I
dont
utilize
what
I
do
though
For
good
at
least
once
in
a
while
So
I
wanna
make
sure
somewhere
in
this
chicken
scratch
I
scribble
and
doodle
enough
rhymes
To
maybe
try
to
help
get
some
people
through
tough
times
But
I
gotta
keep
a
few
punchlines
Just
in
case
cause
even
you
unsigned
Rappers
are
hungry
looking
at
me
like
its
lunchtime
I
know
there
was
a
time
where
once
I
Was
king
of
the
underground
But
I
still
rap
like
Im
on
my
Pharoahe
Monch
grind
So
I
crunch
rhymes
but
sometimes
when
you
combine
Appeal
with
the
skin
color
of
mine
You
get
too
big
and
here
they
come
tryin
to
Censor
you
like
that
one
line
I
said
on
Im
Back
from
the
Mathers
LP
1
when
I
tried
to
say
Ill
take
seven
kids
from
Columbine
Put
em
all
in
a
line
add
an
AK-47
a
revolver
and
a
9
See
if
I
get
away
with
it
now
that
I
aint
as
big
as
I
was
but
Im
Morphin
into
an
immortal
coming
through
the
portal
Youre
stuck
in
a
time
warp
from
2004
though
And
I
dont
know
what
the
fuck
that
you
rhyme
for
Youre
pointless
as
Rapunzel
with
fucking
Cornrows
You
write
normal
Fuck
being
normal
And
I
just
bought
a
new
raygun
from
the
future
Just
to
come
and
shoot
ya
Like
when
Fabolous
made
Ray
J
mad
Cause
Fab
said
he
looked
like
a
fag
at
Mayweathers
pad
Singing
to
a
man
while
they
played
piano
Man
oh
man
that
was
a
24/7
special
on
the
cable
channel
So
Ray
J
went
straight
to
the
radio
station
The
very
next
day
Hey
Fab
Ima
kill
you
Lyrics
coming
at
you
at
supersonic
speed
JJ
Fad
Uh
summa-lumma
dooma-lumma
You
assuming
Im
a
human
What
I
gotta
do
to
get
it
through
to
you
Im
superhuman
Innovative
and
Im
made
of
rubber
So
that
anything
you
say
is
ricocheting
off
of
me
And
itll
glue
to
you
and
Im
devastating
more
than
ever
demonstrating
how
to
give
a
mothafuckin
audience
a
feeling
like
its
levitating
Never
fading
and
I
know
the
haters
are
forever
waiting
For
the
day
that
they
can
say
I
fell
off
theyll
be
celebrating
Cause
I
know
the
way
to
get
em
motivated
I
make
elevating
music
you
make
elevator
music
Oh
hes
too
mainstream
Well
thats
what
they
do
when
they
get
jealous
They
confuse
it
Its
not
hip-hop
its
pop
Cause
I
found
a
hella
way
to
fuse
it
With
rock
shock
rap
with
Doc
Throw
on
Lose
Yourself
and
make
em
lose
it
I
dont
know
how
to
make
songs
like
that
I
dont
know
what
words
to
use
Let
me
know
when
it
occurs
to
you
While
Im
ripping
any
one
of
these
verses
that
versus
you
Its
curtains
Im
inadvertently
hurting
you
How
many
verses
I
gotta
murder
to
Prove
that
if
you
were
half
as
nice
Your
songs
you
could
sacrifice
virgins
to
Ungh
school
flunky
pill
junkie
But
look
at
the
accolades
these
skills
brung
me
Full
of
myself
but
still
hungry
I
bully
myself
cause
I
make
me
do
what
I
put
my
mind
to
And
Im
a
million
leagues
above
you
Ill
when
I
speak
in
tongues
But
its
still
tongue-in-cheek
fuck
you
Im
drunk
so
Satan
take
the
fucking
wheel
Im
asleep
in
the
front
seat
Bumpin
Heavy
D
and
the
Boyz
still
Chunky
but
Funky
But
in
my
head
theres
something
I
can
feel
tugging
and
struggling
Angels
fight
with
devils
and
heres
what
they
want
from
me
Theyre
asking
me
to
eliminate
some
of
the
women
hate
But
if
you
take
into
consideration
the
bitter
hatred
I
have
Then
you
may
be
a
little
patient
and
more
sympathetic
To
the
situation
and
understand
the
discrimination
But
fuck
it
lifes
handing
you
lemons
Make
lemonade
then
But
if
I
cant
batter
the
women
How
the
fuck
am
I
supposed
to
bake
them
a
cake
then
Dont
mistake
him
for
Satan
its
a
fatal
mistake
If
you
think
I
need
to
be
overseas
And
take
a
vacation
to
trip
a
broad
And
make
her
fall
on
her
face
and
Dont
be
a
retard
be
a
king
Think
not
Why
be
a
king
when
you
can
be
a
God

I
walk
around
like
a
space
cadet
place
your
bets
Whos
likely
to
become
a
serial
killer
Case
of
tourettes
Fuck
fuck
fuck
Cant
take
the
stress
I
make
a
mess
as
the
day
progresses
Angry
and
take
it
out
on
the
neighbours
hedges
Like
this
is
how
Ill
cut
your
face
up
bitches
With
these
hedge
trimming
scisors
with
razor
edges
Imaginations
dangerous
its
the
only
way
to
escape
this
Mess
and
make
the
best
of
this
situation
I
guess
Cuz
I
feel
like
a
little
bitchs
predicaments
despicable
Im
sick
of
just
getting
pushed
its
ridiculous
I
look
like
a
freaking
wuss
a
pussy
This
kid
just
took
my
stick
of
liquorice
And
threw
my
sticker
books
in
a
picker
bush
I
wanna
kick
his
toosh
but
I
was
six
and
shook
This
fucker
was
12
and
was
6
foot
with
a
vicious
hook
He
hit
me
I
fell
I
got
back
up
all
I
did
was
book
now
theres
using
your
head
[Hook]
Mama

said
If
you

A

Mama
could
be

Mama
Ima
grow
a
name
and
be
famous
And
Imma
be
a
pain
in
the
anus
Mama
could
be
wrong
Imma
use
my
head
as
a

Find
a
way
to
escape
this
insaneness
Mama
always
said
Son
If
you

Guess
it

brainless
[Verse
2]
Fast
forward
some
years
later
A
teenager
this
is
a
fun
sweet
I
just
got
jumped
twice
in
one
week
its
complete
Its
usually
once
a
month
this
is
some
feat
Ive
accomplished
Theyve
stomped
me
into
the
mud
[gee]
for
what
reason
you
stomped
me
But
how
do
you
get
the
shit
beat
out
of
you
be
down
and
be
upbeat
When
you
dont
have
no-thing
no
valid
shot
at
life
Chance
To
make
it
or
succeed
Cuz
youre
doomed
from
the
start
Its
like
you
grew
up
on
drug
street
from
jump
street
But
if
I
had
just
kept
my
head
up
my
ass
I
could
accomplish
any
task
Practicing
trash
talking
in
a
trance
Locked
in
my
room
yeah
But
I
got
some
plans
mama
These
damn
rhymes
are
falling
Out
of
my
pants
pocket
I
cant
stop
it
And
Im
starting
to
blend
in
more
school
this
shit
helps
for
sure
Im
getting
more
self
assured
than
Ive
ever
been
before
Plus
no
one
picks
on
me
anymore
I
done
put
a
stop
to
that
Threw
my
first
punch
end
of
story
Still
in
my
skulls
a
vacant
empty
void
Been
using
it
more
as
a
bin
for
storage
Take
some
inventory
and
as
gorge
as
a
Ford
engine
door
hinge
syringe
an
orange
an
extension
cord
and
a
Ninja
sword
Not
to
mention
four
lynch
pins
and
a
stringent
stored
ironing
board
a
bench
a
wrench
or
winch
and
a
tangent
whore
Everything
but
a
brain
but
domes
off
the
fucking
chain
Like
an
independent
store
somethings
wrong
with
my
head
Just
think
if
I
had
a
brain
in
it
thank
God
that
I
dont
Cause
Id
probably
be
dahmer
cause

Cause
Im

smart
but
Im

I

bottom
of
the
pile
getting
stomped
But
somehow
I
came
out
on
top
[Verse
3]
I

Of

smart
alleck

Inappropriate

Maybe

Motherfuckin

Hopefully

Smoke

And

I
would
squeeze
and
youd
laugh
And
youd
tease
youre
just
fucking
with
me
And
you
must
hate
me
Why
do
you
date
me
if
you
say
I
make
you
sick
And
youve
had
enough
of
me
I
smother
you
Im
bout
to
jump
off
the
edge
[Hook]
But
you
wont
break
me
Youll
just
make
me
stronger
than
I
was
Before
I
let
you
I
bet
you
Ill
be
just
fine
without
you
And
if
I
stumble
I
wont
crumble
Ill
get
back
up
and
uhhh
And
Imma
still
be
humble
when
I
scream
fuck
you
Cause
Im
stronger
than
I
was
[Verse
2]
A
beautiful
face
is
all
that
you
had
Cause
on
the
inside
youre
ugly
man
But
youre
all
that
I
love
Aggressed
you
cant
leave
Please
stay
here
with
me
baby
hold
me
please
And
Id
beg
and
I
plead
drop
to
knees
And
Id
cry
and
Id
scream
baby
please
dont
leave
Cause
you
left
and
you
took
everything
I
had
left
And
left
nothing
nothing
for
me
So
please
dont
wake
me
from
this
dream
baby
Were
still
together
in
my
head
And
youre
still
in
love
with
me
Till
I
woke
up
to
discover
that
that
dream
was
dead
[Hook]
But
you
wont
break
me
Youll
just
make
me
stronger
than
I
was
Before
I
let
you
I
bet
you
Ill
be
just
fine
without
you
And
if
I
stumble
I
wont
crumble
Ill
get
back
up
and
uhhh
And
Imma
still
be
humble
when
I
scream
fuck
you
Cause
Im
stronger
than
I
was
[Verse
3]
You
walked
out
I
almost
died
It
was
almost
a
homicide
that
you
caused
cause
I
was
so
traumatized
Felt
like
I
was
in
for
a
long
bus
ride
Id
rather
die
than
you
not
be
by
my
side
Cant
count
how
many
times
I
vomited
cried
Go
to
my
room
turn
the
radio
on
and
hide
uh
We
were
Bonnie
and
Clyde
No
on
the
inside
you
were
Jekyll
and
Hyde
I
Felt
like
my
whole
relationship
with
you
was
a
lie
It
was
you
and
I
why
did
I
think
it
was
ride
or
die
Cause
if
you
couldve
took
my
life
you
wouldve
Its
like
you
put
a
knife
to
my
chest
and
pushed
it
right
through
to
the
Other
side
of
my
pack
and
stuck
a
spike
too
shouldve
Put
up
more
of
a
fight
but
I
couldnt
at
the
time
No
one
could
hurt
me
like
you
couldve
Take
you
back
now
whats
the
likelihood
of
that
Bite
me
bitch
chewing
on
a
nineteen
footer
Cause
this
morning
I
finally
stood
up
Held
my
chin
up
finally
showed
a
sign
of
life
in
me
for
the
First
time
since
you
left
me
and
left
me
with
nothing
but
shattered
dreams
And
a
life
we
couldve
had
and
we
couldve
been
But
Im
breaking
out
of
this
slump
Im
in
Pulling
myself
out
of
the
dumps
once
again
Im
getting
up
once
and
for
all
fuck
this
shit
Imma
be
late
for
the
pity
party
But
youre
never
gonna
beat
me
to
the
fucking
punch
again
Took
it
on
the
chin
like
a
champ
so
dont
lump
me
in
with
the
chumpy
ends
Im
done
being
your
punching
bag
It
was
the
November
31st
today
wouldve
been
our
anniversary
Two
years
but
you
left
on
the
first
of
May
I
wrote
it
on
the
calender
was
gonna
call
but
couldnt
think
of
the
words
to
say
But
it
came
to
me
just
now
so
I
put
em
in
a
verse
to
lay
And
I
thank
you
cause
you
made
me
a
better
person
than
I
was
But
I
hate
you
cause
you
drained
me
I
gave
you
all
you
gave
me
none
But
if
you
blame
me
youre
crazy
And
after
all
thats
said
and
done
Im
still
angry
yeah
I
maybe
I
may
never
trust
someone
[Hook]
But
you
wont
break
me
Youll
just
make
me
stronger
than
I
was
Before
I
let
you
I
bet
you
Ill
be
just
fine
without
you
And
if
I
stumble
I
wont
crumble
Ill
get
back
up
and
uhhh
And
Imma
still
be
humble
when
I
scream
fuck
you
Cause
Im
stronger
than
I
was
Im
friends
with
the
monster
Thats
under
my
bed
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
Youre
trying
to
save
me
Stop
holding
your
breath
And
you
think
Im
crazy
Yeah
you
think
Im
crazy
crazy
I
wanted
the
fame
but
not
the
cover
of
Newsweek
Oh
well
guess
beggers
cant
be
choosey
Wanted
to
receive
attention
for
my
music
Wanted
to
be
left
alone
in
public
excuse
me
Been
wanting
my
cake
And
eat
it
too
And
wanting
it
both
ways
Fame
made
me
a
balloon
cause
my
ego
inflated
When
I
blew
seep
and
it
was
confusing
Cause
all
I
wanted
to
do
is
be
the
Bruce
Lee
of
loose
leaf
Abused
ink
used
it
as
a
tool
when
I
blew
steam
Hit
the
lottery
oh
wee
With
what
I
gave
up
to
get
was
bittersweet
It
was
like
winning
a
huge
meet
Ironic
cause
I
think
Im
getting
so
huge
I
need
a
shrink
Im
beginning
to
lose
sleep:
one
sheep
two
sheep
Going
cuckoo
and
cookey
as
Kool
Keith
But
Im
actually
weirder
than
you
think
Cause
Im
Im
friends
with
the
monster
Thats
under
my
bed
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
Youre
trying
to
save
me
Stop
holding
your
breath
And
you
think
Im
crazy
Yeah
you
think
Im
crazy
Well
thats
nothing
oh
oh
oh
oh
Well
thats
nothing
oh
oh
oh
oh
Now
I
aint
much
of
a
poet
But
I
know
somebody
once
told
me
to
seize
the
moment
And
dont
squander
it
Cause
you
never
know
when
it
could
all
be
over
Tomorrow
so
I
keep
conjuring
Sometimes
I
wonder
where
these
thoughts
spawn
from
Yeah
ponder
it
do
you
want
this
theres
no
wonder
youre
losing
your
mind
the
way
youre
wandering
I
think
youve
been
wandering
off
down
yonder
and
stumbled
onto
Jeff
VanVonderen
Cause
I
needed
an
interventionist
to
intervene
between
me
and
this
monster
And
save
me
from
myself
and
all
this
conflict
Cause
the
very
thing
that
I
love
is
killing
me
and
I
cant
conquer
it
My
OCD
is
conking
me
in
the
head
Keep
knocking
nobodys
home
Im
sleepwalking
Im
just
relaying
what
the
voice
in
my
head
saying
Dont
shoot
the
messenger
Im
just
friends
with
the
Im
friends
with
the
monster

under
my
bed

of
my

Stop
holding
your

Call

this
vision
One

But

Im
Coming

and
I
Take
it
back
to
the

Give

at
Pumped
the
feeling
and
shit
to
say

To
the
kids
who
played
em
I

But

of

hundred
million
Who
are
going
through
a
struggle
feels
and
it
relates
thats
great
Its
payback
Russell

In

nothing
into
something

make
that
Straw

the
gold
chump

hay
stack
Maybe

Gotta

and
only
option
I

In

So

Told

end
Cant

my
ass
without

an
accident
Puff

my
blessings
but
I
suck

math
Id

wallow
then
bass
suffering
from
succotash
But
the
antacid

my
stomach
gas
I
mix
my
corn
with

Stuck

[Hook]
Maybe
thats
why
I
feel
so
strange
Got
it
all
but
I
still
wont
change
Maybe
thats
why
I
cant
leave
Detroit
Its
the
motivation
that
keeps
me
going
This
is
the
inspiration
I
need
I
can
never
turn
my
back
on
a
city
that
made
me
Lifes
been
good
to
me
so
far
[Verse

You

Fuck
I

Be

sandwich
with
welchs

belch
They

my
health
but
I

more
white
trash
from
the
trailer
Jed
Clampett
Redd
Sanford
welfare
mentality
helps
to
Keep
me
grounded
thats
why
I
never
take
full
advantage
of
wealth
I
Managed
to
dwell
within
these
parameters
Still
cramming
the
shelves
full
of
hamburger
helper
I
cant
even
help
it
this
is
the
hand
I
was
dealt
to
Creature
of
habit
feel
like
Im
trapped
in
an
animal
shelter
With
all
these
pet
peeves
God
dammit
to
hell
I
cant
stand
all
these
kids
with
their

cellphones
I
cant
go
anywhere
I

so
mad
I
can
yell
the
Other

elaborate
and
stuck
a
fucking
dead
cat
in
my
mailbox
Went
to
Burger
King
they
spit
on
my
onion
rings
I
think
my
karma
is
catching
up
with
me
[Hook]
Maybe
thats
why
I
feel
so
strange
Got
it
all
but
I
still
wont
change
Maybe
thats
why
I

Detroit
Its

I

all
cracked
[Verse

Im
trying
to
be
lowkey
hopefully
nobody
notices
me
In
produce
hunched
over
giant
nosebleed
Over

By

Embarrassed

They

The
pressure

me
to
follow

Hopping

so
strange
Got

Maybe
thats
why

[Verse
1
-
Eminem]
Somethins
burnin
I
cant
figure
out
what
Its
either
lust
or
a
cloud
of
dust
Judgement
is
clouded
must
just
be
the
powder
from
the
power
of
love
But
Im
in
somethin
I
dont
know
how
to
get
out
of
Left
my
girl
in
the
house
alone
Is
that
my
soon
to
be
spouses
moan
And
the
further
I
walked
allowed
her
I
paused
for
a
minute
to
make
something
thats
what
I
heard
Cuz
after
all
this
is
her
place
So
I
gave
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
Think
I
might
be
about
Busta
Busta
The
thoughts
so
scary
yo
that
it
hurts
brace
Hope
it
aint
there
we
go
yo
Cause
my
head
already
goes
to
worst
case
scenario
though
in
the
first
place
But
you
confirmed
my
low
end
theory
though
Shouldve
known
when
I
made
it
all
the
way
to
third
base
And
that
was
only
the
first
date
coulda
made
it
to
home
plate
But
you
slid
straight
for
the
dome
and
dove
face
first
No
you
dont
under
stand
I
dont
do
this
for
Anyone
ever
Yeah
that
aint

She

[Verse
3:
Eminem]
So
needless
to
say
Im
feeling
betrayed
Snatched
my
housekey
off
my
keychain
She
jumped
off
Wee-Bey
from
The
Wire
escape
Now
shes
chasin
me
with
a
cheese
grater
Here
goes
that
broken
record
cliche
its
all
my
fault
anyway
Shes
turnin
the
tables
Im
a
beat-break
Treats
my
face
like
seratos
she
cuts
and
scratches
like
a
DJ
Each
day
is
an
instant
replay
They
sayin
we
display
cinethematic
abatic
behavior
Back
together
but
forgot
today
was
her
b-day
cut
me
off
on
the
freeway
Simple
misunderstandin
but
just
as
I
went
to
slam
on
the
brakes
Then
I
realized
that
she
may
be
as
crazy
as
me
wait
Bitch
cut
my
fuckin
brakeline
stepped
on
them
fuckers
8
times
Still
goin
73
thank
God
theres
an
exit
coming
up
But
them
other
F-U-C-Ks
all
would
of
hit
the
off
ramp
So
I
coast
into
a
gosh
damned
aww
hit
a
fuckin
tree
Now
here
she
comes
at
full
speed
shes
racin
at
me
Okay
you
wanna
fuck
with
me
eh
Snatch
the
bitch
out
her
car
through
the
window
she
screamin
I
body
slam
her
onto
the
cement
until
the
concrete
gave
and
created
a
sinkhole
Bury
this
stink
ho
in
it
then
payed
to
have
the
street
re-paved
Fuck
woke
up
in
a
dream
state
in
a
cold
sweat
Like
I
got
hit
with
a
freeze
ray
durin
a
heat
wave
Guess
I
eventually
caved
though
cause
shes
layin
next
to
me
in
bed
Directly
aimin
a
gat
at
my
head
Woke
up
again
and
jumped
up
like
fuck
it
Ive
had
it
Im
checkin
into
rehab
I
confess
Im
a
static
addict
I
guess
thats
why
Im
so
clingy
Every
girl
Ive
ever
had
either
says
I
got
to
much
baggage
Or
Im
just
too
dramatic
Man
what
the
fuck
is
the
matter
Im
just
a
fucking
romantic
I
fucking
love
you
you
fucking
bitch
Combative
possessive
in
fact
last
time
I
was
mad
at
an
ex
I
actually
set
off
a
chain
reaction
a
tragic
event
I
said
hit
the
road
and
after
she
left
I
sent
that
bitch
a
text
I
said
be
careful
driving
dont
read
this
and
have
a
accident
She
glanced
to
look
at
it
and
write
too
bad
Thought
we
had
a
connect
No
sense
dwelling
makes
never
been
a
more
compelling
case
Than
a
model
covered
in
LOreal
and
mace
who
fell
from
grace
Eleven
stories
for
story
telling
but
the
whore
was
yelling
rape
So
the
vocal
cords
were
swelling
And
her
voice
were
more
hoarser
than
Tori
Spellings
face
Still
they
swarm
the
gates
and
my
fans
making
stakes
To
greet
Norman
Bates
with
a
warm
embrace
Unless
youre
Andrea
Yates
dont
ask
me
for
a
date
dont
be
late
Well
the
sentiments
great
but
wait
then
theres
been
a
mistake
You
want
an
intimate
date
I
wanna
intimidate
I
have
infinite
hate
in
my
blood
its
mainly
because
of
the
game
of
Wait
dinner
at
eight
I
have
infinite
hate
in
my
blood
its
mainly
because
of
the
game
of
Love
love
love
love
L-l
l-l-l-love
Mom
I
know
I
let
you
down
And
though
you
say
the
days
are
happy
Why
is
the
power
off
and
Im
fucked
up
And
mom
I
know
hes
not
around
But
dont
you
place
the
blame
on
me
As
you
pour
yourself
another
drink
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
I
went
in
headfirst
Never
thinking
about
who
what
I
said
hurt
in
what
verse
My
mom
probably
got
it
the
worst
The
brunt
of
it
but
as
stubborn
as
we
are
Did
I
take
it
too
far
Cleaning
out
my
closet
and
all
them
other
songs
But
regardless
I
dont
hate
you
cause
ma
Youre
still
beautiful
to
me
cause
youre
my
mom
Though
far
be
it
for
you
to
be
calling
my
house
was
Vietnam
Desert
Storm
and
both
of
us
put
together
can
form
an
atomic
bomb
Equivalent
to
Chemical
warfare
And
forever
we
can
drag
this
on
and
on
But
agree
to
disagree
That
gift
from
me
up
under
the
Christmas
tree
dont
mean
shit
to
me
Youre
kicking
me
out
Its
15
degrees
and
its
Christmas
Eve
little
prick
just
leave
ma
let
me
grab
my
fucking
coat
Anything
to
have
each
others
goats
why
we
always
at
each
others
throats
Especially
when
dad
he
fucked
us
both
Were
in
the
same
fucking
boat
Youd
think
that
itd
make
us
close
nope
Further
away
that
drove
us
but
together
headlights
shine
A
car
full
of
belongings
Still
got
a
ways
to
go
back
To
grandmas
House
its
straight
up
the
road
And
I
was
the
man
of
the
house
the
oldest
So
my
shoulders
carried
the
weight
Of
the
load
Then
Nate
got
taken
away
by
the
state
at
8
years
old
and
Thats
when
I
realized
you
were
sick
and
it
wasnt
fixable
or
changable
And
to
this
day
we
remained
estranged
and
I
hate
it
though
but
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
Cause
to
this
day
we
remain
estranged
and
I
hate
it
though
Cause
you
aint
even
get
to
witness
your
grand
babys
growth
But
Im
sorry
mama
for
Cleaning
Out
My
Closet
at
the
time
I
was
angry
Rightfully
maybe
so
never
meant
that
far
to
take
it
though
cause
Now
I
know
its
not
your
fault
and
Im
not
making
jokes
That
song
I
no
longer
play
at
shows
and
I
cringe
every
time
its
on
the
radio
And
I
think
of
Nathan
being
placed
in
a
home
And
all
the
medicine
you
fed
us
And
how
I
just
wanted
you
to
taste
your
own
but
Now
the
medications
taken
over
and
your
mental
states
deteriorating
slow
And
Im
way
too
old
to
cry
that
shits
painful
though
But
ma
I
forgive
you
so
does
Nathan
yo
All
you
did
all
you
said
you
did
your
best
to
raise
us
both
Foster
care
that
cross
you
bare
few
may
be
as
heavy
as
yours
But
I
love
you
Debbie
Mathers
oh
what
a
tangled
web
we
have
cause
One
thing
I
never
asked
was
where
the
fuck
my
deadbeat
dad
was
Fuck
it
I
guess
he
had
trouble
keeping
up
with
every
address
But
Id
have
flipped
every
mattress
every
rock
and
desert
cactus
Own
a
collection
of
maps
and
followed
my
kids
to
the
edge
of
the
atlas
Someone
ever
moved
them
from
me
That
you
could
bet
your
asss
If
I
had
to
come
down
the
chimney
dressed
as
Santa
kidnap
them
And
although
one
has
met
their
grandma
Once
you
pulled
up
in
our
drive
one
nights
As
we
were
leaving
to
get
some
hamburgers
Me
her
and
Nate
we
introduced
you
hugged
you
And
as
you
left
I
had
this
overwhelming
sadness
come
over
me
As
we
pulled
off
to
go
our
separate
paths
and
I
saw
your
headlights
as
I
looked
back
And
Im
mad
I
didnt
get
the
chance
to
thank
you
for
being
my
Mom
and
my
Dad
So
Mom
please
accept
this
as
a
tribute
I
wrote
this
on
the
jet
I
guess
I
had
to
get
this
off
my
chest
I
hope
I
get
the
chance
to
lay
it
before
Im
dead
The
stewardess
said
to
fasten
my
seatbelt
I
guess
were
crashing
So
if
Im
not
dreaming
I
hope
you
get
this
message
That
Ill
always
love
you
from
afar
cause
youre
my
mama
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
I
want
a
new
life
one
without
a
cause
So
Im
coming
home
tonight
well
no
matter
what
the
cost
And
if
the
plane
goes
down
and
if
the
crew
cant
wake
me
up
Just
know
that
I
was
alright
and
I
was
not
afraid
to
die
Even
if
theres
songs
to
sing
my
children
will
carry
me
Just
know
that
Im
alright
I
was
not
afraid
to
die
Because
I
put
my
faith
in
my
new
girl
so
I
never
say
goodbye
cruel
world
Just
know
that
Im
alright
I
am
not
afraid
to
die
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
I
want
a
new
life
[Intro]
Yeah
trying
to
figure
out
the
difference
But
I
think
I
think
the
lines
are
starting
to
get
blurry
[Verse
1]
Im
in
a
strange
place
I
feel
like
Mase
when
he
gave
up
the
game
for
his
faith
I
feel
like
Im
caged
in
these
chains
and
restraints
Grinning
every
stranger
in
the
place
while
I
gaze
into
space
Cause
Im
mentally
rearranging
his
face
I
need
a
change
of
pace
cause
the
pace
Im
working
at
is
dangerous
Theres
nowhere
to
dump
this
anger
and
thanks
to
this
angst
I
done
quit
chicken
heads
in
cold
turkey
and
started
slowly
roasting
em
Cause
thats
where
most
of
my
anger
is
based
Fuck
your
feelings
I
feel
like
I
play
for
the
Saints
I
just
want
to
hurt
you
aim
for
the
skanks
Then
aim
for
all
these
fake
Kanyes
Jays
Waynes
and
the
Drakes
Im
frustrated
cause
aint
no
more
NSync
now
Im
all
out
of
wack
Im
all
out
of
Backstreet
Boys
to
call
out
and
attack
Im
going
all
out
in
this
rap
shit
and
whatever
the
fallout
is
Im
strapped
for
battles
suck
a
duck
crawl
out
the
back
bar
fight
Prepare
your
arsenal
and
beware
of
bar
stools
flying
through
the
air
And
bottles
breaking
mirrors
also
And
I
aint
stopping
til
the
swear
jars
full
You
done
called
every
woman
a
slut
but
you
forgetting
Sarah
Marshall
Palin
Oh
my
bad
slut
And
next
time
I
show
up
in
court
Ill
be
naked
and
square
a
lawsuit
Judge
be
like
thats
sharp
how
much
that
motherfucker
cost
you
Smart
ass
you
lucky
I
dont
tear
it
off
you
And
jmp
your
bones
you
sexy
motherfucker
You
so
fucking
gravy
Marshall
I
should
start
calling
you
au
jus
Cause
all
you
do
is
spit
them
lyrics
out
the
wazoo
Evil
twin
take
this
beat
now
its
on
you
I
believe
people
can
change
but
only
for
the
worse
I
couldve
changed
the
world
if
it
wasnt
for
this
verse
So
satanic
K-Mart
chains
panic
Cause
they
cant
even
spin
back
the
curse
words
Cause
theyre
worse
when
theyre
reversed
motherfucker
I
fuck
em
-
rape
your
mother
And
these
kids
are
like
parrots
They
run
around
the
house
just
like
terrorists
Screaming
fuck
shit
fuck
Adult
with
a
childish
like
arrogance
Wild
ever
since
the
day
I
came
out
I
was
like
merits
fuck
that
Id
rather
be
loud
and
I
like
swearing
From
the
first
album
even
the
gals
were
like
tight
lyrics
dreamy
eyes
But
my
fucking
mouth
was
nightmare-ish
And
from
the
start
of
it
you
felt
like
you
were
a
part
of
this
And
the
opposition
felt
the
opposite
Sometimes
I
listen
and
revisit
them
old
albums
Often
as
I
can
and
skim
through
all
them
bitches
To
make
sure
I
keep
up
with
my
competition
Hogger
of
beats
hoarder
of
rhymes
Borderline
genius
whos
bored
of
his
lines
And
that
sort
of
defines
where
Im
at
and
the
way
I
feel
now
Feel
like
I
might
just
strike
first
and
ignore
the
replies
[Hook]
This
darkness
comes
in
me
Evil
twin
And
comes
again
That
aint
me
Hes
just
a
friend
who
pops
up
now
and
again
So
dont
blame
me
blame
him
I
step
out
and
see
my
evil
twin
he
gives
me
an
evil
grin
[Interlude]
Welcome
back
to
the
land
of
the
living
my
friend
You
have
slept
for
quite
some
time
[Verse
2]
So

Feel

Bed

Bedroom

was
definite
lean
My
destiny

on
the

Deshaun

to
skip

to
mop
floors
Flip
burgers
and
wash
dishes
but
I
wrote
rhymes
trying
to
get
props
for
em
Cause
I
took
book-smarts
and
swapped
for
em
They
was
sleeping
I
made
them
stop
snorin
Made
them
break
out
the
popcorn
Now
Ive
been
hip
hop
in
its
tip
top
form
Since
NWA
was
blaring
through
my
car
windows
leaning
on
the
horn
Screaming
fuck
the
police
like
cop
porn
Flipped
rap
on
its
ear
like
I
dropped
corn
Fuck

Two

And

Guess

That
I
should
call

I
wish

Into

Britney
Oh

Slow

You

to
hold
hands

your
homie
What
You

Im
looking
for
romance
cause
Im
lonely
Change
that
tune
you
aint
got
remote
chance
to
control
me
Ho
Im
only
vulnerable
when
I
got
a
boner
Superman
tried
to
fuck
me
over
it
wont
hurt
Dont
try
to
fix
me
Im
broke
so
I
dont
work
So
are
you
but
youre
broke
cause
you
dont
work
But
all
bullshit
aside
I
hit
a
stride
Still
Shady
inside
hair
every
bit
is
dyed
As
it
used
to
be
when
I
first
introduced
yall
to
my
skittish
side
And
blamed
it
on
him
when
they
tried
to
criticize
Cause
we
are
the
same
bitch
[Verse
1]
One
thousand
different
houses
and
munchausen
Imma
make
you
wanna
punch
out
some
fuckin
one
ouch
What
the
fuckd
you
hit
me
for
Scream
life
as
I
punch
counter
and
bunches
out
of
anger
I
once
encountered
a
stranger
In
a
dumb
gown
black
hood
With
a
scythe
Shit
I
laughed
in
his
face
spit
Bitch
gave
me
an
extra
life
like
take
this
Now
get
your
ass
back
in
that
game
Bitch
dont
take
shit
for
granted
And
dont
take
shit
give
it
Only
bull
you
should
take
is
by
the
horns
A
mixture
of
Whitey
Ford
and
mighty
Thor
I
Everlast
pen
is
mightier
than
sword
Finish
writing
then
record
Replenish
keep
writing
more
Nothings
riding
on
it
but
your
privates
are
youre
fighting
for
So
you
fight
scratch
you
claw
Backs
to
wall
No
one
was
there
to
catch
you
fall
You
pick
yourself
back
up
you
dust
your
jacket
off
You
grab
your
balls
like
theyre
gargantuan
and
Ask
yourself
how
fucking
bad
you
want
it
Pull
out
your
pants
whoop
your
ass
and
flash
it
on
em
Nobodies
gonna
back
you
in
the
corner
Throw
a
hornet
No
ones
more
ig-norant
then
you
fuckin
four
in
the
morning
youre
at
the
laboratory
storming
Like
theres
nothing
thats
more
important
MCs
you
better
consider
this
a
formal
warning
youre
in
for
it
Girl
what
would
you
do
if
I
said
your
body
was
off
the
chain
And
I
told
you
I
smile
every
single
time
I
saw
your
face
I
aint
finished
bitch
I
meant
in
half
oil
the
blades
Nobody
wants
to
play
They
say
Im
a
spoiled
little
baby
But
[Hook]
Nobody
puts
baby
in
the
corner
Im
only
trying
to
warn
ya
Cus
that
baby
gets
mad
And
gets
to
throwing
a
tantrum
Hell
fucking
flip
on
ya
Cus
nobody
puts
baby
in
the
corner
Im
only
trying
to
warn
ya
Cus
that
baby
gets
mad
And
gets
to
throwing
a
tantrum
Hell
fucking
flip
on
ya
[Verse
2]
What
goes
through
an
addicts
brain
Besides
static
pain
and
big
daddy
kane
Break
beats
and
words
An
erratic
train
of
thought
Like
splatter
paint
Scatter
brain
Yeah
maybe
why
that
explains
Why
youre
back
but
you
dont
rap
the
same
And
youre
looking
way
thinner
Because
your
hunger
got
you
looking
like
They
took
away
dinner
Sugar
ray
leonard
wouldnt
sugar
coat
a
fucking
booger
though
Just
to
wipe
that
bitch
on
a
hookers
coat
When
you
say
youre
a
chooka
what
chooka
what
Now
fling
that
bitch
from
your
fingertips
I
hope
it
lands
on
another
rap
singers
lips
Who
cant
think
of
shit
Anything
of
wit
thats
interesting
to
spit
Whose
king
of
this
fucking
English
Lit
Let
your
middle
fingers
flip
On
each
hand
whilst
extending
this
shit
How
low
can
you
go
Lower
then
Chuck
D
ho
Hear
the
bass
of
this
in
my
voice
Rockys
back
wheres
my
Adrian
Nobodies
crazy
as
shady
in
an
eighty
million
mile
radius
Im
what
Tom
Brady
is
to
the
patriots
of
rap
Not
a
man
Im
a
weapon
Who
just
happened
to
be
a
rapper
Who
just
happen
to
be
on
the
crapper
When
it
happened
I
had
an
epiphany
In
the
bathroom
Id
never
be
the
same
after
Now
Im
back
with
an
apper-tite
For
destruction
the
fucking
recipe
for
disaster
So
lets
eat
cos
Im
famished
Every
deed
is
a
dastardly
one
Evil
its
past
it
Even
you
asking
for
me
to
be
pulled
Like
to
people
Is
like
me
having
my
teeth
pulled
[Hook]
[Verse
3]
So
step
inside
of
dimension
The
demented
side
of
a
mind
Thats
like
the
inside
of
an
engine
While
I
multiply
your
undivided
attention
But
be
reminded
that
if
I
didnt
mention
I
lose
my
mind
and
my
temper
Youll
be
the
first
one
Who
finds
him
offensive
Got
him
climbing
the
fences
Lost
some
time
to
addiction
But
look
up
rhyme
in
the
dictio-nary
Im
in
the
picture
Eminem
is
the
synonym
for
it
Im
an
enigma
Fuck
it
lets
get
to
the
meat
balls
Im
gonna
skip
the
veg
and
potatoes
Edgamacater
they
are
Shit
legends
are
madea
Spit
treachreous
data
Shit
that
you
would
say
to
your
worst
enemy
This
wretchedness
is
What
you
get
when
you
mix
Treach
with
a
Jada
And
combine
em
with
Method
Man
and
Redman
Whit
meth-amphetamines
in
his
left
hand
And
in
his
right
theres
a
sledge-hammer
And
pajamas
standing
in
front
of
a
webcam
Beating
himself
in
the
head
til
Russell
lets
him
off
dead
jam
Maybe
I
need
my
head
examined
Hannibal
Lecter
with
a
dead
lamb
Hanging
from
his
ceiling
dripping
with
a
bed
pan
I
need
meds
Swear
to
god
cus
If
I
go
off
the
edge
TI
aint
talking
me
off
a
ledge
man
Heart
throb
at
a
fart
ah
nah
More
like
a
smart
slob
part
blob
Thatll
stab
you
with
a
sharp
ob-ject
To
the
heart
and
leave
claw
marks
All
over
the
Wal-Mart
walls
Little
baby
with
large
balls
Fuck
mud
slinging
Im
blood
flinging
Theres
nothing
on
this
fucking
earth
better
then
being
King
of
the
playground
I
hate
the
swings
but
I
love
being
the
underdog
Cos
when
Im
pushed
I
end
up
swinging
up
[Verse
1:
Eminem]
Girl
you
gimme
writers
block
Im
at
a
loss
for
words
My
minds
as
lost
as
yours
I
rack
my
brain
but
still
no
thoughts
emerge
Never
seen
no
ass
as
large
as
yours
how
much
that
cost
Thats
what
I
call
a
Roethlisberger
You
drive
me
bonkers
Im
about
to
get
my
swerve
on
for
sure
Thought
I
was
pimpin
until
I
felt
like
Nas
the
first
date
Because
I
think
I
gave
you
power
when
I
gave
you
flowers
And
I
bought
us
a
box
of
chocolates
no
lozenges
or
cough
drops
or

Probably
should
of
never
let
me
call
that
job
of
yours
To
talk
to
your
boss
and
ask
him
if
you
can
take
off
from
work
Should
of
been
one
of
the
first
signs
to
cause
to
learn
Man
we
jumped
in
too
fast
cause
since
then
I
cant
be
apart
from
her
Cause
nobodies
bodys
awesomer
-
I
lust
it
and
she
loves
me
cause
Im
popular
but
[Hook:
Jamie
N
Commons]
You
know
this
aint
love
Oh
no
you
know
this
aint
love
You
know
this
aint
love
No
this
aint
love
What
is
it
then
Its
desperation
Shes
lookin
for
Mr
Right
wants
me
to
be
that
guy
to
her
Its
desperation
I
cant
even
put
up
a
fight
cause
I
give
in
at
the
sight
of
her
[Verse
2:
Eminem]
Well
obviously
oblivious
to
me
I
swore
I
was
just
invisible
to
you
til
I
went
to
the
lengths
I
did
to
meet
you
Cause
you
played
so
hard
to
get
with
me
from
the
beginning
Now
Im
in
disbelief
I
never
knew
that
this
could
be
such
misery
Cause
now
you
see
nothin
but
me
and
I
dont
see
nothin
but
you
And
Im
about
to
flip
cause
we
are
super
glued
in
We
stuck
to
each
others
hips
and
we
cant
do
anything
individually
Which
is
to
cling
on
scared
to
be
alone
cant
specifically
to
describe
it
I
just
cant
seem
to
give
a
reason
this
definitive
just
need
you
Talkin
bout
I
live
and
breathe
you
And
you
pretend
to
be
as
mentally
and
physically
addicted
to
me
As
Wiz
Khalifa
is
to
reefer
Dont
wanna
be
without
you
dont
wanna
be
with
you
neither
bitch
Put
me
in
a
situation
in
which
its
both
I
wish
to
seek
cause
this
aint
[Hook]
and
here
I
go
again
[verse
3:
Eminem]
Just
want
you
to
myself
dont
wanna
share
you
with
no
one
else
What
the
fuck
you
whispering
for
You
get
on
my
nerves
you
make
me
sick
I
think
our
relationship
it
seems
to
be
on
the
fritz
I
mean
its
time
that
we
just
split
and
leave
the
games
behind
Your
frame
of
mind
aint
the
same
as
mine
I
think
You
need
to
finish
developing
a
little
more
mentally
too
get
the
picture
Thats
a
negative
Alicia
I
will
never
give
the
Keys
up
To
the
crib
ever
again
no
reason
not
even
a
gift
certificate
from
Tiffanys
You
better
have
an
epiphany
slut
guess
what
what

Im
just
mad
it
took
the
time
it
took
me
to
discover
You
been
using
me
for
loot
like
I
used
you
for
looks
Thought
you
was
too
good
for
me
huh

used
to
be
my
Carrie
Underwood
I
was
your
lumberjack
but
I
cant
stomach
this
Im
leavin
you
not
comin
back
She
said
The
fuck
with
that
Wheres
my
Louisville
Slugger
at
She
grabbed
that
fuckin
bat
and
swung
it
at
my
head
I
barely
ducked
and
thats
right
when
she
came
up
with
a
kick
to
the
nuts
twice
Steel
toe
girl
probably
coulda
put
a
100
yard
field
goal
through
the
uprights
[Hook]
[Intro]
What
is
a
nightmare
The
dictionary
tells
us
it
is
a
terrifying
dream
a
nightmare
[Verse
1]
I
used
to
think
I
had
bad
luck
but
I
wasnt
superstitious
Till
one
day
I
grew
suspicious
when
I
stepped
on
a
crack
on
Aunt
Ednas
stoop
And
got
pooped
on
by
a
group
of
stupid
pigeons
Then
we
flew
the
coop
to
Michigan
to
start
a
new
be-ditching
Missouri
from
Michigan
didnt
work
So
we
moved
back
to
Missouri
from
Michigan
from
Missouri
back
to
Michigan
Someone
put
me
out
my
misery
I
cant
do
this
again
Mom
please
stick
to
a
decision
Discipline
last
thing
I
wanna
do
is
listen
shes
like
Lex
Luthor
bitch
her
rules
are
kryptonite
To
the
walls
and
Ive
lost
my
power
to
see
through
them
bitches
But
I
run
into
them
running
through
the
kitchen
Pretending
to
be
blind
Superman
Cos
I
had
no
supervision
But
I
did
have
a
super
power
though
I
could
turn
into
invisible
kid
Disappear
out
of
sight
like
a
true
magician
And
one
day
uncle
Ronnie
brought
over
this
new
but
different
Music
into
the
picture
and
it
become
my
new
religion
I
remember
it
clearly
even
today
Move
back
to
Michigan
again
to
live
with
my
Grandma
Ned
Always
itchin
for
something
to
do
was
flipping
Through
the
radio
stations
one
day
And
discovered
this
DJ
who
was
mixing
I
say
it
to
this
day
if
you
aint
listened
to
the
wizard
You
aint
have
a
fucking
clue
what
you
was
missing
Id
zone
out
with
my
headphones

For

You

new
LL
Cool
J
Think
I
finally
maneuvered
to
8
Mile
and
[Hoover]
and
somehow
I
found
my
future
is
in
this
Thats
how
I
know
my
mission
Little
boom
box
boomin
spitting
Practicing
numerous
rhythms
When
I
sit
in
my
room
envisioning
my
dreams
come
true
for
wishin
I
remember
Proof
would
visit
Couldnt
wait
to
play
him
my
new
shit
hed
go
complete
ballistic
Go
through
the
roof
for
his
shit
Its
like
we
knew
the
instant
We
touched
a
mic
that
both
of
us
two
existed
to
do
this
shit
Never
quit
too
persistent
Started
a
group
of
misfits
Proof
had
a
proposition
If
we
all
brand
together
there
aint
no
stopping
this
shit
Come
up
with
aliases
bipolar
opposites
and
Be
ready
to
come
off
the
top
as
sharp
position
If
you
got
dissed
at
the
shop
cause
if
they
caught
you
slippin
Theyd
take
your
spot
if
someone
got
to
rippin
you
And
you
forgot
your
written
Opportunity
knocked
us
once
it
aint
knocking
again
It
tried
dong
ditching
shit
I
fucking
got
that
bitch
in
a
headlock
Cut
off
his
oxygen
Slim
[]
Now
I
got
my
pot
to
piss
in
Im
in
a
league
Muhammads
in
All
these

Probably
end
up
on
top
of
them
Stomping
them
like
Ndamukong
Im
rushing
at
the
Flow
vomits
in
your
face
Competitors
fall
at
my
waist
You
spit
a
rhyme
I
spit
in
a
rhymes
face
So
name
the
time
place
to
battle
Bitch
Im
still
in
that
mind
state
Dont
make
me
step
on
you
and
make
you
wine
grapes
Cry
babies
maybe
my
way
that
I
use
words
is
loose
But
you
turds
better
be
careful
how
you
choose
yours
Cause
feelings
scar
but
egos
bruise
worse
And
the
truth
hurts
shit
no
wonder
youre
sore
losers
Ooh

more
trippin
in

songs
a
self

Words

The

wordsmith
So
let
these
words
lift
Cos
all
I
got
is
bars
for
you
dumbbells
and
doors

out
Each
verse

more
[]
than
the
first
And
you
aint
got
to
wear
no
shoes
and
shirt
in
this
beast
to
get
served
They
shall
not
escape
my
vengeance
And

unhumble
Don
You

Ill

out
like
a
fucking
yard
So
mow
the
fucking
lawn
your
asses
are
blades
of
grass
And
Im
fucking
up
this
whole
landscape
of
rap
The
GOAT
just
ate
eight
acres
and
ate
the
vet
Who
just
make
a
path
and
take
you
straight
to
your
favorite
rapper
Oh
look
my
notebook
with
smoke
cook
Like
the
flow
stood
a
foot
over
the
flame
on
the
stove
soot
Like
oak
wood
was
burning
Return
of
the
no
good
I
can
feel
the
heat
risin
Everything
is
on
fire
Today
is
a
painful
reminder
Of
why
we
can
only
get
brighter
The
further
you
put
it
behind
ya
But
right
now
Im
on
the
inside
Lookin
out
cause
Im
standin
in
the
flames
Its
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light
find
the
light
find
the
light
Im
standin
in
the
flames
Its
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light
find
the
light
find
the
light
Yesterday
was
the
tornado
warning
Todays
like
the
morning
after:
your
world
is
torn
in
half
You
wake
in
its
wake
to
start
the
mourning
process
And
rebuilding
youre
still
a
work
in
progress
Todays
a
whole
new
chapter
Its
like
an
enormous
asthma
Thunderstorm
has
passed
ya
You
weathered
it
and
poked
its
eye
out
With
the
thorn
bush
that
you
used
to
smell
the
roses
Stopped
to
inhale
cant
even
tell
your
nose
is
Stuffed
so
focused
on
the
bright
side
Then
you
floor
the
gas
pedal
And
hit
the
corner
fast
the
more
asserted
Never
looking
back
may
hit
the
curb
But
every
day
is
a
new
learning
curve
As
you
steer
through
life
Sometimes
you
might
not
wanna
swerve
but
you
have
to
To
avert
a
disaster
lucky
no
permanent
damage
Cause
they
hurt
you
so
bad
Its
like
they
murdered
your
ass
And
threw
dirt
on
your
casket
But
youve
returned
from
the
ashes
And
that
hurt
that
you
have
you
just
converted
to
gasoline
And
while
youre
burning
the
past
Standing
in
the
inferno
and
chant
Im
standin
in
the
flames
Its
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light
find
the
light
find
the
light
Im
standin
in
the
flames
Its
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light
find
the
light
find
the
light
Youre
so
familiarized
With
what
having
to
swallow
this
pill
is
like
It
happens
all
the
time
they
take
your
heart
and
steal
your
life
And
its
as
though
you
feel
youve
died
Cause
youve
been
killed
inside
But
yet
youre
still
alive
which
means
you
will
survive
Although
today
you
may
weep
cause
youre
weakened
And
everything
seems
so
bleak
and
Hopeless
the
light
that
youre
seekin
It
begins
to
seep
in
thats
the
only
thing
keepin
You
from
leapin
off
the
mothafreakin
deep
end
And
Im
pullin
for
you
to
push
through
this
feeling
And
with
a
little
time
that
should
do
the
healing
And
by
tomorrow
you
may
even
feel
so
good
That
youre
willing
to
forgive
em
Even
after
all
the
shit
you
been
put
through
this
feeling
Of
resilience
is
building
and
the
flames
are
burning
Quick
as
fire
would
through
this
building
Youre
sealed
in
but
youre
fireproof
Flame
retardant
you
withstood
it
And
as
you
climb
up
to
the
roof
youre
just
chillin
You
look
down
cause
youre
so
over
em
You
could
put
the
heel
of
your
foot
through
the
ceiling
As
time
passes
things
change
every
day
But
wounds
wounds
heal
But
scars
still
remain
the
same
But
tomorrow
todays
going
down
in
flames
Throw
the
match
set
the
past
ablaze
So
feel
the
fire
beneath
your
feet
As
you
barely
even
perspire
from
the
heat
Exhale
deep
and
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
And
as
you
say
goodbye
to
the
grief
Its
like
watching
the
walls
melt
in
your
prison
cell
But
youve
extinguished
this
livin
hell
Still
a
little
piece
of
you
dies
as
you
scream
Im
standin
in
the
flames
Its
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light
find
the
light
find
the
light
Im
standin
in
the
flames
Its
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light
find
the
light
find
the
light
I
feel
the
burn
watch
the
smoke
as
I
turn
Rising
a
phoenix
from
the
flames
I
have
learned
from
fighting
fights
that
werent
mine
Not
with
fists
but
with
wings
that
I
will
fly
And
Im
standin
in
the
flames
Its
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin

to
yesterday
Find

Im
getting
by
with
my
wicked
ways
Im
loading
up
and
Im
taking
names
I
want
to
dig
my
way
to
hell
I
want
to
dig
my
way
to
hell
[Verse
1]
Guess
I
got
a
way
with
words
I
could
get
away
with
murder
Ever
heard
of
Aspergers
Its
a
rare
condition
Its
what
youre
suffering
from
when
you
simply
dont
care
if
its
an
80
degree
day
and
theres
no
fricken
air
conditioning
And
you
cant
see
the
big
terrace
risen
Cus
you
got
the
windows
up
blaring
the
system
in
your
chevrolet
prism
The
devil
aint
on
the
level
same
as
him
Just
someone
who
rebels
in
straight
masochism
And
imagine
him
giving
him
an
adjective
an
ass
whooping
so
bad
they
should
put
his
ass
in
prison
I
word
bully
I
verbally
abuse
verbs
like
he
did
something
to
me
personally
Used
forgetfully
so
I
cut
class
and
ditch
it
now
I
fully
rap
Caddilac
from
a
K
Car
My
ass
from
a
hole
in
a
ground
still
cant
tell
a
[]
Came
straight
out
the
trailer
park
screaming
Im
proud
To
shop
at
k-mart
and
it
became
art
And
Im
still
fed
up
and
as
pissed
off
as
they
are
To
this
day
I
still
get
in
fights
with
the
same
broad
At
the
same
Walmart
arguing
over
the
same
cart
In
the
middle
of
the
aisle
whilin
I
dont
give
a
fuck
I
dont
play
You
think
you
saw
this
basket
first
Yeah
backwards
like
motherfucking
Bob
and
Silent
Jay
Illest
shit
you
could
think
I
would
say
Minds
like
a
pile
of
clay
Whens
the
last
time
you
saw
a
villain
with
a
cape
Put
a
gaping
hole
in
it
[]
Tied
him
around
my
neck
went
down
the
fire
escape
of
the
Empire
State
Straight
fell
straight
down
to
the
ground
splattered
all
over
the
entire
state
And
straight
to
hell
got
an
impaled
by
the
gates
So
Satan
stuck
his
face
in
an
ashtray
But
I
sacheted
around
flames
with
a
match
and
I
gave
him
the
gas
face
[]
And
this
got
nothing
to
do
with
a
scalar
[]
By
the
way
thoughts
are
getting
darker
by
the
day
Im
a
combination
of
Skylar
Grey
Tyler
the
Creator
and
Violent
Jay
Its
a
fucking
miracle
to
be
this
lyrical
Paint
my
face
with
clown
make
up
and
a
smiley
face
Im
insane
Every
rhyme
I
say
[]
like
an
ultra
violet
ray
Im
sellin
hatred
buffet
style
all
the
shit
you
can
eat
$1199
so
come
on
and
pile
a
plate
Im
throwin
down
the
gauntlet
to
see
what
hell
I
can
raise
With
the

Im
spittin
while
Im
shittin
on
the
competition
In
the
meantime
its

Ive
been
a
career
asshole
I
dont
see
why
these
people
always
got
my
back
I
done
said
so
much
fucked
up
shit
I
was
born
a
mistake
But
I
was
put
here
not
by
accident
I
had
a
purpose
and
that
purpose
was
to
beat
a
beat
purplish
Slaughter
tracks
I
done
put
my
two
dimes
and
a
nickel
in
this
shit
And
Im
coming
to
get
that
quarter
back
[]
the
drama
can
build
Your
mama
can
ask
me
for
my
autograph
That
cougars
a
MILF
shes
the
oldest
trick
in
the
book
But
I
sure
would
fall
for
that
You
done
brought
a
bat
to
a
rocket
launcher
fight
When
I
get
on
the
mic
Im
a
snap
Make
you
wish
the
ambulance
that
took
me
to
the
hospital
when
I
overdosed
would
have
caught
a
flat
If
it
makes
you
sick
to
your
stomach
pass
it
Indigestion
my
suggestions
[]
If
it
feels
like
Im
running
away
with
the
game
Its
cus
I
am
dont
speculate
spectate
All
I
got
is

days
and
insults
for
decades
But
I
get
by
my
wicked
ways
lady
you
can
suck
a
dick
till
your
neck
aches
Cry
till
you
get
puffed
eyes
red
face
But
Im
leaving
on
this
jet
plane

Im
sick
of
pounding
a
squarepagan
around
all

of
the
catchrays
But
your
baggage
aint
gonna
fit
in
my
storage
over
headspace
Cuz
you
just
aint
big
enough
to
fit
your
damage

Other
words
dont
try
to
put
the
heart
in
a
headcase
Cuz
baby
stable
mentally
I
aint
I
need
my
meds
I
peed
my
bed
Im
going
blind
I
dont
see
my
legs
I
keep
on
falling
down
No
wonder
you
cant
stand
me
I
need
my
cane
Someone
help
me
I
think
my
face
is
melting
You
my
grains
these
maggot
in
my
brain
This
G-I-A-N-T
hole
in
my
empty
head
If
you
read
my
mind
you
can
see
my
pain
And
youd
see
why
Id
be
this
way
Ever
since
I
was
playin
with

Or
shut
the
P-I-E
hoes
that
peep
my
game
Used
to
get
bent
now
I
represent
to
the
fullest
Pencil
is
full
of
insolent
bullets
Im
like
a
Doberman
Pinscher
Pitbull
and
a
Rott
Mixed
with
a
toxic
the
plot
begins
to
thicken
I
begin
to
spittin
like
vintage
Pac
Demented
demonic
sinister
Ever
since
the
the
Doc
replenished
me
The
day
he
gave
me
that
shot
when
I
was
just
bout
to
quit
So
to
not
see
him
with
me
would
be
a
shocking
image
And
Im
the
definition
of
what
a
concrete
chin
is
Cause
no
matter
how
many
times
you
sock
me
in
it
And
knock
me
to
the
canvas
Even
the
boxing
critics
know
that
if
I
get
off
to
a
rocky
start
Ill
always
have
a
Rocky
finish
Eat
me
brocoli
spinach
cocky
Nope
But
I
hope
I
offended
you
when
I
told
ya
how
dope
I
am
at
this
and
put
emphasis
on
the
dope
So
when
names
come
up
in
that
conversation
of
whos
the
dopest
better
throw
mine
in
it
And
dont
mind
me
while
I
remind
you
of
the
flow
You
wont
find
anywhere
when
it
fires
and
I
unload
My
pen
explodes
til
theres
no
rhymes
in
it
Reload
in
no
time
let
insults
fly
every
60
seconds
that
go
by
So
you
know
I
meant
it
In
school
I
was
so
shy
timid
Two
pairs
of
jeans
Id
alternate
bummy
clothes
I
member
Begging
my
mom
for
K-Mart
McGregors
Cause
they
were
new
St
Vincent
de
Paul
Those
Ponys
were
used
and
no
size
fitted
But
kissed
them
old
days
adiós
I
did
it
They
said
I
was
a
gimmick
Now
Im
the
one
that
those
guys
mimic
Now
you
fuckers
dont
wanna
go
starting
no
argument
Cause
you
know
Ill
win
it
Name
a
flow
thats
more
authentic
and
dont
front
You
know
I
got
you
open

Big
Proof
You

me
Molded
my
flow

spirits
flowing
through
me
I
love

Doody
without
you
I
feel
so
incomplete
Im
no
king
no
need
for
rose
petals
to
be
thrown
at
my
feet
Im
a
thorn
in
your
side
get
thrown
into
a
throne
Better
watch
the
fucking
tone
that
you
speak
Feel
like
Im

Im

a
whole
different
league
On
my

No

And
Ive

From

or

Im

Its

to
decipher
what
cypher
I
might
jump
into
tonight
Cause
Im
hyper
or
something
Needing
someone
or
something

lighting
This
fire
under
me
its
breathing
new
life
Its
like
I
already
died
once
I
guess
some
people
only
live
twice
and
its
funny
My
days
of
being
broke
were
so
long
ago
I

of
money
But

But

Whos

shop
to
The
Wired
Frog
Night
club

I
was
taught
if
you
see
these
on
fire
You
had
to
put
it
out
yourself
like
Highland
Park
no
fire
department
So
you
may
not
hear
sirens
at
all
But
dont
be
alarmed
if
I
sound
off
Something

aint
right
with
me

A

be
harder
Widely
regarded
highly
bite

Im
slightly
retarded
But

Im
starting

Im
feeling
self
righteous
I
might
just
hop
in
a
mosh
pit
on
some
Mike
Tyson
and
Pac

Looking
to
box
with
anybody
disorderly
conduct
Ill

Fan

Panic

Cause

Toxic

Black

But

Im
conscious
What

doc
I
passed
out
again
Alcohols
making
me
break
into
vacants
naked
Stole
a
Magnum
box
and
bag
Cirocs
in
back
of
a
Doxon
Fell
asleep
watching
Fear
Factor
and
Scare
Tactics
Too
close
to
the
stair
master
Poked
a
hole
in
the
air
mattress
and
popped
it
Woke
up
shortly
there
after
hungover
No
one
to
wear
grasping
a
bear
rasped
it
and
dropped
it
Air
Max
in
my
closet
preposterous
Nikes
made
out
of
ostrich
And
the
cross
stitching
is
a
cross
mix
Of
a
rhinoceros
possum
skin
giraffe
and
a
dolphin
Dolphin
fin
dockers
eyes
cautious
drop
crotches
Swats
watches
and
sneakers
matches
with
the
parkers
But
its
like
being
overstepped
at
a
boxing
gym
With
all
these
trainers
but
I
dont
have
any
boxers
And
Im
standing
here
naked
hangover
still
wasted
Like
paper
you
write
raps
on
obnoxious
Yo
why
does
it
always
sound
like
Im
grabbing
my
nostrils
Fuck
that
Ill
battle

Ill
battle
em
all
Ill
stand
there
and
yell
mad
at
a
wall
Until
the
mannequin
doll
scatter
the
inanimate
objects
That
Im
badder
than
all
shatter
and
fall
Cause
I
hear
the
track
And
Im
starting
to
get
fucking
amped
Imma
spark
with
em
Like
the
car
with
the
cables
hooked
to
my
fucking
back
Im
a
Duracell
But
I
sure
as
hell
got
it
backwards
cause
yall
could
get
jumped
And
Id
catch
the
battery
charge
but
I
got
a
hunch
like
your
back
when
its
arching
When
I
start
attacking
your
squadron
Youll
feel
like
Master
Card
when
Im
charging
So

a
swipe
at
me
Im

Like
Clay
Matthews

Green
Bay
Packers
So

No

sick
prick

hard
I

a
Magic
Johnson
Its
like
a
magic
wand
allows
me
to
not
let
a
blonde
arouse
me
If
Ronda
Rousey
was
on
the
couch
with
the
condoms
out
Holding
a
thousand
Magnums
at
once
Wants
to
Pounce
How
I
laugh
in
response
how
she
dances
and
flaunts
it
around
me
Her
flat
little
badonkadonk
is
bouncing
around
And
all
I

Paulie
Malign

a
blouse
And
Madonna

Just

Complete
lack
of

Half
you
assholes

to
pick
up
a
spirit
Shit

a
thrift
shop
But

energy
Klepto

Always

bullshit
Perhaps
Ill
launch
some
cracker
taunts
at
Action
Bronson
Macklemore
and
Mac
Miller
and
Asher
Roth
Have
some
back

forths
And

Control
verse
And

Fack
in
concert
Hey

Yo
I
put
that
shit
on
a
Greatest
Hits
album
Now
that
was
awesome
It
takes
some
massive
balls
to
do
some
shit
like
that
Sometimes
I
have
to
ponder
why
people
are
like
Ill
stick
around
And
put
up
with
my
crap
so
long
for
Whats
the
attraction
mama
Is
it
the
fact
that
Im
a
walking
talking
actual
quadruple

you
mama
Who

this
point
its
always
poking
so
meh
Still

along
with
this
voice
cause
thats
the
monster
So
do-si-do

a
sociopath

What
they
dont
know
is
the
fact
Rihanna

me
Pinocchio

She
loves
the
way
I
lie
Sits
on
my
face
and
waits
for
my
nose
to

Pathological

I
guess
you
could
consider
it
poetry
but
with
me
it
started
out
with
just
words
just
words
They
started
looking
like
puzzle
pieces
so
I
started
connecting
them
to
each
other
til
they
started
to
resemble
blank
canvases
By
this
time
I
was
an
artist
so
I
just
started
to
see
these
pictures

real
visuals

To

Sayin

Did
you
ever
think
we
would
come
to
find
Maybe
in
my
dreams
The
thought
of
retiring
Is
makin
me
want
to
set
your
daughter
on
fire
with
a
soldering
iron
What
up
mom
applyin
for
the
rim
job
are
you
hirin
Im
hopin
to
fill
up
your
opening
Oh
but
I
know
I
gotta
meet
a
lot
of
requirements
First
I
gotta
accept
you
in
the
lobby
and
the
isle
and
Youve
probably
already
been
with
all
the
slaughter
and
iron
men
No
mood
to
be
playin
second
fiddle
slob
on
this
violin
With
no
strings
attached
Im
just
the
product
of
a
hostile
environment
But
bein
brought
up
so
brought
up
inspired
But
I
dont
know
why
its
still
like
Im
caught
up
inside
a
whirlpool
Not
an
appliance
but
applyin
this
science
I
psychotically
rhyme
And
its
like
stars
have
aligned
all
in
alliance
Heart
of
a
lion
balls
of
Goliath
Obscene
talkin
the
twine
like
a
beans
talkin
and
buyin
But
I
keep
walkin
the
line
between
the
wrong
and
the
right
But
everything
I
write
seems
wrong
and
its
like
Im
ecstatic
at
all
the
static
that
I
can
still
cause
In
the
fabric
of
our
modern
society
Now
Catholics
are
panicking
cause
I
snapped
back
to
my
old
antics
and
shenanigans
Dammit
the
popes
mad
again
Probably
shouldnt
have
ran
up
in
the
Vatican
with
that
mannequin
Singin
Bagpipes
from
Baghdad
again
In
my
dads
drag
draggin
a
faggot
in
a
glad
bag
Wont
be
the
last
time
I
make
a
dramatic
entrance
like
that
again
You
thought
I
was
lyin
when
I
said
I
think
that
Im
crossin
the
line
again
Ive
lost
my
mind
caution
oh
God
I
think
Ive
thought
of
another
fucking
line
Forgive
me
father
for
I
have
sinned
But
hip
hop
has
left
me
brainwashed
with
a
violent
streak
Defiant
now
the
odds
of
me
tryin
to
fuckin
be
quiet
Probably
gotta
be
bout
as
high
as
the
Jolly
Green
Giant
After
hes
fallen
in
pollen
next
to
a
killer
bee
hive
colony
tryin
to
sneak
by
it
So
please
dont
follow
me
while
I
revive
rap
Ima
start
up
a
rioting
try
to
stop
it
or
silence
it
Youre
not
gonna
might

hit
the
block
in
your
joggin
attire
in
Boston
across

Put

thoughts
against
mine
Cause

arsenal
I
havell
scar
you

life
worse
than
Dzhokhar
And
I
have
a
bomb
pliers
and
barbed
wire
Your
bars
are
like
Barney
Fife
with
a
fucking
swiss
army
knife
A
saber
thats
Darth
Vader
with
arthritis
at
a
bar
fight
With
the
Dark
Knight
on
a
dark
night
with
his
arms
tied
up
Im
Dahmer-like
when
Im
on
the
mic
Im
not
gonna
lie
Perform
like
Im
gonna
die
at
the
end
of
a
song
so
its
hard
for
the
rhyme
to
end
Like
fuck

Like
Im
locked
up
inside
a
shot
of
Bonnie
and
Clyde

Uncle
Ronnie

Fuck

You

A
psychopath
Im

Goin

A

apologizing
to
you
I
didnt
do

deserve
what
youre
puttin
me
through
This

So

Why

Im
reminded
of
you
Saw
two
white
coffins
in
my
dreams
last
night
I
saw
my
Lord
Jesus
with
his
hands
pointing
toward
the
light
Saw
my
old
sweetheart
she
said
honey
Im
back
Just
so
you
dont
die
alone
just
so
you
dont
die
alone
Guess
I
gotta
deal
with
the
fact
that
you
aint
never
comin
back
Now
every
woman
that
I
look
at
Im
lookin
for
you
So
Im
findin
something
the
matter
with
them
Excuse
to
not
see
anyone
Useless
rather
pick
up
the
phone
not
at
all
followin
protocol
I
get
bowled
like
bowling
balls
No
calls
and
know
to
call
to
talk
forget
what
I
want
to
say
Damnit
Im
drawin
blanks
like
Im
playin
hangman
Im
sick
of
playin
these
games
I
cant
handle
this
heartbreak
Its
makin
me
wanna
blow
out
my
brains
Like
birthday
cake
candles
Hang
up
the
phone
and
I
shake
I
think
I
may
have
made
a
mistake
Cant
escape
the
madness
Turn
the
radio
on
I
hate
this
sad
song
But
I
cant
even
change
the
station
The
same
ones
playin
on
eight
channels
I
lay
awake
in
shambles
Im
startin
to
hallucinate
And
Im
havin
all
these
visions
of
us
at
each
others
wakes
In
caskets
and
suddenly
I
wake
and
thats
when
I
know
I
Saw
two
white
coffins
in
my
dreams
last
night
I
saw
my
Lord
Jesus
with
his
hands
pointing
toward
the
light
Saw
my
old
sweetheart
she
said
honey
Im
back
Just
so
you
dont
die
alone
just
so
you
dont
die
alone
Give
me
one
more
bottle
for
the
pain
Give
me
one
more
for
the
memories
Give
me
one
more
Ill
make
it
taste
like
a
steak
Itll
help
alleviate
Itll
soothe
this
ache
Of
trying
to
fake
That
shes
really
shes
really
coming
back
And
its
been
a
while
now
but
I
finally
realize
how
Much
reality
sucks
but
its
just
something
about
our
love
Im
still
with
in
denial
now
dealing
with
the
finality
of
it
And
its
making
me
crazy
thinking
of
the
days
we
spent
And
how
Ill
never
hold
you
again
And
there
aint
shit
I
can
do
about
it
Now
my
head
is
overcrowded
With
these
tired
memories
and
I
cant
seem
to
get
you
out
it
And
how
the
fuck
do
you
sleep
comfortably
Knowing
what
you
done
did
to
me
huh
Did
it
even
occur
to
you
that
I
loved
you
huh
Complete
madly
head
over
heels
for
you
Was
you
and
me
wants
us
to
be
together
forever
It
was
supposed
to
be
us
but
you
crushed
the
dream
We
was
supposed
to
die
together
and
its
killing
me
so
much
When
I
sleep
I
wake
up
dead
must
be
why
I
Saw
two
white
coffins
in
my
dreams
last
night
I
saw
my
Lord
Jesus
with
his
hands
pointing
toward
the
light
Saw
my
old
sweetheart
she
said
honey
Im
back
Just
so
you
dont
die
alone
just
so
you
dont
die
alone
Got
a
shitty
grin
bitch

me
them
itty-bitty
titties

Were
in
Sin
City
since

addicted
to

Diggity

You

busy
bitch
stick-stickity

Got
a
6
o
clock
craving

Ciroc
Its
about
to
be
an
unbelievable
night
I
call
it
surreal
Sir
Mix
a
Lot
tape
in
Hit
the
spot
spot
my
next
victim
Im
picky
like
I
missed
a
spot
shaving
Came
to
sip
vodka
shit
yeah
that
little
chick
is
hot
but
if
she
got
rabies
I
wouldnt
give
the
bitch
a
shot
I
poke
her
in
the
rear
But
I
bet
if
I
lick
her
shell
try
to
chase
me
Haha
What
are
you
pit
rott
mixed
or
you
just
got
fixed
well
shit
then
lets
lip-lock
If
not
then
trick
piss
off
you
snobby
little
pig
snot
nose
You
think
youre
hot
shit
cause
youre
in
heat
Well
bitch
if
youre
solar
Then
Im
your
polar
opposite
dog
cause
Im
colder
than
popsicle
sticks
poppin
shit
Talkin
it
walkin
it
spit
rocks
Then
my
sick
thoughts
are
about
to
lick
shots
Like
this
shits
hopping
and
drip-dropping
in
chocolate-ly
whip-topping
So
whether
youre
Hip
Hop
Slipknot
Big
Pac
Kid
Rock
Kris
Kross
Rick
Ross
youll
dig
this
If
not
then
kick
rocks
in
flip
flops
And
I
produced
the
track
So
you
dont
have
to
ask
who
it
is
when
this
shit
knocks
TURN
UP
So
bring
clairvoyance
to
this
bangin
and
Imma
keep
on
saying
All
the
shit
I
should
be
hung
for
and
probably
killed
for
saying
And
I
probably
will
but
not
until
the
day
I
pop
a
pill
again
Like
chopping
til
Im
dropping
still
if
that
dont
do
the
job
of
killing
Shady
then
the
karma
will
insane
him
Im
as
brainy
Mohammad
until
the
Parkinsons
done
eat
away
my
brain
And
made
me
Robin
Williams
crazy
Or
I
end
up
with
dementia
but
you
rocking
with
a
sadist
Hate
to
say
this
but
if
the
thought
is
entertaining
I
aint
stopping
till
be
sprayed
it
Oh
my
god
for
real
man
not
again
Im
shaking
But
before
I
tie
a
rope
around
this
nob
If
they
dont
like
it
got
a
knob
they
can
slob
on
until
-
Wait
I
just
forgot
what
I
was
thinking
Whats
it
called
again
Im
blanking
Something
about
the
balls
between
my
legs
and
I
think
I
can
feel
it
dangling
its
throbbing
and
its
veiny
Wait
I
think
I
got
it
okay
bitch
I
got
you
Robin
Williams
hanging
Go
hang
in
the
lobby
unless
you
came
to
slob
me
Come
on
kemosabe
Its
past
time
like
your
favorite
hobby
Cause
if
the
way
that
I
spit
shit
remains
on
my
dick
then
she
grab
me
by
the
nuts
and
tried
to
take
my
sausage
as
a
hostage
Aint

Pretty
much
a
no

Cobainer

plain
addicted
to
my
dick
like
Lorena
Bobbit
Got

wean

took
my
fucking
penis

it
and
stuck
it
up
between
her
armpits
And
she
begun
to
swing
a
crumpet
knife
and
paint
the
carpet
at
least
thats
what
her
train
of
thought
is
Cause
I
came
saw
conquered

it
and
made
up
a
plane
of
bonkers
And
I

Til

Whatever

Treat

women

my
stable
like

Looking

7
days
In

and

We

She

Jay
Electronic
Im

And

is
a
gun
left
with
a
bayonet
on
it
Next
ho
froze
and
it
look
like
I
walked
in
to
a
jewelry
store
With
a
about
a
million
dollars
with
your
mama
And
sat
down
did
an
ALS
challenge
haaaan
I
stole
that
adlib
from
French
Bad
&
Evil
back
at
it
again
About
to
get
my
back
tatted
again
About
to
get
a
pic
of
a
backstabber
with
an
axe
in
his
hand
Sitting
on
a
bike
in
the
sand
If
you
aint
been
through
nothing
Then
that
shouldnt
mean
nothing
to
you
like
legs
on
a
crab
If
she
current
I
keep
her
pussy
purring
like
the
pipes
on
a
lamp
Weed
got
her
so
chinky
eyed
Look
like
she
been
getting
high
on
a
flight
to
Japan
I
keep
my
jewelry
on
while
Im
fucking
Sound
like
Im
shaking
up
dice
in
a
can
Listen
though
this
aint
Christmas
I
make
you
my
ex
miss
If
this
is
my
passion
I
learn
to
give
those
who
dont
appreciate
my
presence
The
gift
of
my
absence
I
dont
know
who
you
been
listening
to
Got
me
fucked
up
like
Pookie
in
the
chicken
coop
Bitch
I
dont
give

Bitch

the
fuck
out
of
my
face
To
make
a
long
story
short
I
dont
really
gotta
stand
there
And
listen
to
you
while
you
throw
a
silly
tantrum
Even
though
I
have
an
affinity
for
witty
banter
Starting
to
feel
like
foulplay
like
Billy
Laimbeer
Hold

she
misunderstood

I
said
saint
por

Thought
I
said

Give

the
club
with
my
tab
still
open
Wont

Decapitated

Heavy

Still

times
Sittin

In

Yall

ready
know
Slaughterhouse
Feels
like
a
close
its
coming
to
Fuck
am
I
gonna
do
Its
too
late
to
start
over
This
is
the
only
thing
I
thing
I
know
Sometimes
I
feel
like
all
I
ever
do
is
Find
different
ways
to
word
the
same
old
song
Ever
since
I
came
along
From
the
day
the
song
called
Hi
My
Name
Is
dropped
Started
thinking
my
name
was
fall
Cause
anytime
things
went
wrong
I
was
the
one
who
they
would
blame
it
on
The
media
made
me
the
equivalent
of
a
modern-day
Genghis
Kahn
Tried
to
argue
it
was
only
entertainment
dawg
Gangsta
Naw
courageous
balls
Had
to
change
my
style
they
said
Im
way
too
soft
And
I
sound
like
AZ
and
Nas
out
came
the
claws
And
the
things
been
out
since
then
But
up
until
the
instant
that
Ive
been
against
it
It
was
ingrained
in
me
that
I
wouldnt
amount
to
a
shitstain
I
thought
No
wonder
I
had
to
unlearn
everything
that
my
brain
was
taught
Do
I
really
belong
in
this
game
I
pondered
I
just
wanna
play
my
part
should
I
make
waves
or
not
So
back
and
forth
in
my
brain
the
tug
of
war
wages
on
And
I
dont
wanna
seem
ungrateful
or
disrespect
the
artform
I
was
raised
upon
But
sometimes
you
gotta
take
a
loss
And
have
people
rub
it
in
your
face
before
you
get
made
pissed
off
And
keep
pluggin
its
your
only
outlet
And
your
only
outfit
so
you
know
they
gonna
talk
about
it
Better
find
a
way
to
counter
it
quick
and
make
it
ah
Feel
like
Ive
already
said
this
a
kabillion
eighty
times
How
many
times
can
I
say
the
same
thing
different
ways
that
rhyme
What
I
really
wanna
say
is
is
there
anyone
else
who
can
relate
to
my
story
Bet
you
feel
the
same
way
I
felt
when
I
was
in
the
same
place
you
are
when
I
was
afraid
to
Afraid
to
make
a
single
sound
Afraid
I
will
never
find
a
way
out
out
out
Afraid
I
never
before
I
didnt
wanna
go
another
round
An
angry
mans
power
will
shut
you
up
Trip
wires
fill
this
house
with
tip-toe
love
Run
out
of
excuses
with
every
word
So
here
I
am
and
I
will
not
run
Guts
over
fear
The
time
is
here
Guts
over
fear
I
shall
not
tear
For
all
the
times
I
let
you
push
me
around
and
let
you
keep
me
down
Now
I
got
Guts
over
fear
guts
over
fear
Feels
like
a
close
its
coming
to
Fuck
am
I
gonna
do
Its
too
late
to
start
over
This
is
the
only
thing
I
thing
I
know
Its
like
I
was
there
once
single
parents
Hate
your
appearance
did
you
struggle
to
find
your
place
in
this
world
And
the
pain
spawns
all
the
anger
on
But
it
wasnt
until
I
put
the
pain
in
songs
learned
who
to
aim
it
on
That
I
made
a
spark
started
to
spit
hard
as
shit
Learned
how
to
harness
it
while
the
reins
were
off
And
there
was
a
lot
of
bizarre
shit
but
the
crazy
part
Was
soon
as
I
stopped
saying
I
gave
a
fuck
Haters
started
to
appreciate
my
art
And
it
just
breaks
my
heart
to
look
at
all
the
pain
Ive
caused
But
what
am
I
gonna
do
when
the
rage
is
gone
The
lights
go
out
in
the
trailer
park
And
the
window
that
was
closing
and
theres
nowhere
else
I
can
go
with
flows
in
And
Im
frozen
cause
theres
no
more
emotion
for
me
to
pull
from
Just
a
bunch
of
playful
songs
that
I
made
for
fun
So
to
the
break
of
dawn
here
I
go
recycling
the
same
old
song
But
Id
rather
make
Not
Afraid
2
than
another
make
mothafuckin
We
Made
You
uh
Now
I
dont
wanna
seem
indulgent
when
I
discuss
my
lows
and
my
highs
My
demise
and
my
uprise
pray
to
God
I
just
opened
enough
eyes
later
on
Gave
you
the
supplies
and
the
tools
to
hopefully
use
it
to
make
you
strong
And
enough
to
lift
yourself
up
when
you
feel
like
I
felt
Cause
I
cant
explain
to
yall
how
dang
exhausted
my
legs
felt
Just
having
to
balance
my
damn
self
Those
dang
eggshells
I
was
made
to
walk
But
thank
you
ma
cause
that
gave
me
the
Strength
to
cause
Shady-mania
so
many
empty
that
stadium
At
least
I
made
it
out
of
that
house
and
a
found
a
place
in
this
world
when
the
day
was
done
So
this
is
for
every
kid
who
alls
they
ever
did
was
dreamt
that
one
day
they
would
just
get
accepted
I
represent
him
or
her
or
anyone
similar
you
are
the
reason
that
I
made
this
song
Everything
youre
scared
to
say
dont
be
afraid
to
say
no
more
From
this
day
on
forward
just
let
them
a-holes
talk
Take
it
with
a
grain
of
salt
and
eat
their
fucking
faces
off
The
legend
of
the
angry
blonde
lives
on
through
you
when
Im
gone
And
to
think
I
was
Afraid
to
make
a
single
sound
Afraid
I
will
never
find
a
way
out
out
out
Afraid
I
never
before
I
didnt
wanna
go
another
round
An
angry
mans
power
will
shut
you
up
Trip
wires
fill
this
house
with
tip-toe
love
Run
out
of
excuses
with
every
word
So
here
I
am
and
I
will
not
run
Guts
over
fear
The
time
is
here
Guts
over
fear
I
shall
not
tear
For
all
the
times
I
let
you
push
me
around
and
let
you
keep
me
down
Now
I
got
Guts
over
fear

fear

Another
day
another
hotel
the
inside
of
its
nice
though
Oh
well
this
is
my
life
so
As
I
go
and
try
to
close
for
the
nights
show
See
how
far
that
line
goes
Still
blows
my
mind
show
Business
Ill
never
get
some
of
this
shit
just
always
gives
a
weird
To
this
day
cause
all
I
ever
did
Was
just
say
the
shit
Im
the
one
that
wanted
to
hear
Other
people
say
to
me
when
I
was
a
kid
Son
please
dont
make
me
some
type
of
hero
Cause
I
will
say
some
inspirational
shit
in
a
real
way
But
will
still
have
a
field
day
with
some
of
the
Fucked
up
shit
in
the
world
and
tell
it
to
suck
the
dick
Cause
I
still
make
fun
of
a
situation
Someones
in
like
a
son
of
a
bitch
At
anothers
expense
Im
fuckin
relentless
As
fuck
when
it
comes
to
this
pen
I
struggle
with
coming
to
my
senses
Stuck
on
the
fence
on
a
balance
beam
if
I
seem
unbalanced
Its
challenging
but
my
conscience
allows
me
to
think
The
most
foulish
childish
things
without
even
blinking
Without
even
thinkin
about
all
the
stinkin
amounts
of
people
that
seem
to
be
reachin
in
the
crowds
Im
scream
in
the
palace
sold
out
this
evening
But
now
its
maybe
down
to
sleeping
Is
it
really
my
soul
to
keep
or
Have
I
sold
it
cheap
is
it
greed
Do
I
take
more
than
I
need
When
I
joke
about
leavin
But
keep
over
achievin
Because
whats
stolen
from
me
barely
broke
even
Its
a
fine
fine
line
Its
a
fine
fine
line
So
I
notice
how
I
paint
myself
And
through
my
hair
when
ordeals
Im
so
vain
I
want
my
respect
but
ignore
the
Butterfly
effect
that
comes
from
my
dialect
Till
I
sit
in
the
dark
and
I
reflect
And
my
reflection
shows
what
its
like
here
Cause
this
vanity
surrounded
by
all
these
lights
yeah
Its
like
a
nightmare
I
said
this
vanity
surrounded
by
these
lights
is
a
nightmare
And
I
dont
like
how
I
see
myself
so
I
Open
the
Bible
to
Isaiah
cause
I
swear
to
Christ
there
are
nights
where
I
stay
up
at
night
just
to
say
a
prayer
twice
Just
to
make
sure
God
hears
cause
this
ice
layer
Ice
skate
on
tonights
where
Put
in
it
but
I
like
stands
Feistier
then
a
triceritops
and
like
a
dice
player
I
got
a
nice
pair
of
dice
here
Sealed
off
in
my
lair
Away
from
the
bullshit
good
safe
place
to
sit
and
talk
shit
From
this
house
its
quite
big
but
it
aint
when
you
cant
leave
it
And
I
feel
so
isolated
nice
I
made
it
But
its
like
I
payed
the
price
of
fame
twice
I
hate
it
So
I
bitch
about
my
life
then
make
another
song
its
a
cycle
aint
it
Then
I
wonder
why
Im
still
famous
Keep
walkin
the
line
This
gold
fish
poke
its
old
But
especially
when
you
dont
know
If
your
conscience
is
sayin
I
told
you
so
You
dont
even
know
anymore
if
you
got
the
soul
of
a
soldier
Or
if
you
sold
your
soul
Its
a
fine
fine
line
Its
a
fine
fine
line
And
from
here
you
look
so
small
Hovering
high
above
us
all
Please
come
back
to
me
I
still
remember
the
times
when
They
were
simpler
than
the
rhymes
of
Vanilla
Ice
were
when
I
was
just
killin
the
mics
Ill
never
forget
what
that
feeling
was
like
God
I
miss
those
times
now
when
I
was
just
starting
out
Without
a
diamond
now
Im
diamond
I
cant
even
stage
dive
in
the
crowd
anymore
now
when
Ive
been
Stuck
in
this
house
hibernate
Hate
even
going
outside
it
Sucks
sometimes
I
just
wanna
walk
in
Target
and
look
at
shit
Browse
I
dont
even
want
to
buy
nothin
I
just
wanna
fuckin
walk
around
inside
it
Look
how
excited
I
sound
when
I
get
to
talkin
bout
life
and
Everything
about
it
I
miss
Which
now
reminds
me
Put
a
thousand
lighters
in
the
sky
for
the
Outsidaz
Wow
I
must
have
had
Alzheimers
Long
time
since
I
shouted
them
out
bout
time
Cause
its
been
on
my
mind
lately
how
Zee
you
always
supported
me
You
vouched
I
will
never
forget
that
and
How
you
guys
accepted
me
for
me
and
Pace
I
love
you
too
you
slept
on
my
couch
And
I
been
thinkin
bout
the
time
I
slept
on
the
floor
at
the
outhouse
Rhyming
is
all
we
ever
wanted
to
do
And
regardless
how
life
has
turned
out
Inside
Ill
always
be
an
outsider
My
life
has
been
turned
inside
out
but
I
Its
a
fine
fine
line
Its
a
fine
fine
line
Hes
had
that
stone
face
as
if
Im
not
here
Cant
you
see
that
Ive
been
crying
I
didnt
know
youd
be
insane
Dreams
can
be
so
deceiving
Youre
an
itch
I
cant
reach
A
wound
that
wont
heal
The
smell
of
skin
thats
burning
I
didnt
know
youd
be
insane
But
its
true
and
just
say
all
I
am
to
you
Is
a
pain
in
my
neck
thorn
in
my
side
Stain
on
my
blade
blood
on
my
knife
Been
dreaming
of
her
all
of
my
life
But
she
wont
come
true
shes
just
my
nightmare
I
woke
up
to
Shes
twisted
hes
a
rebel
shes
set
hes
hard
to
handle
The
worst
part
of
all
is
he
just
dont
care
Shes
twisted
like
a
rope
that
is
wrapped
around
his
throat
But
the
worst
part
of
all
is
she
really
dont
give
a
She
dont
give
a
shit
Sometimes
I
wish
that
youd
just
die
Cause
Im
too
afraid
of
leaving
I
didnt
know
youd
be
insane
Dreams
can
be
so
deceiving
How
did
it
come
to
this
Why
do
I
fantasize
to
kill
you
when
youre
sleeping
I
didnt
know
you
feel
the
same
When
I
say
youre
no
good
All
you
are
to
me
Is
a
pain
in
my
neck
thorn
in
my
side
Stain
on
my
blade
blood
on
my
knife
Been
dreaming
of
her
all
of
my
life
But
she
wont
come
true
shes
just
my
nightmare
I
woke
up
to
Shes

hes
a

shes

hes
hard
to

The
worst
part
of
all
is
he
just
dont

Shes
twisted
like
a
rope
that
is
wrapped

his
throat
But
the
worst
part
of
all
is
she
really

She
dont
give

Love
aint
no
fairytale
love
is
a
buried
nail
Inside
of
this
heart
of
stone
so
you
wanna
get
married
Well
Romeo
Romeo
smokin
blow
with
Antonio
In
the
back
alley
takin
shots
of
whiskey
and
only
gold
Juliets
at
the
nudie
bar
doin
God
only
knows
Neither
one
of
em
came
to
see
the
dog
and
the
pony
show
But
a
bitch
is
a
bitch
and
a
horse
is
a
horse
And
Im
sorry
I
cant
afford
to
get
your
daddys
old
Porsche
painted
Sorry
Juliet
that
you
embedded
the
sayin
If
a
dollar
makes
you
holler
then
Im
gettin
the
short
change
of
it
Feel
like
Ive
been
asleepin
alone
and
lovin
this
angel
Tangled
between
a
dream
and
a
coma
Walkin
the
edge
of
this
cliff
like
a
sheep
to
its
owner
Then
wake
up
to
this
fuckin
bitch
with
an
evil
persona
Now
if
you
say
that
you
hate
somebody
and
you
livin
with
them
Then
they
pack
up
and
leave
and
you
bitch
about
how
you
miss
em
You
gotta
see
the
pattern
of
the
blood
all
over
the
steerin
wheel
Love
is
a
cannibal
ridin
a
carnival
carousel
Round
and
round
we
roll
where
it
stops
baby
nobody
knows
Some
people
go
crazy
and
they
lose
control
Some
people
jump
off
some
people
wont
let
go
Some
people
say
love
some
people
say
why
Some
people
dont
love
they
just
want
a
free
ride
The
rain
wont
stop
itll
never
dry
If
shes
in
the
house
of
pain
then
love
is
standin
outside
Shes
twisted
hes
a
rebel

shes
set
hes
hard
to
handle
The
worst
part
of
all
is
he
just
dont
care
Shes
twisted
like
a
rope
that
is
wrapped
around
his
throat
But
the
worst
part
of
all
is
she
really
dont
give
a
She
dont
give
a
shit
Maybe
Im
a
twisted
one
that
screwing
this
up
So
I
guess
this
means
Goodbye
for
now
I
feel
phenomenal
as
usual
Pharmaceuticals
glue
sniff
and
pools
of
vomit
at
Bonnaroo
But
I
dont
know
if
Im
in
Tennessee
Chicago
or
Houston
In
the
corner
trying
to
seek
solitude
Shallow
but
such
a
hollow
dude
I
wont
even
swallow
solid
food
Alcoholic
too
plus
Im
on
lean
like
the
Tower
of
Pisa
Top
it
off
Im
on
mushrooms
so
fuck
all
of
you
Roses
to
violet
mollies
are
blue
Lost
in
a
ball
of
confusion
Its
all
an
illusion
Its
probably
the
shrooms
Im
on
Cause
I
think
I
started
hallucinating
Cause
I
just
thought
I
just
heard
Jay
Electronica
and
Odd
Futures
new
shit
And
all
I
can
do
is
follow
the
music
And
end
up
with
Paula
Abdul
at
Lollapalooza
Fillin
water
balloons
with
nail
polish
remover
Just
a
problem
in
wallowing
fumes
I
feel
a
type
I
gotta
get
looser
After
I
finish
polishing
off
this
bottle
of
booze
I
got
a
solution
Concentrated
like
orange
juice
so
Im
not
as
diluted
Cause
all
this
delusion
got
me
seein
shit
Excusez-moi
but
that
coochie
that
passed
You
see
her
ass
Wouldnt
make
her
my
main
squeeze
but
Juicier
ass
it
belongs
in
a
juicer
Its
mouth
waterin
too
so
I
walked
up
to
it
like
Im
Marshall
Wanna
try
to
meet
my
standards
Ill
Introduce
ya
Oh
Im
a
misogynist
too
but
Im
not
a
masseuse
But
my
attitude
is
rubbin
off
on
the
youth
A
chronic
abuser
not
only
user
of
marijuana
I
mean
verbal
assault
that
I
use
to
smoke
all
of
you
losers
Got
a
bazooka
a
shotgun
a
ruger
a
Glock
and
a
nuke
And
a
Rottweiler
too
Im
not
in
the
mood
so
When
I
say
Im
bringing
the
tec
out
Im
not
coming
to
repair
your
fuckin
electronic
computers
God
Im
gonna
puke
Im
so
gone
off
the
hookah
I
think
I
swallowed
a
loser
Im
tore
up
demolished
a
fuckin
stone
like
Oliver
Like
I
looked
Medusa
in
the
eyeball
to
seduce
her
The
thoughts
I
produce
are
The
thoughts
I
produce
are
loony
tunes
With
latex
gloves
and
the
socks
and
shoes
To
replace
next
up
Veronicas
boobs
And
a
paychecks
that
were
stuffed
in
a
glove
box
In
a
blue
honda
with
used
condoms
were
clues
the
The
girl
was
just
not
the
one
suitable
for
him
Right
for
me
Will
change
me
rearrange
my
head
to
be
Just
right
for
you
and
me
dont
laugh
please
listen
Dont
laugh
please
listen
Thought
Id
give
in
into
the
pressure
Collapse
and
crumble
perhaps
Relapsing
under
that
Well
thats
a
bunch
of
crap
In
the
clutch
Im
the
Captain
Crunch
of
rap
And
Im
sick
in
fact
and
humble
thats
enough
of
that
Fuck
that
shit
cut
the
sack
Like
its
a
natural
reaction
Thats
why
Im
actually
trapped
in
this
shoving
match
Cause
push
keeps
coming
to
that
I
can
keep
getting
my
ass
kicked
keep
it
coming
back
Like
a
sarcastic
crumpled
sack
of
shit
so
mad
Disgruntled
had
some
struggles
yeah
But
that
passionate
hungers
back
The
fantastic
juggling
act
And
the
way
I
flip
my
tongue
on
the
track
Its
like
verbal
acrobatics
But
in
fact
Last
time
I
tried
to
pull
off
a
dramatic
stunt
as
drastic
I
fuckin
crashed
my
hovercraft
After
I
strapped
the
duffel
bag
to
my
back
And
stuck
the
massive
punchin
bag
in
it
An
elastic
bungee
strap
proper
plaster
a
thumb
tack
And
a
piece
of
plastic
bubble
wrap
Went
spastic
and
fuckin
snapped
Jumped
and
splashed
in
a
puddle
of
battery
acid
Stumbled
back
recovered
back
flipped
And
landed
on
a
gymnastic
tumble
mat
And
for
my
last
trick
lunge
on
back
lash
On
a
NASA
shuttle
flap
fuckin
snapped
the
rudder
in
half
Chuckled
and
laughed
buttaled
my
last
rebuttal
And
just
asked
him
to
come
crash
And
I
go
grab
my
go-go-gadget
inflatable
gigantic
humongous
mattress
And
ceramic
construction
hat
Rubbed
my
magic
mushroom
tat
Fell
off
then
splat
get
up
from
that
Face
taped
to
a
waste
paper
basket
Throw
up
then
gas
lungs
collapse
And
thats
more
likely
to
find
someone
that
Right
for
me
Will
change
me
rearrange
my
head
to
be
Just
right
for
you
and
me
dont
laugh
please
listen
Dont
laugh
please
listen
Couple
of
shots
of
Jäger
Public
intoxication
dis-fuckin-combobulation
Fluttered
with
thoughts
of
anger
While
I
was
away
I
know
probably
some
of
you
got
to
thinkin
Youre
top
ten
aint
cha
stop
cause
you
fuckers
are
talkin
crazy
And
stop
interrupting
youre
not
even
up
in
the
conversation
Whether
youre
punchin
a
clock
or
famous
Underground
pop
or
nameless
whatever
your
job
is
I
cant
fuck
with
your
occupation
Youre
thinkin
just
cause
you
came
in
with
scrubs
And
you
brought
the
scalpel
and
sponge
The
oxygen
tank
and
the
suction
and
shot
the
brain
surgeon
Stuck
in
the
operating
room
Once
you
done
swapped
your
name
with
him
Smuggled
in
Ronald
Reagan
If
you
duck
him
up
Donald
Fagen
While
juggling
waffles
baking
Fuckin
McDonalds
egg
and
cheese
sausage
bagel
finagle
They
flung
it
across
the
table
Then
bump
it
and
knock
it
shake
it
Jumped
and
got
in
the
way
then
disrupted
my
concentration
I
said
fuck
it
and
lost
my
patience
Since
they
all
woke
up
from
sedation
Aint
none
of
you
Doctor
Dre
So
then
what
does
it
got
you
thinkin
That
you
can
fuck
with
this
operation
Aftermath
still
running
hip-hop
amazing
Im
still
pluggin
along
No
need
for
an
assumption
Heres
confirmation
Im
up
for
the
long
duration
Im
just
looking
for
something
to
walk
away
with
Some
pocket
change
and
a
little
integrity
Though
Ill
probably
be
jumpin
across
the
stage
Till
Im
fuckin
Madonnas
age
Stuck
in
an
awkward
place
in
my
life
But
I
shit
you
not
like
Im
fucked
up
with
constipation
That
day
will
come
before
I
stumble
upon
some
ladies
Right
for
me
Will
change
me
rearrange
my
head
to
be
Just
right
for
you
and
me
dont
laugh
please
listen
Dont
laugh
please
listen
Tell
em
if
they
want
it
they
can
come
get
that
static
I
swear
I
love
my
city
I
just
want
a
little
static
See
me
they
salute
me
they
aint
ready
for
that
static
Detroit
vs
Everybody
I
took
a
bite
out
the
rotten
apple
by
the
poison
tree
All
these
females
need
to
email
to
make
noise
And
I
think
its
changin
a
lot
he
fuck
with
my
authority
Then
he
shall
see
shells
but
not
by
the
seashore
If
he
gang
bangin
or
not
Its
simple
as
the
alphabet
He
F
with
me
that
G
shall
surely
see
He
definitely

bout
it
its
retail
fraud
hes
weak
The
honest
gesture
the
trigger
finger
round
the
diamond
tester
we
tail
flaw
with
heat
The
same
soldier
its
me
myself
and
I
Ridin
round
shootin
my
biopic
and

autobiography
Range
Rover

Eagles

an
ambulance
My
parachute
like
skydivin
in
Hammer
pants
So
call
it
siblin
rivalry
Take
his
life
call
it
the
unforgivable
robbery
A
wise
man
told
me
that
holdin
a
grudge
is
like
Lettin
somebody
just
live
inside
of
your
head
rent
free
Real

Twenty

From

In

Or

laborin
for
years
I

way
longer
than
nine
months
but
fuck

all
in
due
time
I
turned
a
blunt
to
a
roach
with
dreams
of
bein
a
Beatle
though
Dont
want
to
I
need
to
gotta
learn
to
keep
it
cerebral
When
you
come
up
in
a
place
where
everyone
got
a
piece
but

peaceful
This
is
just
part

sequel
Tell

static
I

See

Detroit

Everybody
Comin

streets
where

Just
a
step
away
from
felon
thats
why
they
call
it
the
D
On
your
bleeder
ho
reason
for
all
of
this
honesty
Honestly

streets
Cause
Im
a
Linwood
nigga
them
young
niggas

Put

your
head

lake
on
Grand
River
And

Know

Swisher

So

Im
a

my
letterman
I
had
Ks
in

ya
school
but
I
aint
go
to
Kettering
Cough
up
a
lung
313
where
Im
from
Xan

cross
eyed
like
Bernsteins
son
And
these
niggas
try
to
copy
but
I
hold
on
this
time
Its
us
vs
them
Detroit
vs
Everybody
Lately
it
seems
as
if
its
me
against
the
world
Like
it
was
before
my
life
became
a
movie
And
they
used
to
use
my
mothafuckin
trailer
to
tease
me
with
But
I
flipped
that
script
like
AB
filler
Painkillers
to
pop
that
lid
off
that
safety
seal
It
made
me
feel
amazing
made
me
celebrate
me
And
if
I
may
reiterate
I
aint
even
need
a
script
I
aint
bein
conceited
But
I
made
it
to
radio
eat
a
dick
I
still
never
ABC
the
shit
Mainstream
appeal
and
the
skill
is
what
made
me
iller
Since
before
they
called
Jay
Dee
Dilla
I
was
daydreamin
one
day
I
would
be
the
shit
And
if
I
ever
end
up
escapin
the
streets
I
swear
that
I
would
stay
here
Still
in
it
Im
crazy
Ill
always
be
real
Dont
make
me
steal
an
18
wheeler
Break
all
of
my
friends
out
of
here
and
take
em
straight
to
the
Mercedes
dealer
Peel
off
back
to
the
same
block
that
we
came
from
on
a
rampage
You
crazy
for
me
to
flip
Whats
makin
you
think
I
need
a
switch
Cause
Im
Adrian
Peterson
When
hes
raging
and
heated
and
on
the
way
to
go
beat
his
kid
On
the
track
I
spank
like
he
just
did
DETROIT
I
cant
never
leave
this
bitch
Sick
of
bein
treated
like
me
and
shit
But
Jesus
I
can
just
see
why
people
quit
callin
me
to
do
features
And
them
cyphers
on
BET
cause
if
I
wasnt
me
I
probably
wouldnt
want
to
play
with
me
neither
shit
Seems
to
be
reachin
this
fever
pitch
180
degrees
in
here
trying
to
wait
for
the
cedar
chips
MCs
just
bit
off
more
than
they
can
chew
like
a
face
full
of
Swedish
Fish
Or
Lorena
with
two
penises
Hateful
ingeniousness
this
inconvenience
And
for
the
record
you
wont
want
this
kind
of
static
in
your
life
When
Im
makin
you
cling
to
it
They
consider
tryna
reinsulate
yah
when
its
maybe
in
for
another
crazy
winter
Its
so
cold
in
the
D
it
is
as
days
begin
to
tick
away
But
aint
this
what
really
made
me
into
the
angry
bitter
blonde
Sick
of
bein
underdog
Dont
make
me
unleash
this
shit
release
this
Pit
May
even
seem
as
if
Im
yankin
your
chain
a
bit
or
maybe
the
way
in
which
Im
sayin
shit
Is
playin
with
your
relation
changin
it
Its
still
the
same
and
Shadys
still
a
lady
killer
Since
the
day
I
went
insane
and
attacked
the
baby
sitter
With
a
potato
peeler
and
mushed
her
face
into
the
entertainment
center
Its
like
another
plane
just
entered
into
Ukraine
again
The
Bermuda
Triangle
and
attempted
to
make
a
safe
descent
Awaiting
anyone
who
aint
affiliated
it
could
be
danger
Did
you
make
arrangements
with
the
gangsters
fore
you
came
here
And
if
they
mention
us
Tell
em
if
they
want
it
they
can
come
get
that
static
I
swear
I
love
my
city
I
just
want
a
little
static
See
me
they
salute
me
they
aint
ready
for
that
static
Detroit
vs
Everybody
What
up
though
its
the
godfather
Trick
Trick
You
either
ridin
with
us
or
gettin
rolled
on
That
means
Detroit
vs
Everybody
Hey
Em
let
me
get
that
instrumental
take
it
down
to
the
hood
let
the
little
homies
get
this
remix
crackin
Detroit
Look
if
you
had
one
shot
one
opportunity
To
seize
everything
you
ever
wanted-One
moment
Would
you
capture
it
or
just
let
it
slip
His
palms
are
sweaty
knees
weak
arms
are
heavy
Theres
vomit
on
his
sweater
already
moms
spaghetti
Hes
nervous
but
on
the
surface
he
looks
calm
and
ready
To
drop
bombs
but
he
keeps
on
forgettin
What
he
wrote
down
the
whole
crowd
goes
so
loud
He
opens
his
mouth
but
the
words
wont
come
out
Hes
chokin
how
everybodys
jokin
now
The
clocks
run
out
times
up
over
bloah
Snap
back
to
reality
Oh
there
goes
gravity
Oh
there
goes
Rabbit
he
choked
Hes
so
mad
but
he
wont
give
up
that
Easy
no
He
wont
have
it

he
knows
his
whole
backs
to
these
ropes
It
dont
matter
hes
dope
He
knows
that
but
hes
broke
Hes
so
stacked
that
he
knows
When
he
goes
back
to
his
mobile
home
thats
when
its
Back
to
the
lab
again
yo
This
whole
rap
shit
He
better
go
capture
this
moment
and
hope
it
dont
pass
him
You
better
lose
yourself
in
the
music
the
moment
You
own
it
you
better
never
let
it
go
You
only
get
one
shot
do
not
miss
your
chance
to
blow
This
opportunity

The
souls
escaping
through
this
hole
that
its
gaping
This
world
is
mine
for
the
taking
Make
me
king
as
we
move
toward
a
new
world
order
A
normal
life
is
borin
but
superstardoms
close
to
post
mortem
It
only
grows
harder
only
grows
hotter
He
blows
us
all
over
these
hoes
is
all
on
him
Coast
to
coast
shows
hes
know
as
the
globetrotter
Lonely
roads
God
only
knows
Hes
grown
farther
from
home
hes
no
father
He
goes
home
and
barely
knows
his
own
daughter
But
hold
your
nose
cuz
here
goes
the
cold
water
His
hoes
dont
want
him
no
mo
hes
cold
product
They
moved
on
to
the
next
schmoe
who
flows
He
nose
dove
and
sold
nada
So
the
soap
opera
is
told
and
unfolds
I
suppose
its
old
partna
but
the
beat
goes
on
Da

No
more
games
Ima
change
what
you
call
rage
Tear
this
mothafuckin
roof
off
like
2
dogs
caged
I
was
playin
in
the
beginnin
the
mood
all
changed
I
been
chewed
up
and
spit
out
and
booed
off
stage
But
I
kept
rhymin
and
stepwritin
the
next
cypher
Best
believe
somebodys
payin
the
pied
piper
All
the
pain
inside
amplified
by
the
fact
That
I
cant
get
by
with
my
9
to
5
And
I
cant
provide
the
right
type
of
life
for
my
family
Cuz
man
these
goddam
food
stamps
dont
buy
diapers
And
its
no
movie
theres
no
Mekhi
Phifer
this
is
my
life
And
these
times
are
so
hard
and
its
getting
even
harder
Tryin
to
feed
and
water
my
seed
plus
See
dishonor
caught
up
between
being
a
father
and
a
prima
donna
Baby
mama
dramas
screamin
on
and
Too
much
for
me
to
wanna
Stay
in
one
spot
another
day
of
monotony
Has
gotten
me
to
the
point
Im
like
a
snail
Ive
got
to
formulate
a
plot
fore
I
end
up
in
jail
or
shot
Success
is
my
only
mothafuckin
option
failures
not
Mom
I
love
you
but
this
trailers
got
to
go
I
cannot
grow
old
in
Salems
lot
So
here
I
go
is
my
shot
Feet
fail
me
not
cuz
maybe
the
only
opportunity
that
I
got
You
better
lose
yourself
in
the
music
the
moment
You
own
it
you
better
never
let
it
go
You
only
get
one
shot
do
not
miss
your
chance
to
blow
This
opportunity
comes

You
better
lose
yourself
in
the
music
the
moment
You
own
it
you
better
never
let
it
go
You
only
get
one
shot
do
not
miss
your
chance
to
blow
This
opportunity
comes
once
in
a
lifetime
yo
You
can
do
anything
you
set
your
mind
to
man
I
walk
on
water
But
I
aint
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
But
only
when
it
freezes
fuck
Why
are
expectations
so
high
Is
it
the
bar
I
set
My
arms
I
stretch
but
I
cant
reach
A
far
cry
from
it
or
its
in
my
grasp
but
as
Soon
as
I
grab
squeeze
I
lose
my
grip
like
the
flying
trapeze
Into
the
dark
I
plummet
Now
the
skys
blackening
I
know
the
marks
high
Butterflies
rip
apart
my
stomach
Knowing
that
no
matter
what
bars
I
come
with
Youre
gonna
hark
gripe
and
thats
a
hard
Vicodin
to
swallow
So
I
scrap
these
as
pressure
increases
like
khakis
I
feel
the
ice
cracking
because
I
walk
on
water
But
I
aint
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
But
only
when
it
freezes
Its
the
curse
of
the
standard
That
the
first
of
the
Mathers
disc
set
Always
in
search
of
the
verse
that
I
havent
spit
yet
Will
this
step
just
be
another
misstep
To
tarnish
whatever
the
legacy
love
or
respect
Ive
garnered
The
rhyme
has
to
be
perfect
the
delivery
flawless
And
it
always
feels
like
Im
hitting
the
mark
TIl
I
go
sit
in
the
car
listen
and
pick
it
apart
Like
this
shit
is
garbage
Gods
given
me
all
this
Still
I
feel
no
different
regardless
Kids
look
to
me
like
as
a
god
this
is
retarded
If
only
they
knew
its
a
facade
and
its
exhaustive
And
I
try
to
not
listen
to
nonsense
But
if
you
bitches
are
trying
to
strip
me
of
my
confidence
Mission
accomplished
Im
not
God-sent
Nas
Rakim
Pac
BIG
James
Todd
Smith
and
Im
not
Prince
so
I
walk
on
water
But
I
aint
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
But
only
when
it
freezes
Cause
Im
only
human
just
like
you
Making
my
mistakes
oh
if
you
only
knew
I
dont
think
you
should
believe
in
me
the
way
that
you
do
Cause
Im
terrified
to
let
you
down
oh
Its
true
Im
a
Rubiks
a
beautiful
mess
At
times
juvenile
yes
I
goof
and
I
jest
A
flawed
human
I
guess
But
Im
doing
my
best
to
not
ruin
your
ex-
pectations
and
meet
em
but
first
the
Speedom
verse
Now
Big
Sean
hes
going
too
fast
Is
he
gonna
shout
or
curse
out
his
mom
There
was
a
time
I
had
the
world
by
the
balls
eating
out
my
palm
Every
album
song
I
was
spazzin
the
fuck
out
on
And
now
Im
getting
clowned
and
frowned
on
But
the
only
one
whos
looking
down
on
me
that
matters
nows
Deshaun
Am
I
lucky
to
be
around
this
long
Begs
the
question
though
Especially
after
the
methadone
As
yesterday
fades
and
the
Dresden
home
is
burnt
to
the
ground
And
all
thats
left
of
my
house
is
lawn
The
crowds
are
gone
And
its
time
to
wash
out
the
blonde
Sales
decline
the
curtains
drawn
Theyre
closing
the
set
Im
still
poking
my
head
out
from
behind
And
everyone
who
has
doubt
remind
Now
take
your
best
rhyme
outdo
it
now
do
it
a
thousand
times
Now
let
em
tell
ya
the
world
no
longer
cares
or
gives
a
fuck
about
your
rhymes
And
as
I
grow
outta
sight
outta
mind
I
might
go
outta
mine
Cause
how
do
I
ever
let
this
mic
go
without
a
fight
When
I
made
a
fuckin
tightrope
outta
twine
But
when
I
do
fall
from
these
heights
though
Ill
be
fine
I
wont
pout
or
cry
or
spiral
down
or
whine
But
Ill
decide
if
its
my
final
bow
this
time
around
cause
I
walk
on
water
But
I
aint
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
But
only
when
it
freezes
Cause
Im
only
human
just
like
you
Making
my
mistakes
oh
if
you
only
knew
I
dont
think
you
should
believe
in
me
the
way
that
you
do
Cause
Im
terrified
to
let
you
down
oh
If
I
walked
on
water
I
would
drown
Cause
Im
just
a
man
but
as
long
as
I
got
a
mic
Im
godlike
So
me
and
you
are
not
alike
Bitch
I
wrote
Stan
And
I
started
from
the
bottom
Like
a
snowman
ground
up
Like
round
chuck
and
still
put
hands
on
you
Staying
wound
up
is
how
I
spend
time
Sucker
free
confidence
high
Such
a
breeze
when
I
pin
rhymes
I
just
got
the
air
about
me
Like
wind
chimes
yeah
Another
day
in
the
life
uh
Used
to
have
to
scrape
to
get
by
yeah
Now
my
community
is
gated
And
I
made
it
and
my
neighbors
say
hi
say
hi
Im
giving
them
pounds
Im
upscale
now
Guess
it
means
Im
way
in
the
sky
But
I
still
remember
the
days
of
minimal
wage
for
General
labor
welfare
recipients
is
a
minor
Look
at
how
government
assistance
has
made
ya
Adversity
if
at
first
if
you
dont
succeed
Put
your
temper
to
more
use
cause
being
broke
is
a
poor
excuse
That
shit
only
gives
you
more
fuel
Show
them
why
youre
you
So
close
God
its
like
I
almost
got
it
But
close
only
counts
in
timebombs
and
horseshoes
So
I
uni-bomb
shit
tick
tick
tick
No
remorse
Screw
it
Im
lit
and
that
attitude
I
blew
up
on
quick
Thats
why
they
call
me
firecracker
I
grew
up
on
wick
wick
wick
wick
with
a
short
fuse
I
got
some
important
news
to
report
to
Anyone
who
thought
I
was
done
nah
bitch
not
quite
Spotlights
back
on
got
my
faith
wheres
yours
Do
you
still
believe
In
me
Didnt
I
get
everything
I
had
to
give
you
to
make
you
see
Ill
never
forget
if
you
turn
your
back
on
me
Now
and
walk
out
I
will
never
let
you
live
it
down
Ill
never
quit
Do
you
still
believe
In
me
Man
I
know
sometimes
these
thoughts
can
be
harsh
and
cold
as
ice
To
me
theyre
just
ink
blots
I
just
fling
them
like
slingshots
and
so
precise
So
you
might
want
to
think
it
over
twice
When
you
retards
can
roll
the
dice
But
beef
will
at
least
cost
you
your
career
Cause
even
my
cheap
shots
are
overpriced
But
this
middle
fingers
free
as
a
bird
New
warhead-ed
birth
you
just
forehead-ed
on
earth
Too
short
for
a
verse
studied
his
formula
Learned
how
to
incorporate
a
curse
Point
it
towards
corporate
America
Stick
a
fork
in
it
and
turn
Cause
four-letter
words
are
more
better
Heard
the
world
force-fed
a
turd
to
me
Youre
getting
yours
But
sometimes
I
overdo
it
But
I
just
get
so
into
it
I
was
there
consoling
you
when
no
one
knew
it
When
your
situation
showed
no
improvement
I
was
that
door
you
walked
over
to
it
Im
the
light
at
the
end
of
tunnel
so
people
are
always
looking
at
me
as
theyre
going
through
it
When
that
tunnel
vision
is
unclear
shit
becomes
too
much
to
bear
Since
Cleaning
Out
My
Closet
when
I
was
having
trouble
with
the
snare
Im
that
unrealistic
prayer
answered
And
Ima
get
you
jacked
up
like
youre
trying
to
fix
a
flat
uh
when
you
struggle
with
the
spare
That
double
fisted
bear
knuckles
coupled
with
this
pair
of
nuts
Im
cupping
I
am
your
fucking
switch
nothing
can
compare
Do
you
still
believe
In
me
Didnt
I
get
everything
I
had
to
give
you
to
make
you
see
Ill
never
forget
if
you
turn
your
back
on
me
Now
and
walk
out
I
will
never
let
you
live
it
down
Ill
never
quit
Do
you
still
believe
In
me
Started
from
the
bottom
like
a
snowman
Oh
man
put
that
in
your
corncob
pipe
and
smoke
that
But
my
batterys
low
Im
gonna
need
a
booster
in
my
pack
I
know
I
always
got
Proof
on
my
back
I
called
you
a
groupie
cause
I
knew
for
a
fact
My
insulin
ho
Homie
Im
calling
on
you
cause
I
think
Im
slowly
startin
to
lose
faith
in
it
so
Give
me
that
inkling
and
motivation
to
go
Motivation
to
go
Hussein
with
the
flow
Fake
fans
with
the
two-faced
that
show
Let
heartbeats
loot
produce
hate
in
my
soul
Laying
vocals
two
days
in
a
row
True
statement
hate
to
go
down
this
road
But
theres
only
one
route
to
cross
this
bridge
So
I
walk
in
this
bitch
with
loose
chains
Cause
all
my
dues
paid
But
this
booth
is
taking
its
toll
But
its
never
too
late
to
start
a
new
beginning
That
goes
for
you
too
So
what
the
fuck
you
gon
do
use
the
tools
youre
given
Or
are
you
going
to
use
the
cards
you
were
dealt
as
an
excuse
for
you
to
not
do
shit
with
them
I
used
to
play
the
loser
victim
Til
I
saw
the
way
Proof
was
driven
I
found
my
vehicle
and
I
havent
ran
out
of
gas
yet
And
when
they
stacked
decks
turn
handicaps
into
assets
Fanny
packs
hourglasses
If
time
was
still
on
my
side
Id
still
have
none
to
waste
Man
in
my
younger
days
that
dream
was
so
much
fun
to
chase
Its
like
I
run
in
place
while
this
shit
dangled
in
front
of
my
face
But
how
do
you
keep
up
the
pace
and
the
hunger
pains
once
youve
won
the
race
When
that
pool
of
exhaust
is
cooling
off
Cause
you
dont
got
nothing
left
to
prove
at
all
Cause
you
done
already
hit
them
with
the
coup
de
grâce
Still
you
feel
the
need
To
go
through
and
deal
with
that
Bruce
Willis
That
blue
still
that
truth
still
When
that
wheels
loose
I
wont
lose
will
Do
you
still
believe
Instinctive
nature
to
bring
the
anguish
yeah
to
the
English
language
With
this
ink
you
haters

wrote
on
like
a
piece
of
paper
This
rap

your
house
Cause

Ending

Then
we

end
up
spending
the
night
And
Im
skinning
your

a
Budweiser
truck
Finds
a
slut

Fuck

Flies

Happily

And

My

And

Hands

Then
pull
your
pants
up
promise

We
may
never
understand
each
other
its
no
use
We
aint
ever
gonna
grasp
what
each
other
goes
through
Black

we
aint
gonna
lie
to
you
Black
boy
black

we
dont
like
the
sight
of
you
Pull
up
on
the
side
of
you
Window
rolled
down
profiled
And
then
we
wonder
why
we
see
this
side
of
you
Probably
coming
from
the
dope
house
We
can
let
you
slide
but
your
tail
light
is
blew
out
We
know
youre
hiding
that
Heidi
Klum
on
you
And
youre
on
another
drug
charge
homie
its
back
inside
for
you
And
just
in
case
a
chase
might
ensue
we
got
that
tried
and
true
pistol
drew
right
at
you
we
be
delighted
to
unload
it
In
your
bedroom
walk
up
and
lay
that
taser
in
the
side
of
you
What
the
fuck
am
I
gonna
do
I
keep
telling
myself
keep
doing
like
youre
doing
No
matter
how
many
lives
you
ruin
Its
for
the
red
white
and
blue
Time
to
go
find
a
new
one
and
split
his
head
right
in
two
No
ones
ever
indicted
you
Why
Cause
youre
a
white
boy
white
boy
Youre
a
rockstar
My
momma
talk
to
me
Try
to
tell
me
how
to
live
White
boy
white
boy
in
your
cop
car
But
I
dont
listen
to
her
Cause
my
head
is
like
a
sieve
White
boy
white
boy
youre
untouchable
The
worlds
coming
to
an
end
I
dont
even
care
Nobody
can
tell
me
shit
cause
Im
a
big
rockstar
Black
boy
black
boy
we
dont
get
your
culture
and
We
dont
care
what
our
governments
done
to
fuck
you
over
man
Dont
tell
us
your
attitudes
a
result
of
that
Balderdash
whered
you
get
the
chip
on
your
shoulder
at
Why
you
kicking
that
soda
can
Pull
your
pants
up
We
bought
to
roll
up
and
Throw
your
ass
in
the
van
cuffed
You
dont
have
to
know
our
plan
or
what
our
intentions
are
Our
guns
are
close
to
our
chest
You
better
show
your
hands
And
put
our
minds
more
at
ease
And
youll
get
shot
in
the
thyroid
cause
you
might
die
boy
We
fighting
a
crime
war
Here
come
the
swine
Tryna
clean
up
these
streets
from
all
these
minorities
Thats
why
we
call
them
pigstyes
for
Theyre
like
eyesores
to
police
Talk
to
you
like
youre
a
piece
of
trash
Feels
like
were
stuck
in
a
time
warp
to
me
As
I
kick
these
facts
and
Get
these
mixed
reactions
As
this
beat
backspins
It
like
were
drifting
back
into
the
60s
Having
black-skin
is
risky
cause
this
keeps
happening
Throughout
history
African-Americans
have
been
treated
like
shit
And
I
admit
there
have
been
times
where
its
been
embarrassing
to
be
a
Cause
youre
a
white
boy
white
boy
Youre
a
rockstar
My
momma
talk
to
me
Try
to
tell
me
how
to
live
White
boy
white
boy
in
your
cop
car
But
I
dont
listen
to
her
Cause
my
head
is
like
a
sieve
White
boy
white
boy
youre
untouchable
The
worlds
coming
to
an
end
I
dont
even
care
Nobody
can
tell
me
shit
cause
Im
a
big
rockstar
Seems
like
the
average
lifespan
of
a
white
man
Is
more
than
twice
that
of
a
black
life-spanner
Wonder
if
sometimes
it
has
a
fight
scanner
I
feel
like
checking
out
on
life
cant
escape
my
circumstance
Id
rather
hear
them
say
Die
N-word
than
Die
Antwoord
Ninja
now
its
better
to
describe
banter
But
thats
life
Strapped
cause
were
strapped
financially
And
cant
find
answers
Were
applying
for
McDonalds
It
seems
like
the
only
franchise
thatll
hire
so
how
can
we
have
higher
standards
As
Dallas
overshadows
the
battle
for
Black
Lives
Matter
We
fight
back
with
violence
But
acts
like
that
are
Black
eyes
on
the
movement
Which
makes
wack
lives
madder
At
cops
and
cops
madder
And
thats
why
its
at
a
stalemate
Cant
arrive
at
a
compromise
so
its
Black
Ops
I
wonder
if
we
hire
more
black
cops
the
crap
stops
The
block
is
our
backyard
offices
Not
the
crack
spot
Call
the
attack
dogs
off
of
us
man
You
always
act
pissed
off
at
us
a
traffic
stop
And
bad
cops
fuck
it
up
for
good
cops
And
man
stop
sending
white
cops
into
black
neighborhoods
Cause
they
aint
acclimated
to
em
Like
thats
the
way
to
do
it
Whos
seen
some
fuckin
videos
of
rappers
waving
guns
And
no
nobody
black
so
they
act
afraid
of
us
And
thats
racism
Fear
to
the
black
face
gives
them
A
subconscious
racist
Wait
why
is
there
black
neighborhoods
Cause
America
segregated
us
Designated
us
to
an
area
Separated
us
Section-eightd
us
When
we
tear
it
ups
the
only
time
attentions
paid
to
us
And
education
sucks
every
days
another
Freddie
Grey
for
us
a
levy
breaks
or
fuzz
Why
is
it
they
treat
us
like
dryer
lint
We
just
want
a
safe
environment
for
our
kids
but
cant
escape
The
sirens
Dont
take
a
scientist
to
see
our
violent
nature
lies
In
The
poverty
that
we
face
so
the
crime
rates
the
highest
in
The
lowest
classes
its
like
a
razor
wire
fence
And
were
trapped
in
these
racial
biases
That
plague
our
society
which
makes
our
anxiety
levels
raise
Every
time
we
see
a
devils
face
Lions
tigers
and
bears
oh
my
More
like
billy
clubs
and
Gats
And
we
really
love
it
when
you
think
were
guilty
cause
Were
black
But
you
kill
each
other
facts-
you
peel
each
Others
caps
for
silly
stuff
like
hats
Single
mother
strugglin
through
substance
abuse
While
people
with
nothing
to
lose
shoot
each
other
for
shoes
Fuck
your
republican
views
Pull
ourselves
up
by
our
bootstraps
where
the
fuck
is
the
boots
And
streets
act
as
a
narrator
Dont
gotta
read
comics
Or
be
that
into
characters
just
to
see
that
just
to
be
black
you
better
be
strapped
with
a
derringer-
or
be
capped
in
America
like
Steve
Rogers
Cause
no
one
overseas
these
cops
and
Always
see
some
B
charges
We
see
them
beat
Rodney
King
and
got
off
So
we
dont
need
all
your
crooked
police
peace
officer
offerings
Just
keep
marching
til
we
reach
congress
But
they
gonna
say
youre
tying
to
take
an
irrational
stance
cause
you
try
to
slander
the
flag
But
somebody
has
to
be
the
sacrificial
lamb
So
they
call
it
a
Kapernick
tantrum
if
you
dont
stand
for
the
national
anthem
We
raised
it
you
better
praise
it
or
youll
be
made
to
feel
like
a
traitor
well
Treat
you
like
Rodney
Dangerfield
Home
of
the
bravest
still
racist
spills
So
the
whole
nation
feels
like
a
plantation
field
In
a
country
that
claims
that
it
was
foundation
on
based
on
united
states
ideals
That
had
its
Natives
killed
Got
you
singing
the
Star
Spangled
Banner
to
a
piece
of
cloth
that
represents
the
land
of
the
free
that
made
people
slaves
to
build
Ive
been
a
liar
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover
been
a

All
my
sins
need
holy
water
feel
it
washin
over
me
A
little
one
I
dont
want
to
admit
to
something
If

Truth

Sweat

On

And
she

wants
to
exact
revenge
and
get

Its
a
chess
match
shes

his
back
like
a
jetpack
Shes
kept
track
of
all
his
internet
chats
And
guess

to
the
next
Actually

last
chick

Cause

And

But
shes
devised
some
plan
to
stab

in
the
back
Knife

relationships

a
strand
So

the
web

Gwen
Stacy

spite
her
man
And
I

Im
aloof
nervous
and
suited
When
its
too
hurt
but
what
you
deserve
is
the
truth
Dont
take
it
personal
I
just
cant
say
this
in
person
to
you
So
I
revert
to
the
studio
like
Hole
In
The
Wall
diners
Dont
have
to
be
reserved
in
a
booth
I
just
feel
like
the
person
who
Im
turnin
into
is
Irreversible
I
prayed
on
you
like
its
church
at
the
pew
And
now
that
I
got
you
I
dont
want
you
Took
advantage
of
my
thirst
to
pursue
Why
do
I
do
this
dirt
that
I
do
Get
on
my
soapbox
and
preach
my
sermon
in
speech
Detergent
and
bleach
is
burned
in
the
womb
Cause

with
her
in
the
womb
We
cant
bring
her
in
this
world
shoulda
knew
To
use
protection
fore
I
bit
into
your
forbidden
fruit
Fuck
Ive
been
a
liar
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover
been
a
cheat
All
my
sins
need
holy
water
feel
it
washin
over
me
A
little
one
I
dont
want
to
admit
to
something
If
all
its
gonna
cause
is
pain
The
truth
in
my
lies
now
are
falling
like
the
rain
So

river

If
life
was
a
highway
The
sequels

non-clay
But

swerving
in
five
lanes
Speeds

are
high
rave
like
Im
sliding
on
ice

Thats
what
I
made

made
You

This

wreck
tangled
What

I
say
It
was
fun
for
a
while
That
I
really
woulda
loved
your
smile
Didnt
really
wanna
abort
But

one
more
lie
to
tell
an
unborn
child
Ive
been
a
liar
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover
been
a
cheat
All
my
sins

holy
water

it
washin
over
me
A

one
I
dont
want

Everybody

This
is
where
is
where
terrorism
and
heroism
meets
square
up
in
the
streets
This
chump
barely
even
sleeps
All
he
does
is
watch
Fox
News
like
a
parrot
and
repeats
While
he
looks
like
a
canary
with
a
beak
Why
you
think
banned
transgenders
from
the
military
with
a
tweet
Hes
trying
to
divide
us
this
shits
like
a
cult
But
like
Johnny
hell
only
unite
us
Cuz
nothing
drives
us
inside
like
this
fight
does
Similar
to
when
two
cars
collide
cause
our
spirits
are
crushed
This
spots
a
tight
one
But
here
the
jaws
of
life
come
to
pull
us
from
the
wreckage
Thats
what
we
get
pride
from
When
we
cant
wear
stars
and
stripes
cause
this
type
of
pickle
were
in
is
hard
to
deal
But
theres
always
tomorrow
still
If
we
start
from
the
scratch
like
a
scab
for
scars
to
heal
And
band
together
for
Charolettesville
And
for
heavens
fallen
heroes
Fill
his
wall
with
murals
Nevada
get
up
Hit
the
damn
resetter
lets
start
from
zero
This
is
our
renewal
spray
tan
get
ride
of
Get
a
brand
new
better
America
And
heres
to
where
were
from
This
is
where
it
all
began
all
began
stand
up
Heres
to
the
land
that
made
me
And
made
me
who
I
am
who
I
am
hands
up
Heres
to
the
land
that
raised
me
Theres
home
for
the
only
place
that
really
knows
me
From
the
cracks
in
the
road
that
drove
me
Theres
no
place
like
home
Didnt
wanna
piss
your
base
off
did
ya
Cant
denounce
the
klan
cause
they
play
golf
with
ya
You
stay
on
Twitter
made
to
get
your
hate
off
Nazi
I
do
not
see
a
way
yall
differ
at
all
You
got
a
race
card
with
a
swastika
with
your
name
carved
in
it
Then
it
should
be
your
trademark
all
you
did
is
play
off
You
played
off
so
I
guess
it
pays
to
feed
off
of
chaos
So
basically
you
Adolf
Hitler
But
you
aint
ruining
our
country
punk
You
wont
take
our
pride
from
us
You
wont
define
us
Cause
like
a
dictionary
things
are
looking
up
So
much
got
a
sprained
neck
Knew
we
would
rise
up
Against
this
train
wreck
and
take
a
stand
Even
if
it
mean
sitting
when
they
raise
the
flag
This
aint
the
Star
Spangled
Banner
This
man
praised
a
statue
of
General
Lee
cause
He
generally
hates
the
black
people
degrades
hispanics
Take
it
back
to
the
Shady
national
convention
Wish
I
would
have
spit
on
him
before
I
went
to
shake
his
hand
at
the
event
Or
maybe
had
the
wherewithal
to
know
that
he
was
gonna
try
to
Thought
he
was
gonna
tear
apart
a
sacred
land
We
cherish
and
stand
for
so
Hands
in
the
air
lets
hear
it
for
The
start
of
a
brand
new
America
Without
him
we
can
be
proud
of
where
were
from
And
heres
to
where
were
from
This
is
where
it
all
began
all
began
stand
up
Heres
to
the
land
that
made
me
And
made
me
who
I
am
who
I
am
hands
up
Heres
to
the
land
that
raised
me
Theres
home
for
the
only
place
that
really
knows
me
From
the
cracks
in
the
road
that
drove
me
Theres
no
place
like
home
I
wont
give
up
I
wont
give
up
on
my
home
that
so
many
died
for
You
already
know
that
I
wont
give
up
I
wont
give
up
on
my
home
that
so
many
died
for
You
already
know
theres
no
place
like
home
no
place
like
home
Wherever
I
go
no
place
like
home
No
place
like
home
no
place
like
home
Wherever
I
go
This
is
where
it
all
began
all
began
stand
up
Heres
to
the
land
that
made
me
And
made
me
who
I
am
who
I
am
hands
up
Heres
to
the
land
that
raised
me
Theres
home
for
the
only
place
that
really
knows
me
From
the
cracks
in
the
road
that
drove
me
Theres
no
place
like
home
We
never
saw
from
each
others
sides
or
eye
to
eye
Just
eye
for
eye
lie
for
lie
fight
or
flight
So
much
baggage
need
a
luggage
rack
But
we
carry
on
with
our
public
spats
and
our
feuds
Oh
back
in
the
news
love
taps
when
I
dissed
you
Like
it
was
fun
actually
used
to
run
Back
to
the
booth
jump
back
in
the
studio
Give
you
a
tongue
lasher
than
you
Laughed
at
a
stomach
tat
with
the
tomb
Stoning
was
funny
back
in
our
youth
But
then
it
wasnt
after
we
knew
That
we
were
done
and
actually
through
and
actually
through
But
if
theres
one
fraction
of
truth
If
it
could
be
spun
back
I
would
do
so
many
things
different
Cause
it
was
such
a
dumbass
excuse
You
hit
me
once
and
that
I
would
use
To
continue
the
pattern
of
abuse
Why
did
I
punch
back
Girls
your
dad
is
a
scumbag
Im
confused
because
How
come
you
can
be
a
lord
and
a
loser
How
come
how
come
you
can
be
a
liar
and
a
good
father
A
good
dad
but
a
bad
husband
Why
are
you
a
good
father
A
great
dad
but
a
bad
husband
You
wouldnt
beat
our
love
with
a
writers
block
Just
a
line
thats
hot
that
I
forgot
We
laughed
a
little
cried
a
lot
Ill
never
forget
when
you
came
home
and
you
held
Hailie
Day
before
you
went
to
jail
and
daily
How
we
would
wait
for
that
mail
lady
Or
by
the
phone
for
mom
to
call
And
I
watch
you
pull
yourself
up
And
we
decided
on
giving
it
one
more
try
despite
it
all
Youre
my
lightning
rod
when
my
sky
gets
dark
Im
your
shiny
rocks
in
that
tiny
box
When
we
tied
the
knot
when
we
broke
the
knot
Every
line
we
crossed
we
were
supposed
to
not
Every
time
we
fought
being
stones
they
got
Thrown
too
far
Words
that
we
said
that
we
didnt
mean
The
words
that
we
meant
that
we
didnt
say
The
ones
that
we
thought
that
shoulda
said
Letters
written
that
we
coulda
read
Which
maybe
woulda
lead
to
some
good
instead
And
had
this
put
to
bed
But
Id
be
lying
still
if
I
wasnt
sitting
here
asking
myself
How
come
you
can
be
a
lord
and
a
loser
How
come
how
come
you
can
be
a
liar
and
a
good
father
A
good
dad
but
a
bad
husband
Why
are
you
a
good
father
A
great
dad
but
a
bad
husband
dad
you
said
Forever
be
a
hero
in
my
eyes
I
reply
But
theres
always
another
side
to
a
good
father
A
great
dad
but
a
bad
husband
We
brought
out
the
worst
in
each
other
Someone
had
to
make
the
sparring
end
Cause
I
loved
you
but
I
hated
that
me
And
I
dont
wanna
see
that
side
again
But
Im
sorry
Kim
More
than
you
could
ever
comprehend
Leaving
you
was
fucking
harder
than
Sawing
off
a
fucking
body
limb
Once
upon
a
time
where
all
we
had
Maybe
that
was
what
drew
us
to
each
other
It
was
true
love
shit
that
we
never
knew
was
possible
We
might
have
loved
each
other
too
much
And
maybe
thats
what
made
us
do
what
we
did
to
each
other
All
the
screw-ups
Cause
you
always
thought
that
you
was
more
in
love
with
me
And
I
was
thinking
I
was
more
in
love
than
you
was
For
all
the
times
that
we
thought
it
was
Til
we
saw
how
wrong
we
were
When
the
dust
settles
now
and
all
the
dirt
And
if
I
touch
the
rawest
nerve
all
I
want
is
for
us
not
to
hurt
And
its
been
an
exhaustive
search
to
find
the
words
But
I
just
heard
Mockingbird
And
got
the
urge
to
jot
me
some
verses
and
thoughts
The
purpose
was
not
to
stir
up
open
wounds
Ive
caused
got
a
few
and
so
have
you
Or
argue
whos
fault
it
was
partly
yours
partly
mine
But
really
no
ones
this
is
so
tough
Im
getting
choked
up
Oh
fuck
it
we
both
suck
We
broke
up
got
back
together
We
both
thought
we
had
forever
Not
bad
people
just
bad
together
We
was
so
nuts
backstab
each
other
Another
blow
struck
but
theres
no
ducking
this
blow
Cause
its
over
and
its
closure
But
Im
not
so
sure
how
to
close
this
I
just
dont
know
How
some
people
can
be
so
good
At
one
thing
and
so
fucked
at
a
whole
nother
shit
Its
no
wonder
How
come
you
can
be
a
lord
and
a
loser
How
come
how
come
you
can
be
a
liar
and
a
good
father
A
good
dad
but
a
bad
husband
Why
are
you
a
good
father
A
great
dad
but
a
bad
husband
dad
you
said
Forever
be
a
hero
in
my
eyes
I
reply
But
theres
always
another
side
to
a
good
father
A
great
dad
but
a
bad
husband
Im
stumbling
I
cant
see
straight
And
its
my
fault
I
got
this
way
I
got
my
hands
on
something
great
And
found
a
way
to
mess
it
all
up
I
did
my
best
I
tried
to
change
But
its
just
in
my
DNA
I
got
my
hands
on
something
great
And
found
a
way
to
fuck
it
up
again
Now
Im
the
one
thing
You
couldnt
hate
more
But
youre
the
one
thing
That
I
would
die
for
All
my
life
I
was
told
I
was
never
nothing
special
I
dont
need
to
be
reminded
of
it
every
other
second
Specially
when
all
my
self-esteems
already
shot
the
hell
up
Falling
helplessly
Im
embarrased
I
dont
want
no
one
else
to
see
Cause
I
feel
like
Im
a
piece
of
shit
every
time
she
yells
at
me
Selfishly
indeed
but
definitely
doesnt
help
that
she
Makes
me
feel
like
Ive
died
and
gone
to
heaven
but
makes
life
a
living
hell
for
me
She
does
that
thing
with
her
lip
now
shes
melting
me
Im
putty
in
her
palms
Im
wrapped
around
her
finger
A
yo-yo
on
a
string
she
lets
me
sit
there
and
just
dangle
Until
something
better
comes
along
and
shell
just
drop
me
like
a
hot
potato
I
look
like
Im
in
pain
but
Im
okay
though
Cause
I
know
she
loves
me
my
friends
what
do
they
know
Its
like
Im
drowning
at
sea
Hoping
that
you
reach
for
me
I
know
youre
there
but
I
cant
see
Cause
Im
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
Im
dying
to
breathe
And
all
you
do
is
strangle
me
Such
a
beautiful
relief
Cause
Im
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
Drunk
off
tragic
endings
In
my
moments
of
weakness
I
openly
admit
this
shit
I
wouldnt
normally
Im
extremely
self-conscious
and
enormously
Insecure
and
she
uses
it
to
torture
when
she
torments
me
It
only
turns
to
ammunition
for
her
in
this
war
when
she
Gets
going
she
dont
stop
when
Im
up
shes
like
a
downer
When
I
found
her
it
was
love
at
first
encounter
Plus
somehow
she
mustve
took
the
carton
of
eggs
off
the
counter
Cracked
them
and
placed
all
the
shells
on
the
ground
for
me
to
walk
on
when
Im
around
her
But
theres
just
something
bout
her
That
makes
me
not
able
to
function
without
her
How
can
I
get
out
of
it
when
I
dont
know
how
to
Im
a
doubter
Im
a
pessimist
Make
a
believer
out
of
me
And
show
me
the
way
now
Or
stay
the
fuck
out
of
my
cloud
of
rain
Cause
Im
going
straight
down
the
drain
Im
drowning
Its
like
Im
drowning
at
sea
Hoping
that
you
reach
for
me
I
know
youre
there
but
I
cant
see
Cause
Im
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
Im
dying
to
breathe
And
all
you
do
is
strangle
me
Such
a
beautiful
relief
Cause
Im
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
Drunk
off
tragic
endings
Now
Im
the
one
thing
You
couldnt
hate
more
But
youre
the
one
thing
That
I
would
die
for
It
took
a
while
for
me
to
get
it
but
I
think
Ive
figured
it
out
She
dont
want
me
she
just
dont
wanna
see
me
with
someone
else
The
idea
of
seeing
me
happy
destroys
her
in
itself
To
see
me
falling
to
pieces
brings
her
joy
brings
her
hell
But
it
annoys
her
to
see
me
get
this
straight
then
say
screw
her
I
threw
up
on
myself
Im
dumb
sick
Im
addicted
to
her
Shes
tryna
block
the
door
so
heres
how
I
do
her
Since
Im
manure
shes
a
sewer
This
time
this
piece
of
shits
running
through
her
I
can
see
that
right
now
Im
running
to
it
What
the
fuck
Shoulda
knew
it
Who
would
think
shed
actually
have
the
balls
to
do
it
As
soon
as
I
hopped
in
it
she
gassed
the
car
with
lighter
fluid
Shes
standing
there
with
a
rag
bout
to
put
the
lighter
to
it
Lit
the
fucking
thing
on
fire
then
she
threw
it
Its
like
Im
drowning
at
sea
Hoping
that
you
reach
for
me
I
know
youre
there
but
I
cant
see
Cause
Im
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
Im
dying
to
breathe
And
all
you
do
is
strangle
me
Such
a
beautiful
relief
Cause
Im
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
Drunk
off
tragic
endings
Feeling
kinky
lip
syncing
to
Too
$horts
Freaky
Tales
Biatch
Having
creepy
visions
of
whiskey
drinking
Envisioning
sneaking
into
where
Christie
Brinkley
dwells
I
know
this
is
risky
thinking
but
I
wanna
stick
her
like
she
decals
But
when
murdering
females
better
pay
attention
to
these
details
Or
you
could
be
derailed
better
wear
atleast
three
layers
Of
clothing
or
be
in
jail
If
you
get
scratched
because
your
DNAll
Be
all
up
under
her
fingernails
Man
he
hears
you
I
dont
think
he
cares
He
gives
a
fuck
even
his
pinky
swears
Three
personalities
burstin
out
of
me
please
beware
Her
TV
blares
cant
hear
the
creaking
stairs
Shes
all
aware
in
no
underwear
shes
completely
bare
Turns
around
and
screams
I
remember
distinctly
I
said
Im
here
to
do
sink
repairs
Chop
her
up
put
her
body
parts
in
front
of
Steven
Averys
trailer
And
leave
em
there
But
hey
man
I
was
framed
I
know
what
this
looks
like
officers
please
just
give
me
one
minute
I
think
I
can
explain
I
aint
murder
nobody
I
know
these
words
are
so
nutty
But
Im
just
here
to
entertain
How
come
your
shirt
is
so
bloody
Theres
a
missing
person
so
what
hes
got
nothing
to
do
with
me
Im
almost
certain
I
was
framed
Woke
up
it
was
dawn
must
a
knew
something
was
wrong
Think
Im
becoming
a
monster
cause
of
the
drugs
that
Im
on
Donald
Ducks
on
as
the
Tonka
Truck
in
the
yard
But
dog
how
the
fuck
is
Ivanka
Trump
in
the
trunk
of
my
car
Gotta
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
to
try
to
solve
it
Must
go
above
and
beyond
cause
its
incumbent
upon
Me
cause
I
feel
somewhat
responsible
for
the
dumb
little
blonde
girl
That
motherfuckin
baton
twirler
that
got
dumped
in
the
pond
Second
murder
with
no
recollection
of
it
Collecting
newspaper
articles
cutting
up
sections
from
it
Memories
to
fuck
to
remember
destructive
temper
cut
my
public
defenders
jugular
Then
stuck
him
up
in
the
blender
Another
dismembered
toddler
Discovered
this
winter
probably
Cause
the
disassembled
body
Was
covered
up
in
the
snow
since
the
month
of
November
oddly
Im
going
in
for
questioning
Them
son
of
a
bitches
probably
just
wanna
pin
this
on
me
But
hey
man
I
was
framed
I
know
what
this
looks
like
officers
please
just
give
me
one
minute
I
think
I
can
explain
I
murdered
nobody
I

these
words
are

But
Im

How

your
shirt
is
so
bloody
Theres
a
missing
person
so
what
hes
got
nothing
to
do
with
me
Im
almost
certain
I
was
framed
Still
on
the
loose
day
Spotted
me
inside
McDonalds
Tuesday
In
a
Toronto
Blue
Jays
cap
looking
like
your
college
roommate
With
Rihanna
Lupe
Saddam
Hussein
Bobby
Boucher
Or
was
it
Cool
J
the
cops
is
on
a
goose
chase
Just
escaped
from
the
state
pen
for
raping
eight
women
who
hate
men
Dont
make
it
no
weirder
Im
naked
when
I
break
in
your
basement
Under
your
babies
play
pen
I
lay
and
wait
adjacent
facing
the
door
remaining
patient
While
staying
complacent
blatant
Sexual
implications
are
continuing
to
get
thrown
Insinuations
are
placed
in
little
riddles
and
poems
Left
on
your
pillow
in
hopes
that
when
you
get
home
Youll
get
the
hint
ho
Im
in
your
window
But
it
never
occurred
to
me
I
could
describe
a
murder
scene
In
a
verse
and
be
charged
with
first
degree
Cause
it
just
happened
to
match
up
perfectly
With
the
massacre
or
the
Burger
King
burglary
No
officer
you
see
I
was
framed
I
know
what
this
looks
like
officers
please
just
give
me
one
minute
I
think
I
explain
I
murdered
nobody
I
know
these
words
are
so
nutty
But
Im
just
here
to
entertain
How
come
your
shirt
is
so
bloody
Theres
a
misssing
person
so
what
hes
got
nothing
to
do
with
me
Im
almost
certain
I
was
framed
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
worlds
on
fire
but
we
dont
care
yeah
Wasted
youth
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
were
never
getting
old
Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
youre
told
Were
going
nowhere
fast
I
feel
sorry
for
this
beat
Sympathy
pains
for
this
track
This
road
is
taking
me
back
Down
memory
lane
with
this
rap
I
can
still
look
out
in
this
crowd
Be
wowed
and
be
taken
aback
Im
simply
stating
a
fact
I
had
Wembley
Stadium
packed
But
now
were
on
a
path
headed
to
nowhere
and
fast
Another
terrorist
attack
like
a
tariff
grows
Half
of
Madison
Square
up
alas
We
perish
in
the
blast
but
that
doesnt
scare
us
We
pass
no
one
were
fearless
Cause
were
just
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
worlds
on
fire
but
we
dont
care
yeah
Wasted
youth
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
were
never
getting
old
Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
youre
told
Were
going
nowhere
fast
Cause
were
going
no
going
no
Going
no
going
no
Going
no
going
nowhere
Going
nowhere
fast
Fuck
doing
what
youre
told
act
like
a
two-year
old
Shit
is
soon
to
go
kaboom
and
blow
anyways
For
MCs
its
a
funeral
when
Im
devising
this
rhyme
Cause
Im
awake
and
youre
mourning
Thats
why
I
rise
and
I
shine
Like
a
new
day
has
dawned
on
me
Gusto
guts
bravado
nuts
and
plus
I
kick
up
dust
and
cuss
a
lot
I
musta
got
you
in
somewhat
of
a
debacle
Cause
some
stuff
thats
awful
really
dont
mean
nothing
all
though
Theres
a
lot
of
shit
I
said
in
jest
thats
tough
to
swallow
But
if
at
times
my
heart
it
seems
like
its
in
the
wrong
place
Its
probably
cause
its
on
my
sleeve
Keanu
Reeves
speed
of
life
Avoid
or
veer
or
just
steer
toward
it
Were
only
looking
forward
but
Where
were
going
we
have
no
idea
Nowhere
to
go
but
hysterical
Its
getting
warm
in
here
I
set
the
world
on
fire
Was
born
to
be
an
arsonist
Just
one
spark
and
its
lit
But
Ima
still
get
dark
on
this
shit
Told
you
Id
leave
my
mark
on
this
bitch
War
machine
but
youve
forced
me
in
a
corner
Im
sure
to
have
something
for
your
ear
And
in
the
course
of
the
assault
is
torture
its
more
severe
Go
to
war
with
me
or
end
up
blew
to
Timbuktu
I
send
at
you
a
ten
ton
nuke
like
Kim
Jong-Un
And
end
up
blewn
in
your
career
All
in
all
its
said
and
done
And
at
the
end
of
my
run
I
just
rewind
clocks
Forever
young
make
time
stop
Will
I
ever
fall
off
that
dayll
never
come
To
the
Pine
box
bitch
fuck
you
Im
better
than
I
ever
was
Til
the
bomb
drops
hope
it
never
does
but
Im
not
gonna
sweat
it
cause
this
Worlds
screwed
its
already
fucked
and
Im
on
top
So
everyones
just
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
worlds
on
fire
but
we
dont
care
yeah
Wasted
youth
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
were
never
getting
old
Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck

what
youre
told
Were
going
nowhere
fast
Cause
were
going
no
going
no
Going
no
going

Going

going
nowhere
Going
nowhere
fast
You
cant
tell
us
nothing
Hard-headed
and
were
stubborn
So
one
ear
and
out
the
other
were
young
Who
knows
what
the
future
for
us
could
hold
Another
shooter
uh
oh

more
tomorrows
were
done
And
all
we
are
is
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
worlds

fire
but
we
dont
care

Wasted
youth

Never

Going

Wanna
take
it
from
the
top
Lady
you
remind
me
of
my
raps
on
that
Relapse
shit
Cause
you
got
an
ass
thick
as
them
accents
Two
ass
cheek
implants
call
that
an
asset
Cause
you
could
set
a
glass
on
it
its
massive
From
the
first
time
I
saw
you
I
actually
said
to
myself
I
gotta
meet
her
like
a
taxi
Exactly
love
affair
in
the
backseat
Sorry
if
Im
being
graphic
but
Im
stiff
as
a
statue
You
sat
on
a
shelf
I
feel
like
Im
a
bust
Maybe
Im
just
ahead
of
myself
Let
me
slow
down
slow
your
Camaro
Im
tryna
catch
up
Im
tryna
jump
your
bones
to
the
marrow
Got
me
under
your
control
and
your
spell
Wanna
wrap
you
up
put
you
in
a
bow
like
an
arrow
Grab
you
by
the
meow
hope
its
not
a
problem
in
fact
About
the
only
thing
I
agree
on
with
Donald
is
that
So
when
I
put
this
palm
on
your
cat
Dont
snap
its
supposed
to
be
grabbed
Why
do
you
think
they
call
it
a
snatch
I
just
wanna
climb
in
the
sack
Ima
keep
it
100
like
my
speedometers

About
six

All

All

Hate

But

I

Checking

Pull

Shes

Shes

and
just
didnt
care
Who

least
that
isnt
up
in
the
air
Its
something

see
So

a
chick
who
thinks
her
coochie

If

Maybe

But

Lodged

Black

Motherfucking

a
shovel

mud
I

Cause

Dont

If

You

Come

Ricks

stream
From
your
persona
With
an
ass
to
match
girl
your
body

lit
Youre
striking
Im

Girl

just
gonna
have
to
put
the
mother
chumps
on
the
back
burner
You

puns
I
got
aspergers
Decided
to
rest
my
head
in
between
that
set
of
Ds
While
I
shred
MCs
like
cheddar
cheese
Thats
just
the
thoroughbred
in
me

better
breed
My
dog
thinks

look
at
my
pedigree
Ma
the
world

I
think

you
I
think
youre
divine
so
I
might
swing
on
you
Im
just

girl
I
wouldnt
lift
a
finger
or
two
Unless
its
the
middle
one
to
finger
you
All
day
all
day
all
night
You
ask
I
stay
the
night
With
you
you
say
youre
vile
Me
too
youre
burning
up
Im
running
Feel
feel
feel
feel
feel
my
heat
On
the
ones
and
twos
threes
and
four
in
the
morning
Ricks
in
the
cut
like
Neosporin
what
Hes
mixing

up
for

and
Lauren
A
teddy
like
short

Theodore
Were

Who

You

knocked
by

cops
Youll

Walk
in
the
arraignment
shoot
the
bailiff
Karate
kick
the
plaintiff
Gotti
with
the
stainless
Ill
just
call
it
shoddy
entertainment
If
yall
was
in
the
party
gettin
faded
On
molly
had
the
audience
sedated
You
wouldnt
catch
a
body
if
it
fainted
Probably
let
it
fall
and
hit
the
pavement
But
youd
be
the
first
lobbyin
to
claim
it
Bitch
stop
bein
a
lame
Your
hobby
isnt
robbery
and
dismemberin
body
limbs
Like
you
was
Tommy
Lynn
Sells
And
chainsawing
them
in
the
basement
Hardly
fits
your
job
description
Aint
nobody
dippin
out
the
back
of
the
club
like
Oh

God
hes
trippin
Only
time
you
get
the
blade
is
probably
with
the
dang
lawn
equipment
aint
it
Wouldnt
take
a
bobby
pin
and
wave
it
I
need
to
stop
bein
debated
Youre
still
copyin
Xeroxing
Im
still
coppin
a
feel
Like
Bill
Cosby
at
will
popping
a
pill
then
spill
Oxys
in
Jills
coffee
Then
send
her
out
to
the
hotel
lobby
a
lil
wobbly
and
still
groggy
This
blonde
fucks
reprehensible
misconducts
never
sensible
Kiss
my
butt
my
set
of
principles
is
gone
But
till
I
get
the
President
to
respond
My
pen
and
pencil
is
a
missile
launcher
And
send
it
to
Mitch
McConnell
Just

Like

Propofol
and
go
through
no
withdrawal
While
I
get
fellatio
and
give
a

Youre

Do

fake
dab
to
smell
my
armpits

Your
anxietys

But
I
made
strides
with
these
rape

Im

Like
Ray
Rice

FaceTimes
Bang

Dang
knives
to

gay
wives
Youre

sutures

As

into
captcha
Pull

like
sleigh
rides
Gotta
stab
a
bitch
at
least
eight
times
To
make
it
on
Dateline
I
came
to
stake
my
claim
like
a
canine
Waitin
in
a
buffet
line
So
Kellyanne
Conway
Im
a
really
bad
hombre
Come
play
belly
dance
on
me
Ive
been
making
wedding
plans
all

Cause
nobody

me
everybody
hates

They
want
me
to
go

some
worms
I
hope
you

And
drag
my
name
through
the
mud
through
the
dirt
But
Ima
make
you

your
words
I
hope

You

but
you

Cause
youre
only
gonna

I
hope

Cause

Til
everybody

my
turds
Eight
year
old
with
the
wordplay
Girl
take
this
pole
like
a
survey
Today
wasnt
my
birthday
But
Im
caked
up
like
a
dessert
tray
So
were
in
shape
Cause
youre
in
a
slurrin
state
Im
a
ten
youre
an
eight
like
what
I
do
before
after
and
during
rape
You
wanna
get
into
a
pissin
contest
and
find
out
whos
better
And
they
made
a
fool
out
of
what
I
pulled
out
him
R
Kelly
with
a
full
bladder
Not
in
high
school
grad
Im
not
a
scholar
But
Im
so
cold
that
Im
droppin
out
with
my
degrees
Its
the
same
as
I
got
in
college
Zero
But
nobodys
hotter
you
owe
me
my
respect
I
owe
you
nada
like
lodi
partner
that
blow
me
Told
you
Im
so
dirty
homie
you
can
throw
me
in
some
holy
water
With
some
floaties
on
And
get
the
soap
and
try
to
get
the
Pope
to
hold
me
While
you
hose
me
off
And
nope
I
wont
be
washed
You
hope
to
God
I
dont
explode
I
gotta
blow
this
spot
up
though
I
got
a
lotta
more
I
wont
put
the
sugar
coating
on
it
though
Cause
sometimes
you
can
feel
like
your
energys
expired
Raps
got
you
drained
dead
tired
zapped
You
feel
like
a
wet
pile
of
crap
But
look
man
like
the
feds
buggin
my
phone
uh
huh
I
get
why
youre
tapped
But
you
gotta
get
your
fire
back
Catch
fire
get
upset
and
fire
back
Is
what
I
tell
myself
When
times
get
bad
Cause
sometimes
I
might
get
sad
Well
I
take
the
same
advice
I
had
And
tell
myself
like
I
used
to
tell
Hailie
when
lifes
a
drag
Told
her
to
do
like
her
dad
dont
cry
get
mad
Cause
little
baby
powders
belong
in
diaper
bags
Im
hyper
by
the
time
you
see
this
side
of
me
Im
right
in
your
ass
Fore
the
pen
I
stood
up
for
the
kid
who
had
to
put
up
with
the
bullies
at
his
school
at
his
school
You
aint
have
to
have
no
money
or
go
shoppin
just
to
cop
a
fuckin
attitude
Now
my
doughs
amountin
to
a
mountain
its
rised
too
high
to
count
it
Never
asked
to
be
rich
all
I
did
was
wish
I
had
a
dime
for
every
time
that
I
was
doubted
But
then
I
think
about
it
and
Im
enraged
Cause
I
just
figured
out
that
if
I
was
paid
For
the
time
I
spent
to
put
the
pen
to
the
page
Itd
be
minimum
wage
But
its
embedded
in
my
head
and
I
never
hunted
for
the
bread
and
butter
What
I
wanted
was
to
be
the
one
that
they
was
scared
of
But
Im
never
gonna
get
the
credit
for
the
sweat
and
blood
I
put
up
in
the
pen
And
when
Im
dead
I
wonder
will
they
put
me
on
a
pedestal
Or
forget
I
was
ever
this
incredible
I
guess
I
better
go
harder
than
ever
cause
Ill
never
get
Another
mothafuckin
opportunity
again
To
offend
as
many
people
with
this
I
can
simply
because
I
can
Cause
nobody
likes
me
everybody
hates
me
They
want
me
to
go
eat
some
worms
I
hope
you
offended
And
drag
my
name
through
the
mud
through
the
dirt
But
Ima
make
you
eat
your
words
I
hope
you
offended
You
can
try
to
hold
me
down
but
you
better
let
me
up
Cause
youre
only
gonna
make
things
worse
I
hope
you
offended
Cause
I
swear
when
I
get
up
Im
never
gonna
let
up
Til
everybody
eats
my
turds
Youre
drunk
the
coffee
is
burned
I
hate
to
find
you
like
this
I
always
find
you
like
this
I
come
home
and
clean
up
your
mess
What
would
you
do
without
that
Why
do
I
always
come
back
Oh
what
I
wouldnt
do
for
you
And
Im
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
And
Im
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Some
nights
I
want
to
run
for
the
hills
Its
never
easy
with
you
I
cannot
reason
with
you
But
your
smile
is
as
rare
as
it
comes
What
would
I
do
without
that
Maybe
thats
why
I
come
back
Oh
what
I
wouldnt
do
for
you
And
Im
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
And
Im
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Starting
to
think
we
were
made
for
each
other
But
one
of
us
in
this
relationship
is
raising
the
other
You
remind
me
of
my
mother
We
drive
one
another
as
crazy
as
each
other
And
were
both
adults
so
theres
no
excuse
for
the
games
that
we
play
with
each
other
Where
you
at
At
a
friends
No
you
aint
motherfucker
But
I
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
Whenever
the
doubt
kicks
in
shiver
When
I
touch
her
cause
I
love
her
so
much
Im
a
sucker
Our
bottom
lip
can
quiver
when
shes
in
trouble
shes
in
hot
water
Think
I
caught
her
cheating
again
Give
her
another
chance
Another
one
after
that
Im
swimming
in
that
Egyptian
River
cause
Im
in
denial
Say
I
dont
eat
shit
but
I
got
a
shit-eating
grin
when
I
smile
Making
an
excuse
for
us
to
act
it
out
Shes
just
acting
out
with
her
inner
child
Then
I
set
the
truth
on
fire
Cause
Id
rather
believe
a
lie
then
breathe
a
sigh
of
relieve
that
I
dont
believe
in
Going
to
bed
mad
I
keep
on
trying
to
make
a
bad
girl
good
But
havent
I
stood
by
you
in
good
times
And
bad
Im
starting
to
feel
like
youre
god
damn
dead
Cause
I
literally
feel
like
you
could
die
of
a
should
I
Leave
me
for
good
You
never
would
Never
understood
why
they
call
it
goodbye
But
I
think
Im
a
pretty
damn
good
guy
And
youre
a
good
person
too
I
can
save
you
I
can
make
you
change
But
I
keep
putting
my
fuckin
foot
in
my
mouth
Every
time
I
gotta
come
to
bail
you
out
When
you
get
in
trouble
that
you
get
yourself
in
I
miss
trouble
but
I
cant
leave
Ill
sell
you
out
I
could
never
turn
my
fuckin
back
on
you
What
is
that
Im
co-dependant
Im
just
now
noticing
it
But
somehow
its
like
every
time
I
go
to
end
it
I
dont
have
the
cahoneys
to
do
it
Nor
the
heart
uh
department
store
Youre
using
my
heart
for
a
dart
board
But
God
mustve
had
a
non-stop
score
Cause
somebody
paired
us
up
But
people
say
he
aint
capable
of
making
a
mistake
But
this
ones
perfect
Cause
Im
And
Im
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
And
Im
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
In
your
head
in
your
head
Zombie
zombie
zombie-ie-ie
Whats
in
your
head

your
head
Zombie
zombie
zombie-ie-ie
oh
Im
backing
up
my
shit
Smoke
shit
in
the
cars
I
can
fit
and
Im
just
driving
as
far
as
I
can
get
Away
from
these
problems
to
all
my
sorrows
I
forget
Whats
tomorrow
like
Cause
tonight
Im
starting
life
again
Kids
in
the
corner
wont
stop
fucking
my
ignoring
Besides
psycho
when
I
fantasize
Starting
my
whole
life
over
yeah
right
Oh
and
I
might
go
and
Get
hypnotized
so
I
dont
even
recognize
no
one
I
try
to
look
alive
because
theres
nothing
like
Holding
your
head
up
high
when
youre
dead
inside
And
I
just
hide
so
in
case
youre
wondering
why
my
insides
showing
Cause
I
done
spilled
all
my
guts
and
know
some
minds
so
Im
Picking
them
up
and
stuff
them
in
the
back
Fuck
it
Ive
done
enough
in
this
rap
shit
Recovery>
brought
me
nothing
But
back
to
where
I
was
and
perhaps
this
couldve
been
my
victory
lap
if
I
wasnt
on
the
verge
of
Relapse
In
your
head
in
your
head
Zombie
zombie
zombie-ie-ie
Whats
in
your
head
in
your
head
Zombie
zombie
zombie-ie-ie
oh
It
seems
to
be
the
reoccurring
main
thing
The
shit
I
would
daydream
as
a
kid
I
was
eighteen
I
went
from
an
irate
teenager
to
still
raging
Is
it
though
amazing
back
then
I
put
eight
thing
Into
the
rhyme
whether
it
was
sad
mad
happy
or
angry
I
spit
it
the
mainstream
I
hit
it
Blame
me
I
did
itdid
whatHailie
Baby
I
didnt
mean
to
make
you
eighty
Percent
of
what
I
rapped
about
Maybe
I
shouldve
did
a
better
job
at
separating
Shady
and
entertaining
for
real
life
but
this
Dang
thing
is
still
the
hardest
thing
to
explain
Is
the
crazy
or
should
I
Ever
seen
it
back
then
it
was
like
I
aint
even
Bother
to
taken
into
consideration
You
and
[]
baby
and
older
and
make
hear
me
say
things
I
did
it
pay
me
and
be
it
just
aint
me
Okay
so
ladies
and
gentlemen
[]
berate
everything
Is
the
main
reason
that
I
feel
like
a
lame
piece
of
shit
Or
should
I
start
cranking
in
bitter
Come
playing
beef
and
pick
up
by
the
same
things
Cause
when
I
look
at
me
I
dont
see
what
they
see
I
feel
the
same
greedy
and
lately
Ive
been
contemplating
Escaping
to
get
a
ranger
or
whatever
this
road
takes
me
Its
making
me
crazy
whats
in
my
In
your
head

your
head
Zombie
zombie
zombie-ie-ie
Whats
in
your
head

Zombie

built
this
castle

Hailie
This
is
your
song
Youll
be
coming
out
of
mommys
stomach
soon
I
better
do
something
quick
if
Ima
be
able
to
support
you
I
can
barely
support
me
but
as
long
as
youre
healthy
Thats
all
that
matters
for
the
time
being
But
obviously
assuming
you
will
be
just
thinking
ahead
Ima
make
it
if
it
kills
me
Lets
see
how
far
I
can
take
it
with
this
music
Im
getting
sick
of
chasing
this
illusion
Sorry
for
sloppy
writing
The
pen
in
my
hands
shaking
please
excuse
me
Dads
a
little
nervous
but
at
the
same
time
excited
If
I
use
this
same
energy
while
Im
saying
rhymes
and
write
em
With
the
same
passion
and
the
same
exact
enthusiasm
As
Im
using
in
this
letter
maybe
they
can
feel
me
as
Im
Trying
to
build
these
castles
out
of
sand
baby
girl
For
you
to
sit
on
the
throne
I
got
plans
baby
girl
Welcome
to
mom
and
dads
crazy
world
Love
daddy
Maple
flavored
kisses
buttered
pancakes
and
syrup
I
built
this
castle
now
we
are
trapped
on
the
throne
Im
sorry
were
alone
I
wrote
my
chapter
Youll
turn
the
page
when
Im
gone
I
hope
youll
sing
along
This
is
your
song
I
just
want
you
to

dear
Hailie
You
got
your
mommas
personality
same
eyes
as
I
got
Her
beautiful
smile
but
your
ears
are
the
same
size
as
mine
are
Sorry
for
that
a
little
minor
mishap
But
youll
grow
into
em
baby
Im
on
the
grind
now
Im
doing
little
shows
open
mics
all-nighters
and
studios
While
Im
tryna
keep
the
lights
on
Why
does
it
seem
like
Im
so
close
to
this
dream
yet
so
far
I
just
keep
steering
Im
gonna
turn
into
someone
I
havent
the
slightest
clue
what
Im
gonna
do
if
it
falls
through
You
took
your
first
steps
today
youll
probably
walk
soon
My
Infinite
CD
flopped
too
many
soft
tunes
Theyre
talking
bad
about
dad
its
ticking
me
off
too
Makes
me
feel
like
I
dont
belong
or
something
ooh
I
think
I
might
have
just
stumbled
onto
something
new
Got
a
prediction
for
the
future
Im
hoping
its
you
Open
this
envelope
when
youre
older
and
it
holds
true
I
built
this
castle
now
we
are
trapped
on
the
throne
Im
sorry
were
alone
I
wrote
my
chapter
Youll
turn
the
page
when
Im
gone
I
hope
youll
sing
along
This
is
your

I
just
want

December
24th
2007
dear
Hailie
Now
if
you
found
these
letters
I
guess
I
better
try
to
explain
A
lots
happened
in
between
em
since
I
rised
to
this
fame
Ive
said
your
name
but
always
tried
to
hide
your
face
This
game
is
crazy
I
wanted
to
claim
my
love
for
you
but
damn
I
never
knew
itd
be
like
this
If
I
did
I
wouldnt
have
done
it
You
aint
asked
for
none
of
this
shit
Now
youre
being
punished
Things
that
shouldve
been
private
with
me
and
your
mother
is
public
I
cant
stomach
they
can
take
this
fame
back
I
dont
want
it
Ill
put
out
this
last
album
then
Im
done
with
it
One-hundred
percent
finished
Fed
up
with
it
Im
hanging
it
up
fuck
it
Excuse
the
cursing
baby
but
just
know
That
Im
a
good
person
though
they
portray
me
as
cold
And
if
things
should
worsen
dont
take
this
letter
I
wrote
as
a
goodbye
note
Cause
your
dads
at
the
end
of
his
rope
Im
sliding
down
a
slippery
slope
Anyways
sweetie
I
better
go
Im
getting
sleepy
Love
dad
Shit
I
dont
know
If
I
could
rewind
time
like
a
tape
inside
a
boombox
One
day
for
every
pill
or
percocet
that
I
ate
Cut
down
on
the
valium
thatll
hurt
everything
But
death
is
turning
so
definite
wait
They
got
me
all
hooked
up
to
some
machine
I
love
you
being
didnt
want
you
to
know
I
was
struggling
Feels
like
Im
underwater
submerged
like
a
submarine
Just
heard
that
nurse
say
my
liver
and
kidneys
arent
functioning
Been
flirtatious
with
death
skirt-chasing
I
guess
Its
arrivederci
same
nurse
just
heard
say
theyre
unplugging
me
And
its
your
birthday
Jade
Im
missing
your
birthday
Baby
girl
Im
sorry
I
fucking
hate
when
you
hurt
Hai
And
sweeties
thank
you
for
waiting
to
open
gifts
But
girls
you
can
just
open
em
dad
aint
making
it
home
for
Christmas
Wish
I
had
the
strength
to
just
blow
a
kiss
I
go
to
make
a
fist
but
I
cant
make
one
Im
frozen
stiff
I
yell
but
nothing
comes
out
Im
crying
inside
I
shout
My
vocal
cords
wont
permit
me
I
scream
but
its
not
allowed
You
put
your
arm
around
mama
the
karma
wow
I
just
thought
about
the
aisle
Ill
never
get
to
walk
us
down
Never
see
you
graduate
in
your
caps
and
gowns
Its
bout
to
be
2008
hows
this
happening
now
Ive
got
so
much
more
to
do
and
Proof
Im
truly
sorry
If
I
let
you
down
but
this
tore
me
in
two
The
thought
of
no
more
me
and
you
You
gave
me
shoes
Nikes
like
new
for
me
for
school
Doody
Im
trying
but
you
you
were
the
glue
that
binded
So
many
things
time
Id
give
anything
to
rewind
it
I
had
to
walk
down
my
halls
and
constantly
be
reminded
By
pictures
all
on
my
walls
and
I
couldnt
sleep
at
night
cause
That
image
burned
in
my
brain
of
you
on
the
table
Me
falling
across
your
body
not
able
to
stand
to
save
you
God
why
did
you
take
him
Im
tryna
keep
his
legacy
alive
but
Im
dying
wheres
Nathan
Little
ladies
be
brave
take
care
of
your
mother
Smile
pretty
for
pictures
always
cherish
each
other
Ill
always
love
ya
and
Ill
be
in
the
back
of
your
memory
And
I
know
youll
never
forget
me
just
dont
get
sad
when
remembering
And
little
bro
keep
making
me
proud
You
better
marry
that
girl
cause
shes
faithfully
down
And
when
youre
exchanging
those
sacred
vows
just
know
that
if
I
could
be
there
I
would
and
should
you
ever
see
parenthood
I
know
youll
be
good
at
it
Oh
almost
forgot
to
do
something
thank
my
father
too
I
actually
learnt
a
lot
from
you
you
taught
me
what
not
to
do
And
Mom
wish
Id
have
had
the
chance
To
have
one
last
heart-to-heart
honest
and
open
talk
to
you
Doody
I
see
you
I
go
to
walk
to
you
And
I
can
feel
my
soul
leave
my
body
and
float
across
the
room
Nurses
lean
over
the
bed
pulling
tubes
out
Then
the
sheet
over
my
head
shut
the
room
down
Girls
please
dont
get
upset
I
see
them
cheeks
soaking
and
wet
As
you
squeeze
hold
of
my
neck
so
forcibly
dont
wanna
let
Me
go
pillow
drenched
emotional
wrecks
With
every
second
each
closer
to
death
But
suddenly
I
feel
my
heart
begin
to
beat
slow
Then
a
breath
machines
go
beep
beep
beep
Mustve
guessed
the
cheat
codes
to
this
shit
Im
tryna
rewind
time
like
a
tape
find
an
escape
Make
a
beeline
try
and
awake
From
this
dream
I
need
to
re-find
My
inner
strength
to
remind
me
Even
if
a
steep
climb
I
must
take
To
rewrite
a
mistake
Im
rewinding
the
tape
I
dont
want
it
Ill
put
out
this
last
album
then
Im
done
with
it
One
hundred
percent
finished
fed
up
with
it
Im
hanging
it
up
fuck
it
Excuse
the
cursing
baby
but
just
know
That
Im
a
good
person
though
they
portray
me
as
cold
And
if
things
should
worsen
but
I
bet
you
they
wont
Im
pledging
to
throw
this
methadone
in
the
toilet
Shred
these
old
letters
I
wrote
All
that
old
pathetic
loathing
closing
credits
can
roll
Im
proud
to
be
back
Im
bout
to
like
a
rematch
Outdo
Relapse
With
Recovery
Mathers
LP2
Help
propel
me
to
victory
laps
Gas
toward
them
and
fast
forward
the
past
Consider
the
last
four
minutes
as
The
song
Id
have
sang
to
my
daughters
If
Id
have
made
it
to
the
hospital
Less
than
two
hours
later
but
I
fought
it
Came

a
boomerang

em
Now

new
day

Tuesday

Now
I
know
Yeah

like
I

punch
the
world
in
the
fuckin
face
right

Yeah

how
to
make
greatness
Straight

To

To

sub-par
bar

an
opinion
of
you
You
mention
me
millions
of
views
attention
in
news
I
mention
you
lose-lose
for
me
win-win
for
you
Billions
of
views
your
ten
cents

two
Skim
through
the
music
to
give
shit
reviews
To
get
clicks
but

fuse
Dont

Shit-list
renewed
so

do
Or

dissed
cause
I
just
dont

what
the

half
the
shit

that

t-to
Do

I

choppy
flow
Everyone

Probably

Get

fuckin
audio

Audi

Lil
Yachty
but

Not

All
I
am
simply
is
just
an
emcee
Maybe
Stan
just
isnt
your
cup
of
tea
Maybe
your
cups
full
of
syrup
and
lean
Maybe
I
need
to
stir
up
shit
Preferably
shake
the
world
up
if
it
were
up
to
me
Paul
wants
me
to
chill
yall

to
ill
I
should
eat
a
pill
probably
I
will
Old
me
kill
the
new
me
watch
him
bleed
to
death
I
breathe
on
the
mirror
I
dont
see
my
breath
Possibly
Im
dead
I
must
be
possessed
Like
an
evil
spell
Im
E-V-I-L
evil
but
spelled
Jam
a
Crest
Whitestrip
in
the
tip
of
my
dick
with
an
ice
pick
Stick
it
in
a
vice
grip
hang
it
on
a
spike
fence
Bang
it
with
a
pipe
wrench
While
I
take
my
ballsack
and
flick
it
like
a
light
switch
Like
vice-president
Mike
Pence
Back
up
on
my
shit
in
a
sidekick
as
I
lay
it
on
a
spike
strip
These
are
things
that
Id
rather
do
than
hear
you
on
a
mic
Since
nine-tenths
of
your
rhyme
is
about
ice
and
Jesus
Christ
man
how
many
times
is
someone
gonna
fuck
on
my
bitch
Fuck
my
side
chick
You
will
never
see
Em
icy
but
as
cold
as
I
get
on
the
M-I-C
I
polarize
shit
so
the
Thames
might
freeze
And
your
skull
might
split
like
I
bashed
you
upside
it
Bitch
I
got
the
club
on
smash
like
a
nightstick
yeah
Turn
down
for
what
I
aint
loud
enough
Nah
turn
the
valium
up
Cause
I
dont
know
how
Im
gonna
get
your
mouths
to
shut
Now
when
it
doesnt
matter
what
caliber
I
spit
at
Ill
bet
a
hundred
thousand
bucks
Youll
turn
around
and
just
be
like
Man
how
the
fuck
sourpuss
gonna
get
mad
just
cause
his
album
sucks
And
now
he
wants
to
take
it
out
on
us
ooh-ooh
But
last
week
an
ex-fan
mailed

copy
Of
The
Mathers
LP
to
tell
me
to
study
Itll
help
me
get
back
to
myself
and
shell

ooh-ooh
I
mailed
the
bitch
back
and
said
if
I
did
that
Id
just
be
like
everyone
else
in
the
fucking
industry
Especially
an
effing
Recovery
clone
of
me
So
finger-bang
chicken
wang
MGK
Iggy
‘zae
Lil
Pump
Lil
Xan
imitate
Lil
Wayne
I
should
aim
at
everybody
in
the
game
pick
a
name
Im
fed
up
with
being
humble
And
rumor
is
Im
hungry
Im
sure
you
heard
bumblings
I
heard
you
wanna
rumble
like
an
empty
stomach
I
heard
your
mumblin
but
its
jumbled
in
mumbo-jumbo
The
era
that
Im
from
will
pummel
you
Thats
what
its
comin
to
What
the
fuck
are
you
gonna
do
Where
you
runnin
to
Im
gonna
crumble
you
and
Ill
take
a
number
two
And
dump
on
you
if
you
aint
Joyner
If
you
aint
Kendrick
or
Cole
or
Sean
then
youre
a
goner
Im
bout
to
bring
it
to
anyone
in
this
bitch
who
want
it
I
guess
when
you
walk
into
BK
you
expect
a
Whopper
You
can
order
a
Quarter
Pounder
when
you
go
to
McDonalds
But
if
youre
lookin
to
get
a
porterhouse
you
better
go
get
Revival
But
yall
are
acting
like
I
tried
to
serve
you
up
a
slider
Maybe
the
vocals
should
have
been
auto-tuned
And
you
would
have
bought
it
But
sayin
I
no
longer
got
it
Cause
you
missed
the
line
and
never
caught
it
Cause
it
went
over
your
head
because
youre
too
stupid
to
get
it
Cause
youre
mentally
retarded
but
pretend
to
be
the
smartest
With
your
expertise
and
knowledge
but
youll
never
be
an
artist
And
Im
harder
on
myself
than
you
could
ever
be
regardless
What
Ill
never
be
is
flawless
all
Ill
ever
be
is
honest
Even
when
Im
gone
theyre
gonna
say
I
brought
it
Even
when
I
hit
my
forties
like
a
fuckin
alcoholic
With
a
bottle
full
of
malt
liquor
But
I
couldnt
bottle
this
shit
any
longer
The
fact
that
I
know
that
Ima
hit
my
bottom
If
I
dont
pull
myself
from
the
jaws
of
defeat
and
rise
to
my
feet
I
dont
see
why
yall
even
started
with
me
I
get
impeached
my
enemies
die
I
dont
ceasefire
til
at
least
all
are
deceased
Im
eastside
never
be
caught
slippin
Now
you
see
why
I
dont
sleep
Not
even
a
wink
I
dont
blink
I
dont
doze
off
I
dont
even
nod
to
the
beats
I
dont
even
close
my
fuckin
eyes
when
I
sneeze
Aw
man
That
BET
cypher
was
weak
it
was
garbage
The
Thing
aint
even
orange—oh
my
God
thats
a
reach
Shout
to
all
my
colorblind
people
each
and
every
one
of
yall
If
you
call
a
fire
engine
green
aquamarine
Or
you
think
water
is
pink
Dawg
thats
a
date
Looks
like
an
olive
to
me
Look
theres
an
apple
No
its
not
its
a
peach
So
finger-bang
Pootie
Tang
Burger
King
Gucci
Gang
dookie
dang
Charlamagne
gonna
hate
anyway
Doesnt
matter
what
I
say
Give
me
Donkey
of
the
Day
What
a
way
for
2018
to
get
underway
But
Im
gonna
say
everything
that
I
wanna
say
Welcome
to
the
slaughterhouse
bitch
yeah
Invite
them
in
like
a
One
A
Day
Im
not
done
preach
Cause
I
feel
like
the
beast
of
burden
That
line
in
the
sand
was
it
even
worth
it
Cause
the
way
I
see
people
turnin
Is
makin
it
seem
worthless
Its
startin
to
defeat
the
purpose
Im
watchin
my
fan
base
shrink
to
thirds
And
I
was
just
tryin
to
do
the
right
thing
but
word
Has
the
court
of
public
opinion
reached
a
verdict
Or
still
yet
to
be
determined
Cause
Im
determined
to
be
me
critique
the
worship
But
if
I
could
go
back
Id
at
least
reword
it
And
say
I
empathize
with
the
people
this
evil
serpent
Sold
the
dream
to
that
hes
deserted
But
I
think
its
workin
These
verses
are
makin
him
a
wee
bit
nervous
And
hes
too
scurred
to
answer
me
with
words
Cause
he
knows
that
he
will
lyrically
get
murdered
But
I
know
at
least
hes
heard
it
Cause
Agent
Orange
just
sent
the
Secret
Service
To
meet
in
person
to
see
if
I
really
think
of
hurtin
him
Or
ask
if
Im
linked
to
terrorists
I
said
Only
when
it
comes
to
ink
and
lyricists
But
my
beef
is
more
media
journalists
Hold
up
hold
up
hold
up…
I
said
my
beef
is
more
meaty
a
journalist
Can
get
a
mouthful
of
flesh
And
yes
I
mean
eating
a
penis
Cause
they
been
pannin
my
album
to
death
So
I
been
givin
the
media
fingers
Dont
wanna
turn
this
to
a
counselling
sesh
But
they
been
puttin
me
through
the
ringer
So
I
aint
ironin
shit
out
with
the
press
But
I
just
took
this
beat
to
the
cleaners
Motherfuckers
talkin
crazy
yeah
sayin’
I
should
quit
yeah
I
fuckin
tell
them
make
me
bitch
eat
a
fuckin
dick
yeah
I’m
feelin
like
the
greatest
woo
wanna
be
whoever
did
it
Mike
Will
the
one
who
made
it
its
Shady
on
the
lyrics
Im
somewhat
outlandish
they
say
You
say
were
cut
from
the
same
cloth
But
I
guess
you
fabricate
eh
You
better
bring
more
men
than
the
Latter
Day
Saints
Manic
states
Stephen
Paddock
with
automatic
stay
spray
At
anything
that
may
stand
in
their
way
As
I
stand
at
the
bay
window
with
a
hand
grenade
And
a
tre
eight
at
the
Mandalay
Bay
Common
sense
Im
a
dollar
short
and
a
day
late
James
Holmes
at
the
Saturday
Batman
matinee
Must
have
missed
my
cat-scan
that
day
I
just
threw
a
Tampax
at
Dre
Trashcan
Tascam
and
ashtray
Im
turning
back
to
a
madman

take
Anymore
but
I
try
to
get
away
from
the
anger
and
rage
My
basic
alias
is
an
A
to
the
K
Get
your
ass
spayed

breakin’
your
legs
Ain’t

the
ways

Even

how
to
do
somethin
To
give
goosebumps
a
day
when
you
say
That
somethin
you
wont
give
someone
a
lump
in
their
throat
If
you
had
them
choked
up
you’d
be
yankin
my
chain
Feelin
like
Im
headed
for
a
padded
cell
the
Bar
for
me
what
I
rap
isnt
fair
but
Guess
thats
the
standard
Im
held
to
But
if
somethin
like
that
doesnt
tell
ya
You
set
a
mark
too
high
when
platinum
sales
are
looked
at
as
a
failure
then
you
better
take
it
back
to
the
shelter
And
Hamburger
Helper

the—
Greatest
in
the
world

You

wrong
path
Nigga
wrong
way
the
wrong
road
Snakes
in
the
grass
tryna
slither
fast
I
just
bought
a
fuckin
lawn
mower
I
have
said
a
lotta
things
in
my
day
I
admit
it
This
is
payback
in
a
way
I
regret
it
that
I
did
it
I
done
won
a
couple
Grammys
but
I
sold
my
soul
to
get
em
Wasnt
in
it
for
the
trophies
just
the
fuckin
recognition
Fucks
the
difference
Im
that
cracker
bend
the
law
fuck
the
rules
Man
I
used
to
risk
it
all
now
I
got
too
much
to
lose
I
been
eatin
long
enough
man
my
stomach
should
be
full
I
just
ate
lick
the
plate
my
buffet
lucky
me
Fuck
you
think
woo
I
got
a
couple
of
mansions
Still
I
dont
have
any
manners
You
got
a
couple
of
ghost
writers
But
to
these
kids
it
dont
actually
matter
Theyre
askin
me
What
the
fuck
happened
to
hip-hop
I
said
I
dont
have
any
answers
Cause
I
took
an
L
when
I
dropped
my
last
album
It
hurt
me
like
hell
but
Im
back
on
these
rappers
And
actually
comin
from
humble
beginnings
Im
somewhat
uncomfortable
winning
I
wish
I
could
say
What
a
wonderful
feeling
Were
on
the
upswing
like
were
punchin
the
ceiling
But
nothin
is
stealing
like
anyone
has
any
fuckin
ability
To
even
stick
to
a
subject
its
killin
me
the
inability
to
pin
humility
Hatata
batata
why
dont
we
make
a
bunch
of
fuckin
Songs
about
nothin
and
mumble
And
fuck
it
Im
goin
for
the
jugular
Shit
is
a
circus
you
clowns
that
are
comin
up
Dont
give
an
ounce
of
a
motherfuck
About
the
ones
that
were
here
before
you
to
make
raps
its
recap
Way
back
MCs
that
recap
and
tape
decks
ADATs
with
the
G
raps
and
Kanes
hat
We
need
3
stacks
ASAP
and
bring
Masta
Ace
back
Because
half
of
these
rappers
have
brain
damage
All
the
lean
rappin
face
tats
syruped
out
like
tree
sap
I
dont
hate
trap
and
I
dont
wanna
seem
mad
But
in
fact
with
a
old-me
at
the
same
cat
that
would
take
that
Feedback
and
aim
back
I
need
that
But
I
think
its
inevitable
They
all
got
button
to
press
or
a
lever
to
pull
They
give
me
the
snap
though
lil
bitch
And
if
I
paid
attention
Id
probably
makin
it
big
But
youve
been
takin
the
dicks
in
the
fuckin
back
ho
get
it
On
the
brink
in
a
minute
Got
me
thinkin
of
finishin
everything
With
acetaminophen
then
reapin
the
benefits
Ima
sleep
at
the
wheel
again
As
I
peak
into
thinkin
about
an
evil
intent
Of
another
beat
em
and
kill
again
Cause
even
if
I
gotta
end
up
eatin
a
pill
again
Even
ketamine
or
methamphetamine
with
the
Manidon
It
better
be
at
least
70
to
300
milligram
And
I
might
as
well
cause
Ima
end
up
bein
a
villain
again
Levels

this
shit
I
got
an
elevator
You
could
never
say
to
me
Im
not
a
fuckin
record
breaker
I
sound
like
a
broken
record
every
time
I
break
a
record
Nobody
could
ever
take
away
the
legacy
I
made
a
navigator
Motherfucker
never
got
a
right
to
be
this
way
I
got
spite
inside
my
DNA
But
I
work
til
the
wheels
fall
off
Im
workin
tirelessly
ayy
Its
the
moment

waitin
for
Like
California
wishin
rain

pour
And
that
drought
yall
have
been
prayin
for
My
downfall
from
the
8
Mile
to
the
Southpaw
Still
the
same
Marshall

outlaw
That

But

Hey
whats
going
on
this
is
Paul
Rosenberg
attorney
of
law
Listen
I
listened
to
the
rough
copy
of
your
album
And
uh
you
know
Ive
just
got
to
be
honest
with
you
Can
you
tone
it
down
a
little
bit
Because
theres
only
so
much
I
can
explain
Give
me
a
call
Yo
how
do
I
keep
I
dont
know
what’s
up
with
these
hoes
man
Getting
in
relationships
like
this
Im
just
sayin
Maybe
it
says
something
about
me
Yeah
Should
I
look
in
the
mirror
I
just
want
you
to
be
normal
Why
can’t
you
bitches
be
normal
Always
gotta
be
so
extra
Why
you
always
need
a
lecture
My
ex
hates
to
talk
shes
a
texter
Even
when
Im
in
bed
layin
right
next
to
her
Wants
to
get
back
together
Said
not
til
she
gets
her
act
together
She
thinks
Im
bein
mean
and
now
She
starts
to
scream
and
shout
Shes
about
to
let
the
demons
out
She
don’t
want
to
see
me
with
other
females
out
I
tell
the
bitch
to
beat
it
take
the
scenic
route
She
retaliates
by
tryin’
to
leave
the
house
In
an
evening
gown
with
her
cleavage
out
Weve
been
down
this
road
too
many
times
for
me
to
count
And
all
I
can
think
is
how—
I
just
want
you
to
be
normal
Why
can’t
you
bitches
be
normal
Always
gotta
be
so
extra
Like
a
fuckin
terrestrial
Guess
it
comes
with
the
territory
My
ex
girl
she
just
declared
war
Therefore
I
better
prepare
for
it
I
guess
bein
weirds
normal
And
I
don’t
know
whats
got
a
hold
of
me
Most
notably
Ive
been
zonin
to
Jodeci
Im
totally
open
hopelessly
devoted
So
much
so
that
I
bet
you
she
dont
know
that
shes
The
first
thing
I
think
of
when
I
wake
up
And
the
last
thing
I
think
of
before
I
go
to
sleep
Sike
hope
she
dont
notice
me
goin
through
her
purse
I
know
she
cheats
so
do
I
Im
soulless
shes
heartless
No
wonder
were
partners
Both
got
hundreds
of
charges
Domestic
disputes
but
weve
always
Swept
it
under
the
carpet
Even
when
911
gets
the
call
that
I
slipped
up
and
busted
her
jaw
with
A
Louisville
Slugger
cause
alls
it
Really
does
is
make
our
love
For
each
other
grow
stronger
She
won
me
over
the
second
she
tried
to
run
me
over
Told
her
Id
keep
it
a
hun
We
all
but
kicked
her
out
called
her
back
now
shes
coming
over
But
why
is
she
so
wicked
And
how
the
fuck
did
I
get
so
twisted
Im
with
someone
thats
so
unlikeable
and
shifty
Were
like
nitrogen
and
hydrogen
mixed
with
Ignitable
liquids
but
Im
finally
seeing
Shes
only
mine
for
the
time
being
Thats
why
I
keep
bringin
up
that
one
time
she
Tried
to
two-time
me
And
throw
it
up
in
her
face
til
I
dry
heave
How
could
I
be
so
naive
Should
I
leave
or
turn
this
entire
evening
Into
a
motherfucking
crime
scene
Maybe
Im
just
too
ugly
to
compete
with
him
You
werent
supposed
to
agree
you
fucking
bitch
Especially
when
youre
the
one
cheated
first
Now
the
argument
immediately
becomes
heated
You
dont
want
me
to
flip
little
conceded
cunt
Eat
a
monkey
dick
wrapped
in
a
stuffed
pita
fajita
Slut
treat
just
like
a
drum
beat
it
Complete
it
and
once
youve
succeeded
repeat
it
I
love
you
but
I
hope
you
fuckin
die
though
In
our
business
your
friends
like
to
pry
so
Youve
got
em
all
under
cover
just
like
moles
Hopin
theyll
come
back
with
intel
But
Im
the
one
whos
thrown
into
the
spiral
Cause
now
the
roles
are
reversed
so
here
I
go
Thinkin
Im
sly
as
I
scroll
through
your
iPhone
Who
the
fucks
Milo
The
guy
at
work
who
drives
a
hi-lo
I
put
a
tracking
device
on
your
Chrysler
And
follow
you
while
you
drive
home
But
like
a
cyclone
I
just
got
my
disguise
blown
You
recognize
me
and
had
Milo
Flip
me
off
right
out
the
passenger
side
window
I
hit
a
light
pole
you
skirt
off
And
then
pull
up
at
5am
in
the
drive
in
a
stretch
white
limo
Stumble
in
the
side
door
and
hit
me
head
with
Milos
demo
But
like
a
drunk
bum
what
do
I
know
Lets
sleep
on
it
like
they
did
Revival
I
told
you
youre
the
apple
of
my
eye
so
shut
your
pie
hole
Just
wanna
be
normal
Why
cant
you
be
normal
Yeah
I
just
wanna
be
normal
Why
cant
you
be
normal
Eminem
-
Em
Calls
Paul
Skit
Encore
Aye
yo
Paul
Its
Em
I
got
your
call
about
the
Michael
Jackson
thing
And
I
know
that
hes
not
thrilled
about
the
video
What
does
he
wanna
be
startin
somethin
Well
Ill
show
him
whos
really
bad
Paul
the
way
you
make
me
feel
with
these
calls
You
should
really
take
a
look
at
the
man
in
the
mirror
And
tell
him
to
beat
it
because
I
wont
stop
till
I
get
enough
Do
you
remember
the
time
we
were
watching
the
Billy
Jean
video
Well
hell
always
be
that
Michael
to
me
And
it
doesnt
matter
if
hes
black
or
white
Because
I
cant
stop
loving
him
and
I
hate
plastic
surgeons
And
I
hope
they
all
fucking
die
How
do
you
like
that
And
I
like
him
I
like
him
a
lot
I
want
to
touch
him
but
I
cant
Excuse
me
Im
taking
a
shit
Sorry
Anyways
call
me
back
I
have
this
idea
about
how
I
want
to
end
the
show
So
hit
me
when
you
get
this
message
fucker
Oh
and
by
the
way
No
I
dont
have
a
new
gun
[click]
goddamn
it
Take
you
to
the
river
Yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
Its
2002
everything
was
totally
new
We
were
globally
huge
watchin
sales
go
through
the
roof
We
wrote
and
we
viewed
it
Runyon
Avenue
soldiers
included
A
multitude
of
homies
who
would
bounce
for
no
good
excuse
We
were
so
bulletproof—wrote
souped
and
soaked
in
our
youth
Thought
we
was
runnin
shit
til
we
lost
the
sole
of
our
shoe
The
death
of
Doody
broke
us
in
two
We
were
thrown
for
a
loop
aint
none
of
us
know
what
to
do
And
at
the
time
I
was
goin
through
my
own
struggles
too
So
I
wasnt
in
no
condition
to
be
coachin
us
through
Everyone
tried
to
go
solo
really
nobody
blew
I
was
hopin
they
do
so
I
aint
have
to
shoulder
the
crew
The
plan
was
put
everyone
in
position
so
that
they
knew
How
to
stand
on
they
own
and
I
dont
want
to
open
up
wounds
I
just
noticed
that
oomf
was
gone
when
we
go
in
the
booth
Cause
the
truth
is
the
moment
that
Proof
died
so
did
the
group
If
I
could
leave
this
world
behind
I
could
open
up
my
eyes
and
walk
in
a
straight
line
Turn
to
the
river
with
you
Help
me
leave
this
all
behind
Ima
wash
away
my
sins
Ima
rinse
away
this
dirt
I
forgot
to
make
amends
To
all
the
friends
I
may
have
hurt
I
better
stop
and
say
my
grace
From
that
I
pray
that
I
dont
fall
Cause
on
the
way
back
down
I
may
End
up
runnin
back
into
them
all
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
as
my
stepping
stones
It
was
never
the
same
and
its
bothered
me
since
And
the
farther
we
drift
apart
the
more
awkward
it
gets
The
more
time
goes
by
the
more
life
happens
And
we
gotta
be
men
we
got
responsibilities
Plus
we
dont
say
how
we
feel
And
I
feel
like
this
is
what
got
us
in
the
debacle
were
in
Been
with
you
guys
thick
and
thin
But
its
almost
as
if
sometimes
were
not
even
friends
Which
reminded
me
Biz
Rockstar
was
the
shit
Yall
coulda
got
you
a
hit
without
me
on
the
shit
If
you
woulda
put
D12
on
it
wish
I
coulda
did
More
than
try
talkin
you
into
comin
up
off
of
it
I
know
it
wasnt
my
fault
but
part
of
it
probably
is
I
think
of
all
of
the
trips
to
BET
And
the
rappers
I
wish
that
we
woulda
politicked
with
Maybe
yall
coulda
clicked
and
got
you
some
features
But
thats
water
under
the
bridge
But
Im
washin
my
sins
in
it
til
my
conscience
is
cleansed
If
I
could
leave
this
world
behind
I
could
open
up
my
eyes
and
walk
in
a
straight
line
Turn
to
the
river
with
you
Help
me
leave
this
all
behind
Ima
wash
away
my
sins
Ima
rinse
away
this
dirt
I
forgot
to
make
amends
To
all
the
friends
I
may
have
hurt
I
better
stop
and
say
my
grace
From
that
I
pray
that
I
dont
fall
Cause
on
the
way
back
down
I
may
End
up
runnin
back
into
them
all
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
as
my
stepping
stones
Bacardi
and
Hen
never
thought
the
party
would
end
One
minute
youre
bodyin
shit
but
then
your
audience
splits
You
can
already
sense
the
climate
is
startin
to
shift
To
these
kids
you
no
longer
exist
Went
from
rainin
cats
and
dogs
in
this
bitch
To
tiny
drops
little
drips
And
by
the
time
your
reign
is
over
youll
hardly
be
missed
You
start
thinkin
of
all
the
artists
you
gift
all
the
carnage
you
left
Is
this
the
kind
of
karma
you
get
For
turnin
your
fuckin
back
on
Bizzy
Kuniva
and
Swift
A
Freudian
slip
subconsciously
I
honestly
wished
I
aint
feel
so
much
guilt
and
yall
didnt
harbor
resentment
But
its
hard
to
pretend
that
yall
aint
got
none
I
just
wish
I
had
words
But
I
guess
theyre
just
are
none
for
this
To
my
partners
I
cant
say
how
sorry
I
am
This
is
not
how
I
planned
for
our
story
to
end
I
love
all
of
you
man
But
I
just
cant
be
the
guy
everybody
depends
On
for
entire
careers
cause
thats
not
even
fair
I
will
always
be
here
but
that
spark
isnt
there
And
I
dont
know
how
to
recapture
that
time
and
that
era
Ive
tried
hearkening
back
to
but
Im
fightin
for
air
Im
barely
chartin
myself
Feels
like
Im
on
the
descent
but
it
was
not
my
intent
To
treat
yall
like
a
stepping
stone
Though
I
aint
left
no
one
behind
but
we
been
down
every
road
Done
all
we
possibly
can
I
know
we
kept
our
hopes
up
But
the
longer
we
spend
livin
this
lie
that
we
live
The
less
is
left
for
closure
so
lets
let
this
go
Its
not
goodbye
to
our
friendship
but
D12
is
over
Ima
wash
away
my
sins
Ima
rinse
away
this
dirt
I
forgot
to
make
amends
To
all
the
friends
I
may
have
hurt
I
better
stop
and
say
my
grace
From
that
I
pray
that
I
dont
fall
Cause
on
the
way
back
down
I
may
End
up
runnin
back
into
them
all
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
as
my
stepping
stones
I
never
meant
to
make
you
feel
like
my
stepping
stones
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
for
my
stepping
stones

Look

I

Shade

that
shit

embarrassing
There

no

we

that
shit
again
I
guarantee
That
way
that
shit
was
so
ass
its
somethin
we
wouldnt
dare
re-air
The
shits
embarrassing
as
me
rear-ending
Tara
Reid

In
my
therapy
chair
my

of

Each

width
of
an
acorn
stairlift
beware
of
me
Lyrically
Im

your
lyrics
prepared
Richard

Wait

Somethin

Im

conspiracy
theorist
But
somethin
here

Wait

Ive

And
Ive

respects
Cause
if
you

youre
fucked:
other
words

get
laid
to
rest
And
I
hope
your
butt
is
hurt
Put
me
on
a
track
I
go
cray
on
it
like
a
color
book
You
got
some
views
but
youre
still
below
me
Mine
are
higher
so
when
you
compare
our
views
you
get
overlooked
And
I
dont
say
the
hook
unless
I
wrote
the
hook
And
now
Im
just
freestylin
in
the
vocal
booth
And
you
know
Ive
always
spoke
the
truth
You
lyin
through
your
teeth
so
much
you
broke
a
tooth
And
it
aint
somethin
I
need
a
phone
to
do
When
I
say
I
cant
wait
til
I
get
ahold
of
you
And
I
dont
know
what
Im
sposed
to
do
Line
up
the
rappers
take
my
pic
like
a
photo
shoot
You
know
everybodys
been
tellin
me
what
they
think
about
me
for
the
last
few
months
Its
too
loud
Maybe
its
time
I
tell
em
what
I
think
about
them
Cant
hear
it
coming
down
the
hallway
stairs
from
the
parking
lot
Its
too
loud
Freeze
my
crown
all
up
in
it
Slow
fire
Dont
fall
on
my
face
Dont
fall
on
my
faith
oh
Dont
fall
on
my
fate
Dont
fall
on
my
faith
oh
Dont
fall
on
my
fate
Dont
fall
on
my
Gotta
concentrate
against
the
clock
I
race
Got
no
time
to
waste
Im
already
late
I
got
a
marathoners
pace
Went
from
addict
to
a
workaholic
word
to
Dr
Dre
in
that
first
marijuana
tape
Guess
I
got
a
chronic
case
And
I
aint
just
blowin
smoke
less
its
in
your
mamas
face
I
know
this
time
Paul
and
Dre
they
wont
tell
me
what
not
to
say
And
though
me
and
my
party
days
have
all
pretty
much
parted
ways
Youd
swear
to
God
Ive
forgot
Im
the
guy
that
made
Not
Afraid
One
last
time
for
Charlemagne
If
my
response
is
late
its
just
how
long
it
takes
To
hit
my
fuckin
radar
Im
so
far
away
These
rappers
are
like
Hunger
Games
One
minute
theyre
mocking
Jay
Next
minute
they
get
they
style
from
Migos
then
they
copy
Drake
Maybe
I
just
dont
know
when
to
turn
around
and
walk
away
But
all
the
hate
I
call
it
Walk
on
Water
gate
Ive
had
as
much
as
I
can
tolerate
Im
sick
and
tired
of
waitin
I
done
lost
my
patience
I
can
take
all
of
you
motherfuckers
on
at
once
You
want
it
Shady
You
got
it
Dont
fall
on
my
face
Yeah
Dont
fall
on
my
faith
oh
Dont
fall
on
my
fate
Light

up
Dont
fall
on
my
faith
oh
Rrr
Dont
fall
on
my
fate
Look
Somebody
tell
Budden
before
I
snap
he
better
fasten
it
Or
have
his
body
baggage
zipped
The
closest
thing
hes
had
to
hits
is
smacking
bitches
And
dont
make
me
have
to
give
it
back
to
Akademiks
Say
this
shit
is
trash
again
Ill
have
you
twisted
like
you
had
it
when
you
thought
you
had
me
slippin
at
the
telly
Even
when
Im
gettin
brain
youll
never
catch
me
with
a
thot
Lacking
with
it
he
aint
spit
like
this
in
his
last
shit
Hoe
you
better
go
back
and
listen
You
know
me
better
thinkin
Ill
slow
up
let
up
Call
it
traps
cause
its
a
total
setup
Hopin
that
you
rappers
fall
in
that
Dre
said
Hold
your
head
up
Kathy
Griffin
stackin
ammunition
slap
the
clip
and
cock
it
back
on
competition
this
is
how
I
shot
a
head
pew
Gabby
Giffords
my
attack
is
viscous
jack
the
ripper
back
in
business
Tyler
create
nothing
I
see
why
you
called
yourself
a
faggot
bitch
Its
not
just
cause
you
lack
attention
Its
cause
you
worship
D12s
balls
youre
sacrilegious
If
youre
gonna
critique
me
you
better
at
least
be
as
good
or
better
Get
Earl
the
Hooded
Sweater
whatever
his
name
is
to
help
you
put
together
some
words
more
than
two
letters
The
fans
waited
for
this
moment
Like
the
feature
when
I
stole
this
show
Sorry
if
I
took
forever
Dont
fall
on
my
face
Yeah
Dont
fall
on
my
faith
oh
I
wont
Dont
fall
on
my
fate
Light
him
up
Dont
fall
on
my
faith
oh
Ha
Dont
fall
on
my
fate
Its
too
easy
Just
remember–I
was
here
before
you
And
Ill
be
here
after
you
make
your
run-in
for
you
Detract
this
I
might
have
to
fuck
Pitchfork
with
a
corkscrew
Just
what
the
doctor
ordered
Revenge
is
the
best
medicine
Increase
the
dose
unleash
the
monster
Then
tell
the
Grammys
to
go
and
fuck
themselves
they
suck
the
blood
from
all
the
biggest
artists
like
some
leeches
So
they
nominate
em
get
em
there
get
a
name
to
em
See
the
show
every
parasite
needs
a
host
Then
give
Album
of
the
Year
to
somebody
that
no
ones
ever
even
heard
of
All
I
know
is
I
wrote
every
single
word
of
everything
I
ever
murdered
Time
to
separate
the
sheep
from
goats
And
I
got
no
faith
in
your
writers
I
dont
believe
in
ghosts
When
rap
needed
it
most
I
was
that
wing
in
the
prayer
A
beacon
of
hope
the
B-I-R-D
in
the
air
Somewhere
some
kid
is
bumping
this
while
he
lip-syncs
in
the
mirror
Thats
who
Im
doin
it
for
the
rest
I
dont
really
even
care
But
you
would
think
Im
carryin
a
Oxford
dictionary
in
my
pocket
how
Im
buryin
these
artists
On
the
scale
it
turns
to
minus
Mines
is
various
as
hardly
and
whats
scary
is
you
prolly
can
compare
me
to
your
car
cause
Im
barely
gettin
started
And
as
far
as
Lord
Jamar
you
better
leave
me
the
hell
alone
Or
Ill
show
you
an
Elvis
clone
Walk
up
in
this
house

Brush
my
pelvic
bone
You

tell
a

Put

hope
That

together
a
severed
earlobe
Mailed
to
you

E-N-V-E
lope
Would

What

of
lengths

Pull

Righteous
Teachers

Where

Like

six
thousand
times

I
was
a
kid
As

child
picked
on
clowned
Countless
times
Ive
been
outed
Gotta
remind
myself
of
it
every
now
and
then
Yeah
So
the
route
I
wents
self-empowerment
In
a
hole
taught
myself
how
to
get
out
of
it
And
balance
it
with
talents
wit
Cause
life
is
like
a
penny
Life
is
like
a
penny
Cause
its
only
one
percent
Who
overcome
the
shit
theyve
underwent
I
went
AWOL
like
what
my
back
was
up
against
Dont
tell
me
bout
struggle
bitch
I
lived
it
I
was
five
or
six
the
first
time
I
got
my
hind
end
kicked
Malcolm
Isaac
and
Boogie
jumped
me
and
took
my
tricycle
And
I
dont
know
if
I
would
call
that
white
privilege
yeah
But
I
get
it
how
it
feels
to
be
judged
by
pigment
Besides
getting
it
from
both
sides
of
the
tracks
But
I
swore
Id
get
them
back
Even
if
it
meant
selling
my
soul
to
get
revenge
and
What
Thought
of
a
scheme
and
it
got
me
to
thinking
If
I
can
believe
in
myself
I
could
prolly
achieve
it
That’s
part
of
the
reason
I
do
all
my
talking
when
He
can
And
as
long
as
Im
breathing
I
vow
to
smother
and
beat
them
Got
a
heart
of
a
demon
go
at
em
and
Ima
get
even
Like
Im
in
the
Garden
of
Eden
Im
bout
to
go
off
of
the
deep
end

The

verb
Ho

men
and
who
traps

attack
similar
to
an
actual
arachnid
Or
a
vaginal
tarantula
or
black
widow
In

itll
be
nothing
to
throw
that
lil
Bitch

a
capital
B

the
back
window
out
the
black
Cadillac
limo

Reynolds
Apparently

not
at
my
side
I
shake
in
convulsions
separation
anxiety
cause
we
may
be
the
closest
Yeah
baby
we
hopeless
dont
we
make
an
atrocious
Combination
We
know
its
like
playin
with
explosives
Quite
dangerous
though
but
my
brains
in
hypnosis
Such
a
wide
range
of
emotions
Migraines
but
why
the
fuck
am
I
takin
these
MOTRINs
Ibuprofens
like
a
drop
of
rain
in
the
ocean
And
youre
my
fix
on
the
days
when
Im
broken
But
the
shits
about
to
go
sideways
I
just
know
it
Ill
never
love

The
way
I
loved
you
Did
you
find
someone
new
Are

this
with
them
Cause
I

when
Still

when
you

inseparable
at
one
time
yeah
You
know
my
love
for
you
was
undying
yeah
You
used
to
always
have
my
back
So
I
spiral
downwardly
cause
Im
too
cowardly
to
leave
you
Head
is
clouded
in
a
fallacy
but
in
reality
Somehow
it
seems
like
when
I
lay
me
down
to
sleep
Im
counting
sheep
Youre
bound
to
creak
Cause
every
time
I
turn
around

runnin
out
on

Youre

Xanax
and

valium
Im
an
addict

a
downer
Youre
my
habit

like
I
found
you
in
the
cabinet
But
its
like
I
cant
uncap
it
cause
its
childproof
A
scoundrel
and
fiends
how
I
feel
around
you
Awful
every
time
I
lost
you

like
I
had
you
in
my
pocket
Now

flippin
over
the
furniture
punchin
holes
in
the
walls
through
Everything
that
weve
gone
through
How
many
times
youve
fucked
me
But
the
way
it
felt
for
me
to
be
on
top
when
I
was
on
you
Swore
my
fealty
but
word
to
GOD
I
thought
you

just
like
Im
so
lost
just
like
Im
so
lost
Yeah
All
the
hate
cant
tell
exactly
where
it
stems
from
But
its
happening
again
huh
Yall
used
to
be
in
my
corner
Now
you

backed
me
in
one
Innocent
bystanders
Im
bound
to

For
some
adversaries
I
carry
big
guns
So
some
targetsll
get
the
kill
shot
Some
I
just
barely
nicked
em
I
can
make
a
mistake
and
erupt
and
end
up
takin
a
dump
Or
sayin
some
dumb
shit
thinkin
I
run
shit
Misplacin
my
anger
enough
to
give
Earl
and
Tyler
The
Creator
the
brunt
Shoulda
never
made
a
response
to
the
disdain
for
the
fake
ones
Them
traitorous
punks
cause
snakes
are
just
cunts
They
can
get
fucked
with
eight
hundred
motherfuckin
vibrators
at
once
And
for
any
of
those
who
may
have
come
close
to
about
dyin
And
cant
listen
to
Arose
without
cryin
For

Weapon

unholstered
without
firin
My

imposin
foes

like
theyre

the
throes
of
a
mountain
lion
They
talk
about
my
daughters
hopin
I
fly
off
of
the
handle
Cause
my
first
thought
is
to
trample
and
write
a
thousand
bars
But
sometimes
its
like
dropping
an
anvil
on
a
house
of
cards
Or
Godzilla
squashin
a
crouton
with
combat
boots
on
Or
droppin
a

John

And

boom
mic
Why

you
irrelevant
fucks
want
to
rebel
against

Knowing
your
Smith

Wesson

never
been
clutched
Knowing
you

rushed
by
the

ignorant

The

Your

Like
Eminem-Dr
with

guilty
conscience
Im
still
shockin
like
droppin

boombox
in
bathwater
More
shockin
than

Blanka
I
just
finished
fuckin
a
fish
called
Wanda
Im
finna
wander
off
into
yonder
Beyond
just
mentally

I

You

cross
of
a
unicorn
and
The
Unabomber
Quit

like

golfers
I
put
a
hole
in
one
of
you
birdies
with
this
Eagle
and
launch
it
Pew
I
thought
I
heard
a
voice
in
my
head
that
said
Kill
I
had
no
other
choice
that
was
left
except
fill
My
pencil
full
of
poisonous
lead
the
devil
He
wants
me
to

so
I

He
told
me
there
are

who

They

I

The

They
want
the

on
my
head
I
said
Chill
If
you
want
me
to
murder
this
beat
then
I
will
Now
this
will
probably
be
the
most
illest
shit
that
Ive
ever
said
God
bless
the
dead
and
let
Biggie
possess
the
pencil
lead
They
called
me
a
sped
and
said
that
I
had
a
messed
up
head
Cause
I
said
motherfuck
school
and
instead
went
to
special
ed
Sippin
Bacardi
and
lime
I
start
to
recollect
on
the
time
That
I
startled
my
mom
and
had
her
scared
to
death
Word
to
Method
Man
She
heard
some
Wu-Tang
coming
from
towards
the
patio
She
was
like
What
the
heck
was
that
She
went
to
check
on
the
noise
and
go
inspect
the
deck
Then
I
jumped
out
with
a
sword
and
yelled
Protect
your
neck
Now
bow
to
the
Lord
hold
up
no
better
yet
kneel
Better
yet
get
down
on
all
fours
and
take
a
vow
to
always
Rejoice
in
the
sound
of
my
voice
bitch
you
dont
have
a
choice
Just
a
third
of
my
will
will
overpower
yours
Using
about
a
fourth
to
create
the
amount
of
force
Itll
take
to
knock
out
a
horse
like
a
tranq
full
of
Tylen—
or
Enter
my
house
of
whores
with
a
thousand
floors
Got
a
crown
of
thorns
but
it
wont
fit
around
the
horns
But
Ima
keep
it
a
buck
like
a
dollar
store
Im
more
than
you
bargained
for
and
I
am
far
more
worse
Than
a
fourty-some
bar
Lord
Jamar
verse
Nothing
means
more
than
respect
so
when
I
curse
You
could
say
I
swore
to
protect
My
image
I
have
zero
time
or
regard
for
I
never
was
been
claiming
rap
when
its
not
yours
If
it
was
anyones
house
G
Rap
and
Rakim
would
be
havin
you
mop
floors
Run-DMC
would
be
havin
you
cleanin
sinks
Yeah
your
group
was
off
the
chain
but
you
were
the
weakest
link
Rest
of
these
youngins
of
mine
Time
to
start
throwing
some
shade
this
time
Im
shutting
the
blinds
Cause
when
Im
looking
at
yall
shit
its
no
wonder
its
why
I
need
a
visor
cause
yall
are
just
suns
in
my
eyes
Born
a
cynic
and
more
demented
than
an
orphanage
with
a
morgue
up
in
it
Next
door
to
an
abortion
clinic
Newborn
infants
tortured
and
tormented
With
their
foreheads
dented
when
they
drop
cause
the
floors
cemented
Their
corpses
get
ornamented
The
corner
where
the
store
has
been
rented
To
store
them
in
and
the
torsos
of
forty
women
reported
missin
Distorted
twisted
this
isnt
no
storybook
ending
This
is
only
the
beginning
So
Lord
forgive
me
Im
hearing
voices
I
cant
ignore
them
anymore
theyre
winning
I
thought
I
heard
a
voice
in
my
head
that
said
Kill
I
had
no
other
choice
that
was
left
except
fill
My
pencil
full
of
poisonous
lead
the
devil
He
wants
me
to
murder
this
beat
so
I
will
He
told
me
there
are
doubters
who
question
my
skill
They
wanna
put
my
style
to
the
test
am
I
still
The
best
They
want
the
crown
on
my
head
I
said
Chill
If
you
want
me
to
murder
this
beat
then
I
will
And
I
dont
think
that
I
can
stop
it
Here
it
comes
I
do
my
best
to
try
to
block
it
Redrum
Ive
been
sipping
on
like
vodka
Heads
numb
Im
blacking
out
you

it
Its
bedlam
Black
magic
night
walker
Yeah
She
haunts
me

other
Feel
like
Nobody

I
dont
know

Black
magic
dark
water
But
its
like
Surrounds
me
like
no
other
Its
like
I
know
you
better
than
anyone
Shes
got
my
heart
in
chains
Were
volatile
I
cant
call
it
though
Its
like
too
large
a
peg
and
too
small
a
hole
Yeah
But
she
cheats
and
I
catch
her
like
the
common
cold
Sneeze
Last
time
I
broke
her
collar
bone
shes
intolerable
Yeah
All
I
know
is
that
the
sex
is
phenomenal
though
Were
an
unlikely
pair
Yeah
Like
two
different
Nike
Airs
But
Im
the
same
size
she
wears
Jordans
So
I
think
were
soulmates
though
Yeah
People
dont
like
us
together
but
like
we
care
Not
me
not
me
Yeah
but
God
strikes
me
dead
Yeah
She
knows
that
I
would
walk
over
hot
coals
for
her
with
both
of
my
feet
bare
Yeah
As
soon
as
I
asked
to
hit
Asked
to
hit
its
like
she
grabs
a
switch
Grabs
a
switch
Turns
me
over
her
knee
as
my
ass
is
whipped
Yeah
and
I
got
her
back
but
Im
spineless
Yeah
So
when
she
stabs
me
in
mine
Yeah
its
like
I
just
cant
feel
the
nitrous
What
She
pokes
stabs
and
then
slices
One
minute
shell
build
me
up
Up
The
next
shell
push
me
round
Probably
watchin
calls
me
Dumbbell
She
lifts
me
up
Yeah
then
puts
me
down
Huh
But
I
am
under
her
thumbnail
I
must
be
under
her
spell
Its
like
lookin
right
into
a
gun
barrel
But
none
of
these
hoes
can
fuck
with
my
girl
She
got
that
Black
magic
night
walker
She
haunts
me
like
no
other
Nobody
told
me
love
is
pain
oh
Black
magic
dark
water
Surrounds
me
like
no
other
Shes
got
my
heart
in
chains
We
wake
up
break
up
make
up
Like
Maybelline
now
shes
all
made
up
like
make
believe
Probably
why
shes
so
fake
to
me
But
what
the
fucks
it
gonna
take
for
me
to
make
her
see
Strip
her
naked
and
take
her
keys
I
been
plannin
this
thing
for
weeks
but
I
cant
tell
if
Im

But
if
this
is
actually
happenin
sucker
for
pain
Im
stuck
in
this
radioactive
pattern
But
hurt
by
her
motherfuckin
hairs
All
I
imagine
dragon
She
lunges
attacks
and
scratches
But
I
aint
gonna
stand
for
that
shit
Like
Kaep
for
the
National
Anthem
As
I
stab
em
laughin
So
much
for
witchcraft
and
magic
Abracadabra
that
bitch
No

Im
blackin
As
I
say
farewell
to
love
of
my
life
I
cut
and
I
slice
I
give
her
one
last
hug
goodbye
Wipe
the
blood
off
my
butterfly
knife
Watch
her
fuckin
die
right
in
front
of
my
eyes
But
in
hindsight
think
I
just
wanted
to
see
what
her
insides
look
like
As
I
pop
another
five
Vics
Thats
what
this
highs
like
Look
down
theres
blood
on
my
knife
Shovel
at
my
side
blood
on
my
mic
Now
wake
up
to
music
to
be
murdered
by
Like
Before
I
check
the
mic
Check
check
one
two
I
give
it
an
extra
swipe
with
a
Lysol
disinfectant
wipe
Good
evening
Coronavirus
in
effect
tonight
Antiseptics
on
deck
I
got
every
type
Yeah
I
throw
on
my
tux
then
I
Yeah
give
zero
fucks
then
I
Yeah
Act
like
a
jockstrap
Uh
cup
my
nuts
then
I
Yeah
Check
my
ball
hair
What
make
sure
its
all
there
Yeah
Then
call
the
pallbearer
Yeah
Its
Music
to
Be
Murdered
By
again
why
stop
Overkill
like
a
pipe
bomb
in
your
pine
box
Youre
all
hitched
to
my
cock
What
Went
from
punchin
a
time
clock
to
getting
my
shot
Then
treated
it
like
a
cyclops
Like
its
the
only
one
I
got
And
my
thoughts
are
like
nines
cocked
Chk-chk
Every
lines
obscene
pervertedest
mind
got
the
dirtiest
rhyme
stocked
Thats
why
theres
parental
advising
every
time
I
drop
So
throw
on
the
theme
to
Alfred
Ill
channel
him
like
the
Panama
Canal
But
how
could
I
get
up
in
arms
about
you
saying
trash
is
all
that
I
put
out
Bitch
I
still
get
the
bag
when
Im
putting
garbage
out
Plus
the
potty
mouth
Im
not
about
to
wash
it
out
The
filthiest
so
all
this
talk
about
Im
washed
up
how
preposterous
Because
if
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
Its
obvious
that
its
impossible
for
me
to
be
beside
myself
And
Im
bout
that
capital
like
a
proper
noun
Still
on
top
the
pile
Got
me
sitting
on
numbers
like
a
pocket
dial
Quick
to
call
you
out
on
your
bullshit
Dont
make
me
give
that
crock
a
dial
Cause
if
I
do
its
see
you
later
alligator
Made
it
out
the
trailer
then
I
made
a
vow
to
cater
to
no
one
So
hate
Ive
gained
about
the
same
amount
thats
in
my
bank
account
So
heres
some
more
shit
for
you
to
complain
about
I
say
the
Bars
that
never
slack
but
always
get
attacked
Yeah
I
think
theyre
gunnin
for
me
its
startin
to
feel
like
that
Like
Im
marked
cause
when
I
rap
its
like
fallin
on
my
back
in
a
tar
pit
Cause
I
have
this
target
on
my
back
Ew
yuck
But
if
I
ever
double-crossed
my
fans
and
lost
my
Stans
Id
probably
pop
five
Xans
Yeah
Go
in
my
garage
start
my
van
Inhale
as
much
carbon
monoxide
and
exhaust
I
can
And
doze
off
like
snores
but
odds
like
that
with
these
thoughts
I
haves
Like
a
giant
getting
squashed
by
ants
If
this
is
the
test
of
time
Id
pass
with
flying
colors
Like
I
just
tossed
my
crayons
Tossed
my
crayons
Small
medium
and
large
size
cans
Sanitizers
of
all
types
brands
cost
nine
bands
Which
is
a
small
price
for
Lysol
wipes
and
If
my
palms
brush
across
my
pants
I
wash
my
hands
Shit
hold
on
man
Motherfucker
Happy
birthday
to
Fuck
Shh
quiet
I
sit
in
silence
in
candlelit
environments
Sipping
Wild
Irish
while
getting
violent
Homicidal
visions
when
Im
spitting
like
this
But
really
Im
just
fulfilling
my
wish
of
killing
rhymes
Which
is
really
childish
and
silly
but
Im
really
like
this
Im
giving
nightmares
to
Billie
Eilish
Im

You

unеaten
fucking
What
honeybun
I

Now
I

money
falling
out
fiftiеs
hundreds
and
twenties
Twenties
And
I

Manchester

But
we

something
in
common
What
both

us
are
alarming
Foul
disgusting
and
awful
Yeah

repugnant
and
ugly
Yup
I
could
give
the
Boston
Marathon
a
run
for
its
money
yeah
And
you
could
say
Im
a
little
bit
immature
But
this
type
of
literature
got
me
a
little
richer
But
I
get
insecure
when
them
other
dudes
hit
on
you
girl
Youre
letting
em
fiddle
with
your
clitoris
Remember
you
were
my
fucking—
You

Up

script
You

That
I

You

Look

Always

smile
Mama

picked
on
at

Come
home
and
shed

She
never
sugarcoated
it
to
me
She
said
if
I
wasnt
so
stupid
and
ugly
I
wouldnt
always
get
bullied
True
I
think
of
my
struggles
Yeah
and
get
emotional
Could
be
cause
how
behind
the
eight-ball
and
far

hole
that
they
put
me
Now
Im
on
a
roll

Tootsie

a
stroller
cause

see
just
how
I
roll
if
you

what
I
do
this
music
for
When
I
was
goin

some
of
the
hardest
times
I
drew
from
her
But
shes
like
the
devil
cause
I
just
cant
let
loose
of
her
Plus
the
thought
of
losin
her
makes
me
wanna
just
let
loose
on
her
Then
I
hit
the
studio
tryna
rendezvous
with
her
Tell

butt-dial
girl

call
Haha
Thats
how
it

Fifty
Fuck

days
You

be
my
favorite
bitch
Thingsll

changed
Up
and
flipped
the
script
You
done
let
a
bunch
of
lames
fall
through
and
complain
That
I
cant
permit
You
aint

Nah
As
the
era
whence
we
came
Who
From
Nas
to
Pac
Rak
Yeah
Eric
B
and
Kane
I
know
But
I
know
a
few
from
this
era
that
are
lyrically
insane
And
although
most
are
never
gonna
hit
the
level
Cole
or
Weezy
at
Or
be
emotionally
attached
to
Yo
MTV
Raps
Yeah
Runnin
home
from
school
to
catch
an
episode
The
feeling
that
it
gave
you
to
rip
the
plastic
off
the
tape
You
hold
and
peel
it
back
yeah
Tear
it
off
then
play
it
What
I
swear
to
God
four
oclock
Wed
crowd
around
the
TV
Butter
in
his
underwear
and
socks
When
Nani
was
Kon
Artis
Yeah
and
Proof
had
his
hair
in
locs
Doody
Yeah
back
when
Flavor
Flav
had
us
wearing
clocks
Back
when
Back
when
Ed
Lover
Yeah
When
there
was
two
Dr
Dres
thats
a
paradox
Pair
of
Docs
But
I
never
thought
Id
get
so
jealous
At
the
thought
of
letting
you
go
psychologically
Its
gonna
bother
me
my
eyes
are
already
watery
Part
of
me
dont
wanna
stop
Yeah
til
I
get
you
back
Cause
I
gotta
put
the
work
in
and
tell
you

Other
part

to
tell
you
just
to
get
fucked
Go
back
to
whatever
dick
that
you
sucked
Ah
Get
back
together
with
them
you
slut
Givin
up
the
vagina
like
a
trip
to
the
gynecologist
When
I
helped
you
become
bigger
than
you
were
But
I
guess
that
it
slipped
your
mind
you
must
be
biding
your
time
Looking
for
someone
to
come
along
thatll
make
you
feel
like
I
did
back
when
you
were
mine
huh
Damn
But
truthfully
it
was
never
really
you
and
me
exclusively
And
theres
too
many
new
MCs
you
can
choose
between
But
no
matter
how
many
motherfuckers
ran
through
Bet
they
cant
do
it
like
me
But
I
cant
keep
burnin
the
candle
at
both
ends
And
I
cant
handle
it
when
I
leave
and
you
find
another
one
Now
I
gotta
take
this
beat
and
dismantle
it
I
wont
grieve
when
I
kill
you
But
if
I
cant
have
you
bitch
nobody
can
Hear

Hydrochloroquine
cause

The
Dark
Horse
Im
a
knight-mare
Mom

Times
Square
My
hair
trigger
whenever
I
get
an
idea
Fuck

like
a
sponge
mop
And
my
drip

a
drop

Im
the
illest
rapper
to
hold
a
cordless
Patrolling
corners
Looking
for
hookers
to
punch
in
the
mouth
with
a
roll
of
quarters
Im
meaner
in
action
Than
Rosco
beating
James
Tarteenyer

And
smackin
his
back
with
vacuum
cleaner
attachments
I
grew
up
in
the
wild
hood
As
a
hazardous
youth
With
a
fucked
up
childhood
That
I
used
as
an
excuse
And
aint
shit
changed
But
kept
the
same
mindstate
Since
the
third
time
that
I
failed
9th
grade
You
probably
think
that
Im
a
negative
person
dont
be
so
sure
of
it
I
dont
promote
violence
I
just
encourage
it
I
laugh
at
the
sight
of
death
As
I
fall
down
a
cement
flight
of
steps
And
land
inside
a
bed
of
spider
webs
So
throw
caution
to
the
wind
You
and
a
friend
Can
jump
off
of
a
bridge
and
if
you
live
do
it
again
Shit
why
not
Blow
your
brain
out
Im
blowing
mine
out
Fuck
it
you
only
live
once
you
might
as
well
die
now
Its
only
fair
to
warn
I
was
born
with
a
set
of
horns
And
metaphors
attached
to
my
damn
umbulical
cord
Warlord
of
rap
little
bastard
with
a
two

four
board
That
smashed
into
your
Honda
Accord
With

But

Developing

Eating

watching
you

death
With
an

your
veins
Feeding
you
liquid
darvicet
Pumping
you
full
of
drugs
Pull
the
plugs
On
the
gunshot
victims
full
of
bullet
slugs
Who
were
picked
up
in
an
ambulance
And
driven
To

And
given
A

Of

Storing

Doctor

To

Driving

Better

Ive

To

to
carpet
And
burn
up
your
entire
apartment
Im
a
liar
to
start

Got
your
bitch
wrapped
around
my
dick
So
tight
you
need
a
crobar
to
pry
her
apart
wit
Met
a
retarded
kid
named
Greg
with
a
wooden
leg
Snatched
it
off
and
beat
him
over
the
fucking
head
with
the
peg
Go

Wait

fell
to

floor
dead
No

closed
end
of
discussion
Im
blowin
up
like
spontaneous
human
combustion
Leaving
you
in
the
aftermath
of
holocaust
and
traumas
Cross
the
bombas

We
blowin
up
your
house
killing
your
parents
and
coming
back
to

your
foster
mommas
And
Im
as
good
at
keeping
a
promise
as
Nostradamus
Cause
I
aint
making
no
more
threats
Im
doing
drivebys
in
tinted
Corvettes
on
Vietnam
war

Im
more
or

sick
in
the
head
Maybe
more
cause
I

and

day
before
sabbath
Walk

block
with
a
labrador
Strapit

Coming

And

But

runnin
from

Sometimes

You
gotta
live
it
to
feel
it
you
didnt
you
wouldnt
get
it
Or
see
what
the
big
deal
is
why
it
was
and
it
still
is
To
be
walkin
this
borderline
of
Detroit
city
limits
Its
different
its
a
certain
significance
a
certificate
Of
authenticity
youd
never
even
see
But
its
everything
to
me
its
my
credibility
You
never
seen
heard
smelled
or
met
a
real
MC
Whos
incredible
upon
the
same
pedestal
as
me
But
yet
Im
still
unsigned
havin
a
rough
time
Sit
on
the
porch
with
all
my
friends
and
kick
dumb
rhymes
Go
to
work
and
serve
MCs
in
the
lunchline
But
when
it
comes
crunch
time
where
do
my
punchlines
go
Who
must
I
show
to
bust
my
flow
Where
must
I
go
who
must
I
know
Or
am
I
just
another
crab
in
the
bucket
Cause
I
aint
havin
no
luck
with
this
little
Rabbits
foot
fuck
it
Maybe
I
need
a
new
outlet
Im
startin
to
doubt
shit
Im
feelin
a
little
skeptical
who
I
hang
out
with
I
look
like
a
bum
yo
my
clothes
aint
about
shit
At
the
salvation
army
tryna
salvage
an
outfit
And
its
cold
tryna
travel
this
road
Plus
I
feel
like
Im
always
stuck
in
this
battlin
mode
My
defenses
are
so
up
but
one
thing
I
dont
want
Is
pity
from
no
one
this
city
is
no
fun
There
is
no
sun
and
its
so
dark
Sometimes
I
just
feel
like
Im
just
bein
pulled
apart
From
each
one
of
my
limbs
by
each
one
of
my
friends
Its
enough
to
just
make
me
wanna
jump
out
of
my
skin
Sometimes
I
feel
like
a
robot
sometimes
I
just
know
not
What
Im
doin
I
just
blow
my
head
is
a
stove
top
I
just
explode
the
kettle
gets
so
hot
Sometimes
my
mouth
just
overloads
the
gas
that
I
dont
got
But
Ive
learned
its
time
for
me
to
U-turn
Yo
it
only
takes
one
time
for
me
to
get
burned
Aint
no
falling
no
next
time
I
meet
a
new
girl
I
can
no
longer
play
stupid
or
be
immature
I
got
every
ingredient
all
I
need
is
the
courage
Like
I
already
got
the
beat
all
I
need
is
the
words
Got
the
urge
suddenly
its
a
surge
Suddenly
a
new
burst
of
energy
has
occurred
Time
to
show
these
free
world
leaders
at
three
in
the
third
I
am
no
longer
scared
now
Im
free
as
a
bird
Then
I
turn
and
cross
over
the
median
curb
Hit
the
‘burbs
and
all
you
see
is
a
blur
from
8
mile
road
Im
a
man
Ima
make
a
new
plan
Its
alright
its
okay
Time
for
me
to
just
stand
up
and
travel
new
land
Im
gonna
make
it
anyway
Time
for
me
to
just
take
matters
into
my
own
hands
Gonna
make
it
cant
give
up
now
Once
Im
over
these
tracks
man
Ima
never
look
back
Ima
make
it
somehow
8
mile
road
And
Im
gone
I
know
right
where
Im
going
Its
alright
its
okay
Sorry
mama
Im
grown
I
must
travel

Im
gonna
make
it

Aint

Gonna

Everybody
Put

[Verse

Eminem]
Everywhere
we
go
people
know
that
we
roll
deep
as
fuck
Fourty
fifty
Samoans
they
knowing
when
D-Bo
was
50
Tweezy
Obie
there
wont
be
no
hoe
in
us
They
pop
shit
like
they
gon
do
shit
but
no
one
does
From
New
York
down
to
Texas
back
up
to
Los
Angeles
Weve
changed
the
way
we
move
so
man
up
if
you
cant
adjust
You
may
end
up
getting
rushed
by
too
many
to
handle
us
Its
funny
I
guess
money
does
have
its
advantages
And
it
isnt
that
we
just
think
that
we
cant
be
touched
Its
not
like
were
just
feeling
ourselves
that
much
Its
just
that
if
someone
ever
does
put
us
in
the
clutch
We
just
know
that
yall
aint
gon
be
the
one
whos
gon
do
it
Cause
first
of
all
youre
pussy
and
everybody
can
see
that
You
fuck
around
get
caught
in
a
spot
that
you
shouldnt
be
at
That
you
got
no
business
being
in
we
aint
even
gon
be
in
it
No
ones
gunna
hear
nothing
no
ones
gunna
see
this
shit
And
theyll
be
in
and
up
out
of
it
them
boys
is
bout
it
bout
it
The
noise
from

be
drowned
out
by
the
crowd
And
youll
be
laying
on
the
ground
getting
trampled
by
people
dancing
Till
the
club
closes
and
clears
out
And
thats
when
they
see
you
flatened
Nobody
saw
it
happen
all
cause
your
jaws
are
flapping
And
you
couldnt
stop
yapping
and
took
it
past
rapping
It
aint
about
the
music
no
more
its
bout
trying
to
show
off
And
it
feels
like
any
minute
the
bomb
is
bout
to
go
off
[Chorus
-
Eminem]
Shits
about
to
change
cause
we
aint
playing
no
games
We
aint
budging
neither
are
they
we
aint
saying
no
names
Shit
just
aint
the
same
when
the
Aks
gettin
sprayed
cause
Hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
911
It
aint
about
hip-hop
cause
those
days
are
gone
It
aint
about
trying
rip
shots
to
get
props
no
more
Its
about
trying
not
to
get
popped
and
get
dropped
to
the
floor
Cause
hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
911
[Verse

B-Real]
Step

my
holster
cause

getting
serious
All

How

Some

Mistake

We

Allusions

If

minute
to

about
what

done
When

Got

like
a
rolling
stone
homie
I
got
you
under
my
thumb
Silly
little
bitches

end

right
up
in
ditches
We
cut
you
and
give
you
stitches
for
envy
and
all
my
riches
Your
games
just
like
a
midget
youre
clocking
a
small
digit
Dealing
with
the
Giant
Goliath
people
thats
how
we
live
it
cmon
[Chorus]
about
to
change
cause
we
aint
playing
no
games
We
aint
budging
neither
are
they
we
aint
saying
no
names
Shit
just
aint
the
same
when
the
Aks
gettin
sprayed
cause
Hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
911
It
aint
about
hip-hop
cause
those
days
are
gone
It
aint
about
trying
rip
shots
to
get
props
no
more
Its
about
trying
not
to
get
popped
and
get
dropped
to
the
floor
Cause
hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
911
[Verse

Ganxsta
Ridd]
Uh
gangsta
Ganxsta
who
come
to
pay
you
a
visit
On
this
shit
you
call
hip-hop
this
function
is
where
did
it
When
I
-
put
it
in
motion
my
focus
is
getting
branded
My
appetite
for
destruction
is
blasted
because
I
said
it
Got
you
-
stumbling
for
cover
this
music
dying
in
numbers
But
you
wouldnt
pause
and
wonder
admitting
its
all
glamour
When
you
-
enter
the
business
you
thinking
you
running
shit
You
witness
that
funny
shit
your
bitches
they
aint
shit
We
gangstas
we
blast
first
ask
questions
later
All
these
-
imitators
parading
like
they
some
playas
Trying
to
-
save
hip-hop
the
task
is
something
greater
Cause
we
old
fashioned
coded
with
loyalty
motivaters
Get
caught
Im
not
telling
or
more
like
killing
not
caring
Im
riding
a
-
gangsta
feeling
no
fearing
when
gangstas
dying
Im
in
a
-
full
circle
with
homies
thats
supposed
to
bleed
On
an
8
Mile
mission
with
Cypress
and
OGs
[Chorus]
about
to
change
cause
we
aint
playing
no
games
We
aint
budging
neither
are
they
we
aint
saying
no
names
Shit
just
aint
the

So
young
so
full
of
life
and
vibrant
Side
by
side
wherever
you
was
ridin
I
went
So
close
almost
was
some
Bonnie
and
Clyde
shit
When
Ronnie
died
you
was
right
by
my
side
With
a
shoulder
to
cry
on
and
a
tissue
to
wipe
my
eyes
And
a
bucket
to
catch
every
tear
I
cried
inside
it
You
even
had
the
same
type
of
childhood
I
did
Sometimes
I
just
wanna
know
why
Is
it
that
you
surcame
to
yours
And
mine
I
survived
it
You
ran
the
streets
I
nine
to
fived
it
We
grew
up
grew
apart
as
time
went
by
us
Then
I
blew
up
to
both
yours
and
mine
surprises
Now
I
feel
the
vibe
I
just
cant
describe
it
Much
as
your
pride
tries
to
hide
it
Youre
cold
your
touch
its
like
ice
And
your
eyes
is
the
look
of
resentment
I
can
sense
it
and
I
dont
like
it
A

All

off

Ready
for
the
showdown
to
go
down
at
1
Sweat
on
my
brow
lets
settle
it
now
Imma
show
you
how
real
cowboys
get
down
Im
polishin
gold
waiting
for
this
drama
to
unfold
I
got
a
blunt
rolled
Feelin
bold
gangstas
blood
run
cold
Its
time
to
reload
this
old
45
Colt
And
the
wind
gust
its
hot
and
muggy
dusty
Bust
a
couple
shots
make
sure
Im
not
rusty
Its
passed
noon
he
should
be
here
soon
I
sip
a
little
moonshine
inside
a
saloon
All
of
a
sudden
I
could
hear
the
sound
of
hoofs
Sounds
like
a
thousand
wolves
I
cock
back
put
the
toast
in
the
holster
and
frooze
I
pose
like
a
poster
hes
closer
than
close
I
hold
the
heat
sturdy
I
heard
he
fights
dirty
But
Imma
put
thirty
inside
him
and
leave
early
And
just
when
I
went
to
fill
him
with
hot
lead
I
put
the
gun
to
his
head
and
this
is
what
he
said
[Eminem]
You
never
met
me
and
youll
probably
never
see
me
again
But
I
know
you
the
names
Slim
You
want
revenge
Then
dont
shoot
Im
in
the
same
boots
as
you
Im
telling
the
truth
I
got
a
price
on
my
head
too
Cuz
when
you
1
-
Ride
like
a
cowboy
toward
the
sun
When
life
aint
fun
when
youre
on
the
run
Got
your
gold
and
you
got
your
gun
But
life
as
an
outlaw
just
begun
Got
your
shotgun
by
your
side
Got
your
horse
and
you
got
your
pride
You
ride
till
there
aint
no
place
to
hide
Its
sad
cuz
the
bad
guys
always
die
[Dre]
He
was
shady
could
see
it
by
the
look
on
his
face
He
said
take
ten
paces
shit
I
took
eight
Spun
around
and
I
aimed
straight
for
the
brain
My
shit
went
bang
but
it
only
fired
a
blank
he
said
[Eminem]
You
need
bullets
hurry
up
run
[Dre]
I
put
a
clip
in
the
gun
and
pointed
at
his
lungs
He
pulled
two
at
the
same
time
and
stood
stunned
[Eminem]
Go
ahead
shoot
me
but
Im
not
the
one
you
want
[Dre]
I
figured
he
was
telling
the
truth
Thats
why
I
didnt
shoot
So
what
we
gonna
do
Its
on
you
[Eminem]
Do
you
recall
when
you
and
Snoop
was
a
group
[Dre]
The
Chronic
[Eminem]
Well
all
we
gotta
do
is
find
a
map
to
part
two
And
plus
I
know
whos
got
it
Who
Some
old
dude
hes
got
26
plagues
and
he
already
sold
two
[Dre]
Loaded
up
my
saddle
got
ready
for
battle
Hid
two
pieces
of
gold
inside
of
my
saddle
We
rolled
two
miles
until
we
hit
the
spot
An
old
ghost
town
that
everybody
forgot
A
place
where
they
used
to
smoke
chronic
a
lot
Slim
grabbed
the
shotgun
[Eminem]
Dre
heres
the
plot
This
is
the
spot
they
call
him
Doc
Loveless
Hes
going
around
saying
he
took
the
game
from
us
[Dre]
Lets
shoot
him
in
his
kneecaps
hell
never
see
it
coming
[Eminem]
He
aint
got
no
legs
they
cut
em
off
at
the
stomach
Hes
got
mechanical
legs
and
spins
webs
Plus
hes
well
respected
by
the
hip-hop
heads
Our
mission
is
to
get
him
to
stop
laying
eggs
And
we
can
put
him
on
his
back
down
a
flight
of
steps
[Dre]
I
drew
two
guns
spun
them
on
my
fingers
Kicked
the
swinging
doors
in
and
started
gun
slinging
I
could
hear
somebody
singing
It
sounded
like
a
G
Thang
in
a
verse
from
Keep
Their
Heads
Ringing
I
said
its
Dres
Day
and
started
to
spray
Its
eighteen
hundred
he
proves
a
AK
Hollow
tips
started
flying
every
which
way
[Eminem]
Thats
when
I
seen
Dre
in
trouble
then
came
the
brigades
I
fired
the
first
shot
spun
his
body
around
He
hit
the
ground
and
landed
upside
down
Dre
grabbed
the
map
the
plagues
and
the
gold
I
grabbed
two
girlies
and
a
blunt
thats
rolled
Repeat
1
Repeat

No

Why

I

and

[Chorus
Two]
{Just

People

that
Im

I

They

[Eminem]
Im
the
illest
rapper
to
hold
the
cordless
patrollin
corners
Looking
for
hookers
to
punch
in
the
mouth
with
a
roll
of
quarters
Im
meaner
in
action
than
Roscoe
beatin
James
Todd
Sr
across
the
back
with
vacuum
cleaner
attachments
{Ow
Ow
Ow}
I
grew
up
in
a
wild
hood
as
a
hazardous
youth
with
a
fucked
up
childhood
that
I
used
as
an
excuse
And
aint
shit
changed
I
kept
the
same
mindstate
since
the
third
time
that
I
failed
9th
grade
You
probably
think
that
Im
a
negative
person
dont
be
so
sure
of
it
I
dont
promote
violence
I
just
encourage
it
{cmon}
I
laugh
at
the
sight
of
death
as
I
fall
down
a
cement
flight
of
steps
{ahhhhhhhh}
and
land
inside
a
bed
of
spider
webs
So
throw
caution
to
the
wind
you
and
a
friend
can
jump
off
of
a
bridge
and
if
you
live
do
it
again
Shit
why
not
blow
your
brain
out
Im
blowin
mine
out
Fuck
it
you
only
live
once
you
might
as
well
die
now

Three]

My
laser

gon
make
you
take
a
razor
to
your
wrist
Make
you
satanistic
make
you
take
the
pistol
to
your
face
and
place
the
clip
and
cock
it
back
and
let
it
go
until
your
brains
are
rippin
out
your
skull
so
bad
to
sew
you
back
would
be
a
waste
of
stitches
Im
not
a
Role
Model
I
dont
wanna
babysit
kids
I
got
one
little
girl
and
Hailey
Jade
is
Shadys
business
And
Shadys
just
an
alias
I
made
to
make
you
pissed
off
Where
the
fuck
were
you
when
Gil
was
paid
to
make
me
dishwash
I
make
a
couple
statements
and
now
look
how
crazy
shit
got
You
made
me
get
a
bigger
attitude
than
eighty
Kim
Scotts
And
she
almost
got
the
same
fate
that
Gradys
bitch
got
I
knew
that
Just
the
Two
of
Us
would
make
you
hate
me
this
much
And
Just
the
Two
of
Us
that
aint
got
shit
to
do
with
us
and
our
personal
life
its
just
words
on
a
mic
So
you
can
call
me
a
punk
a
pervert
or
a
chauvinist
pig
But
the
funny
shit
is
that
I
still
go
with
the
bitch
[Chorus

Rammed

Rappers

[Verse

I
had
a
dream
I
was
gettin
jacked
by
biters
It
felt
like
I
was
bein
attacked
by
spiders
Developin
a
fear
of
biterphobia
Im
holdin
a
gas
can
and
lighter
over
ya
If
I
detect
ya
-
Im
a
pulverize
Dissect
your
brain
diggin
in
your
skulls
for
lies
And
Im
a
torture
-
with
material
iller
That
a
stark
ravin
mad
serial
killer
But
Im
more
dangerous
-
than
a
loaded
chamber
is
A
major
risk
to
a
plagiarist
So
beware
of
the
aira
A
terror
for
horrible
Will
scare
ya
tomorrow
is
the
airbone
assault
of
rappers
Hit
the
source
to
better
my
skills
I
head
for
the
border
And
run
Galloping
Hills
The
choice
is
yours
Cause
now
buddys
noises
force
me
to
scream
til
my
voice
is
hoarse
Cause
Im
sick
of
these
jabber
jaws
and
crap
that
grab
at
yours
And
savage
yours
to
bite
like
Labradors
In
the
range
of
my
double-barrel
And
your
like
is
in
danger
trouble
and
peril
[Chorus:]
Ready
or

[scratches]
Do

[scratches]
Eat

Do

[Verse
3:]
I
trample
and
stamp
liars
likethey
werr
campfires
Cause
vampires
right
on
my
balls
like
clamp
pliers
And
swing
on
my
thingamajig
So
Im
bringin
my
nig
Proof
for
backup
when
I
sing
at
my
gig
Cause
biters
are
fallin
head
over
heels
In
love
with
every
rhyme
that
Ive
said
over
reels
Thats
how
I
became
paranoid
Chewin
my
fingernails
pullin
my
hair
annoyed
Cause
every
time
you
bit
it
was
deliberate
So
Im
forced
to
hit
a
little
quicker
with
An
ultimatum
I
assault
and
slayed
em
With
rhymes
and
its
ultimatum
just
to
cultivate
em
Energetic
and
imaginative
Pronouns
and
verbsm
predicates
and
adjectives
Will
reach
out
and
grab
ya
nine
times
outta
ten
Thats
why
Im
spilling
one
of
a
kind
rhymes
out
a
pen
[Chorus:]
Everybody

Everybody

Jumped
out

floor
of
a
record
store
With
a
Treacherous
Four
cassette
and
a
cassette
recorder
In
Ecuador
with
Edward
Norton
Witness
the
metamorphosis
Of
a
legend
growin
like
an
expert
swordsman
From
the
Hessian
War
and
Hence
the
origin
of
the
Headless
Horseman
Born
with
the
endorphins
of
a
pathetic
orphan
Endless
sores
and
reservoir
Of
extension
cords
in
dresser
drawers
And
deadbolts
on
the
bedroom
doors
And
sexual
torture
kits
kept
in
a
separate
storage
bin
Excellent
boyfriend
Use
intercourse
to
settle
scores
With
women
who
have
been
vendettas
towards
men
Dckhead
is
forced
in
and
the
shredded
foreskin
Red
is
torn
and
theyre
only
bein
fed
a

Bed
sores
in
sore
shins
Pregnant

Fetish

Skeletor
I
went
to
Hell
and
fell

A

With

his

Are

Appetite

doesnt
have
to
answer

no
one

great
idea
If
I
was
president
gettin
off
is
The
first
order
of
business
once
I
get
in
office
Second
thing
thatll
make
me
happys
walkin
up
to
Uncle
Sam
Naked
laughing
dck
cupped
in
hand
Screaming
Fck
safe
sex
Throw
a
latex
and
an
AIDS
test
at
him
Tell
Congress
I
run
this
land
And
I
want
the
rubber
banned
and
make
it
snappy
Addiction
to
friction
and
static
Addict
who
cant
escape
the
habit
Its
in
you
to
chase
the
dragon
But
as
fate
would
have
it
I
walked
up
in
major
Magics
Dressed
as
the
maintenance
man
In
a
laser
tag
vest
and
a
racin
jacket
with
a
gauge
to
blast
it
And
sped
away
in
the
station
wagon
Stacey
Dashs
and
Casey
Anthonys
Crazy
asses
in
the
backseat
Throwin
Stay-Free
pads
at
me
Dead
passenger
in
the
passenger
seat
Unfasten
the
safety
latches
And
slam
on
the
brakes
in
traffic
so
hard
I
snapped
the
relocation
brackets
for
the
monster
tires
Finna
get
a
murder
case
and
catch
it
Like
you
threw
it
at
me
encased
in
plastic
And
send
Dylan
Roof
through
the
windshield
of
the
Benz
Until
he
spins
like
a
pinwheel
and
begins
feelin
Like
a
windmill
with
a
thin
bill
while
his
skins
peelin
And
skids
til
he
hits
a
cement
pillar
Swing
for
the
fence
like
Prince
Fielder
Knock
it
into
the
upper
peninsula
You
want
to
go
against
zilla
The
Rap
God
When
will
I
quit
Never
been
realer
The
in-stiller
of
fear
not
even
a
scintilla
of
doubt
Whose
pens
iller
than
Prince
in
a
chinchilla
Or
Ben
Stiller
in
a
suspense
thriller
Revenge
killer
of
bin
syllable
binge
Fill
a
syringe
till
I
Draw
first
blood
Even
pop
sit
on
my
pop
sit
and
its
popular
Couldnt
be
more
awkwarder
Cause
youre
innocence
I
robbed
you
of
Its
my
fingers
that
got
stuck
up
Tortured
a
not
give
a
Slapstick
hockey
puck
The
broad
hunter
with
the
sawed
off
Like
an
arm
when
its
lopped
off
of
ya
But
Im
not
gonna
get
the
shotgun
Or
the
Glock
Im
gonna
opt
for
the
ox
Cause
Im
into
objects
that
are
sharp
when
I
sharpen
Its
not
a
shock
Im
such
an
obnoxious
fcker
The
rock
cuts
into
rock
cause
who
would
have
thought
This
much
of
a
cocksucker
that
go
across
the
buttocks
of
Vivica
Fox
with
a
box
cutter
That
was
for
50
little
slap
on
the
wrist
be
warned
Im
unrevealing
quickly
My
squabbles
Im
grappling
with
your
time
traveling
with
me
Try
and
follow
as
I
wobble
relapse
into
history
with
a
flask
of
the
whiskey
Tip
it
back
then
Im
twisting
wine
bottles
Like
what
happened
to
Chris
Reeves
spine
column
Thats
the
plan
of
attack
when
Im
fixing
my
problems
Wish
my
chest
wasnt
having
to
get
these
rhymes
off
em
But
the
fact
that
I
have
so
many
rappers
against
me
mind
boggles
And
why
I
had
to
come
back
on
these
faggots
who
diss
me
is
More
of
a
spectacular
mystery
than
a
fcking
Agatha
Christie
crime
novel
But
my
patience
is
wearing
thin
Swear
I
been
contemplating
rubbing
sht
in
your
face
till
I
smear
it
in
Diss
you
in
every
lyric
until
you
fear
the
pen
And
never
appear
again
If
you
actually
had
fcking
careers
to
end
But
then
I
think
of
Molly
Qerim
and
I
steer
em
in
that
direction
and
forget
my
ideas
for
them
Molly
Im
gone
off
you
Man
light
some
kush
Youre
my
first
take
Ill
nail
you
Cant
lie
I
gush
If
I
won
you
over
you
would
be
the
grand
prize
Im
entranced
by
your
looks
come
and
give
the
Shady
franchise
a
push
You
can
get
it
in
a
can
like
some
Anheuser
Busch
Jeans
too
small
least
three
pant
sizes
tush
Mushed
against
your
damn
side
you
puss
And
thighs
are
squooshed
What
kind
of
attires
that
Im
ready
to
be
rode
Psychopath
bet
you
well
get
it
popping
like
a
flat
Light
the
match
to
ignite
the
wrath
Got
knives
to
slash
and
slice
hermaphrodites
in
half
Piper
Chapmans
might
just
have
to
picket
me
Like
a
scab
Hard
to
describe
in
fact
Startling
violent
perhaps
Are
things
that
come
to
mind
as
soon
as
I
start
spitting
rhymes
like
that
And
you
arent
really
surprised
at
that
But
as
far
as
these
lines
I
rap
And
these
bars
wouldnt
dial
it
back
if
I
star
69ed
the
track
Instinctive
nature
to
bring
the
anguish
yeah
to
the
English
language
With
this
ink
you
haters
get
wrote
on
like
a
piece
of
paper
This
rap

Cause

Til

With

Bitch

In

Now

And

Somethin

Yo
alright
yo
Im
possessed
by
evil
demons
that
torture
me
while
Im
sleeping
I
keep
dreaming
of
death
and
Im
hearing
people
screaming
The
devils
spirits
trapped
inside
me
and
I
want
it
out
Im
on
the
couch
bleeding
to
death
in
a
haunted
house
With
both
of
my
wrists
slit
Im
lifted
up
in
the
air
And
suspended
in
animation
like
someones
holding
me
there
I
feel
somebodys
cold
hands
wrapping
around
my
neck
While
I
choke
on
my
own
blood
that
I
swallow
and
drown
to
death
But
I
found
a
breath
and
somehow
managed
to
slip
the
clutches
Nearly
blacking
out
from
dizziness
and
head
rushes
Tripping
over
ODd
bodies
of
dead
lushes
Bloodstains
paint
the
plush
carpet
like
red
blushes
Doors
open
and
close
by
themselves
books
fly
off
shelves
Curtains
catch
fire
the
house
melts
My
skin
blisters
and
sticks
together
like
twin
sisters
The
wind
blows
and
shatters
windows
like
ten
twisters
Caught
a
piece
of
shrapnel
in
the
Adams
apple
Two
cups
of
holy
water
and
Im
looking
at
em
half
full
But
as
soon
as
I
go
to
touch
em
they
turn
into
red
rum
It
got
silent
then
all
these
voices
said
Come
follow
me
into
the
pits
of
Hell
I
heard
em
yell
Welcome
to
the
Norman
Bates
Motel
I
ring
the
bell
for
service
and
I
was
greeted
by
his
mother
Covered
in
dry
blood
head
still
dented
from
the
shovel
I
said
I
need
a
room
so
I
could
try
to
get
some
rest
She
gave
me
the
keys
to
the
best
suite
and
a
bag
of
cess
And
told
me
thats
just
for
starters
Satanll
be
in
to
see
me
later
To
see
if
Im
interested
in
being
partners
Thanks

do
me
now
but
somehow
I
know
youre
near
me
in
presence
oh
I
went
and
drop
some
presents
off
to
ease
it
to
them
two
little
beautiful
boys
of
yours
to
try
to
ease
their
minds
a
little
and

youll
never
believe
this
but
Sharonda

talks
to
me
now
Jesus
and
everyone
else
is
just
tryna
pick
up
the
pieces
man
how
you
touch
so
many
fucking
lives
and
just
leave
us
they
say
grievance
has
a
way
of
affecting
everyone
different
if
its
true
how
the
fuck
am
I
supposed
to
get
over
you
Difficult
as
it
sounds
[Verse
2]
Doody
thats
what
we
call
each
other
I
dont
know
where
it
came
from
but
it
just
stuck
with
us
we
was
always
brothers
never
thought
about
each
others
skin
colours
til
one
day
we
was
walking
up
the
block
in
the
summer
it
was
like
90
degrees
I
was
catching
a
sun
burn
tryna
walk
under
the
trees
just
to
give
me
some
comfort
Im
moaning
I
just
wanna
get
home
when
I
look
over
and
your
shirt
is
off
Im
like
you
gonna
fry
and
like
No
I
wont
Im
black
stupid
and
black
people
they
got
melatonin
in
their
skin
we
dont
burn
meanwhile
my
face
is
glowing
and
I
felt
like
Im
on
fire
and
the
entire
time
youre
just
laughing
at
me
and
snapping
at
me
with
your
shirt
bastard
and
I
still
have
to
get
you
back
for
that
shit
and
by
the
way
them
playboy
rings
my
mother
stole
from
you
well
Nate
finally
got
em
back
shit
it
must
have
been
at
least
16
years
ago
well
I
put
em
in
your
cask-ahhh
moving
past
it
it
still
aint
registered
yet
but
you
can
bet
your
legacy
theyll
never
forget
the
motor
city
motown
hip
hop
vet
hip
hop
shop
dreads
it
dont
stop
there
Yeah
as
difficult
as
it
sounds
[Verse
3]
And
this
may
sound
a
little
strange
but
Imma
tell
it
I
found
that
jacket
that
you
left
at
my
wedding
and
I
picked
it
up
to
smell
it
I
wrapped
it
up
in
plastic
until
I
put
it
in
glass
and
hang
it
up
in
the
hallway
so
I
can
always
look
at
it
and
as
for
all
of
me
and
D12
we
feel
like
fuck
rap
it
feels
like
our
General
just
fucking
died
in
our
lap
we
shut
off
all
our
pages
all
our
cell
numbers
has
changed
our
two-ways
are
in
the
trash
so
some
cats
will
have
to
find
a
new
way
and
I
know
that
it
feels
like
the
dreams
will
die
with
you
today
but
the
truth
is
there
all
still
here
and
you
aint
Purple
Gang
you
gotta
keep
pressing
on
dont
ever
give
up
the
dream
dawg
I
got
love
for
you
all
and
Doody
its
true
you
bought
people
together
who
never
woulda
been
in
the
same
room
if
it
wasnt
for
you
you
were
the
peacemaker
Doody
I
know
sometimes
you
were
moody
but
you
hated
confrontation
and
truly
hated
the
feuding
but
you
were
down
for
yours
whenever
it
came
to
scrapping
if
it
had
to
happen
it
had
to
happen
believe
me
I
know
youre
the
one
who
taught
me
to
throw
them
balls
back
on
Dresden
from
making
cars
to
paintballing
getting
arrested
to
sitting
across
from
each
other
in
cells
laughing
and
jesting
they
tried
to
hit
us
for
5
years
for
that
no
question
I
guess
them
hookers
and
bums
that
we
shot
up
didnt
show
up
for
court
so
we
got
off
on
a
technicality
left
sweating
me
you
and
whats
his
face
I
forgot
his
fucking
name
shame
he
even
came
to
your
funeral
he
betrayed
our
team
and
if
I
see
him
again
Ima
punch
him
in
the
fucking
face
and
thats
on
Hallie
Jade
Whitney
Lane
and
Alainas
name
I
let
the
pistol
bang
once
just
to
leak
a
shot
in
the
air
for
you
and
pour
some
liquor
out
for
you
with
Obie
in
the
parking
lot
of
54
just
before
we
were
supposed
to
get
in

to
come
and
see
you

Paroles
de
la
chanson
Fuckin
Backstabber
par
Eminem
Song
is
hard
to
hear
corrections
appreciated
This
is
a
song
from
before
Eminem
was
famous
After
a
phone
call
between
Kim
and
Champtown
the
song
begins
[sample]
Fuck
it
Friends
or
no
friends
I
had
enough
bullshit
to
last
me
clear
to
the
ends[4x]
[Eminem]
I
shoulda
been
able
to
see
that
you
were
the
one
behind
this
but
i
was
blind
as
fuck
to
see
that
you
were
the
kind
that
stuck
some
more
in
the
spine
this
It
was
another
friendship
broke
in
half
and
watch
you
turn
everything
into
a
game
and
joke
and
laugh
and
both
of
us
know
we
cant
discuss
the
situation
I
just
hold
this
confrontation
just
revolts
and
accusations
and
insults
so
Im
just
let
it
go
from
that
we
need
to
be
I
told
you
now
from
that
what
goes
around
comes
back
around
believe
me
duck
from

Take
a
second
to
stop

think
about
what
you
done
and
you
woulda
thought
that
being
a
friend
Instead
of
what
you
won
All
because
of
what
you
run
your
mouth
you
wanna
prance
around
and
gloat
Lets
see
how
well
you
dance
around

got
my
hands
around
your
throat
Cause
Its
a
matter
of
time
till
I
get
my
blows
in
and
it
wont
be
long
You
shouldnt
go
walkin
around
and
stickin
your
nose
in
where
it
dont
belong
Cause
everytime
you
talked
when
you
was
stretchin
the
truth
Theres

flyin
up
but
you
gonna
catch

the
chin

:
Proof]

[Outro
:Proof]
Backstabbers
dont
live
too
long
Around
my
way
friendships
betrayed
In
the
hood
you
die
for
that
For
those
that
dont
love
this
combat
and
verbally
say
this
This
could
relate
to
the
death
of
a
backstabber
Thats
like
the
desire
to
make
social
distant
vibration
combustion
of
the
neck
The
backstabber
for
the
female
you
sleezin
ass
bitch
nigga
So
remember
the
backstabber
always
loses
in
the
end
A
friend
is
a
friend
to
the
end
F-R-I
for
Fri
E-N-D
a
friend
for
the
endyes
To
eternitythe
backstabber
shall
never
flourish

As

And

Leave

One

But

Ima

and
walk
leavin
the

I
smoke
til
I
choke
and
I
sex
a
lot
I

a
cross
on
my
chain
but
its
just
a
rock
Now
if
I

everynight

Do
I

tight
You

I

worse
I

and
then
I

Since

See

wearin

Nordface
Nickle

God

Analyze

And
of

Im

stranger
to

Like
Christ
in
a
manger
feel
a
whole
range
of
my
anger
I
breathe
down
shit
so
hard
you
can
see
sound
And
beat
down
these
rap
clowns
in
like
three
rounds
My
pen
bout
as
sharp
as
a
dagger
walk
with
a
swagger
Tie
your
wife
to
the
back
of
a
black
Jag
and
I
drag
her
Ten
blocks
untie
the
bitch
and
I
still
bag
her
Give
her
a
smack
in
the
ass
and
a
six
pack
of
lager
My
shit
go
as
deep
and
as
dark
as
a
train
tunnel
My
flows
spill
like
usin
the
wrong
end
of
a
funnel
Everyday
I
grow
more
older
and
more
colder
Fly
you
to
Colorado
roll
you
over
with
a
Boulder
I
know
you
want
to
retaliate
but
you
wont
dare
Cause

fuckin
with
some
niggaz
like
this
who
just
dont
care
Chorus
[J-Black]
But
every

So

sees
my
vision
when
I
play
it
for
em
They
just
say
its
wack
They
dont
know
what
dope
is
And
I
dont
know
if
I
was
awake
or
asleep
When
I
wrote
this
All
I
know
is
you
came
to
me
when
I
was
at
my
lowest
You
picked
me
up
breeding
life
in
me
I
owe
my
life
to
you
Before
the
life
of
me
I
dont
see
why
you
dont
see
like
I
do
But
it
just
dawned
on
me
you
lost
a
son
See
this
light
in
you
its
dark
Let
me
turn
on
the
lights
and
brighten
me
and
enlighten
you
I
dont
think
you
realise
what
you
mean
to
me
Not
the
slightest
clue
Cause
me
and
you
were
like
a
crew
I
was
like
your
sidekick
You
gon
either
wanna
fight
me
when
I
get
off
this
fucking
mic
Or
you
gon
hug
me
But
Im
not
an
option
theres
nothing
else
I
can
do
cause
Im
about
to
lose
my
mind
Youve

You

Im
puzzled
Cause

lazy
or
you
dont
believe
in
you

more
Seems
like
your
own
opinions
not
one
you
can
form
Cant
make
a
decision
you
keep
questioning
yourself
Second
guessing
and
its
almost
like
your
begging
for
my
help
Like
Im
your
leader
Your
susposed
to
fucking
be
my
mentor
I
can
endure
no
more
I
demand
you
remember
who
you
are
It
was
YOU
who
believed
in
me
When
everyone
was
telling
you

me
Everyone

the
fucking
label

tell
the
truth
You
risked
your
career
for

for
me

Before

When

out
of
fame
Like
someone
doused
the
flame
And
they
became
destined
To
never
jump
around
again
Or
even
further
back
When
I
first
had
heard
the
knack
When
you
were
down
with

I
went
to

Yo

[Eminem]
I
used
to
be
a
lonely
man
only
mad
until
I
got
a
million
dollars
shit
Now
if
i
only
had
some
fucking
hair
Id
pull
it
faster
than
a
bullet
Out
of
Tupacs
chest
before
the
ambulance
came
too
late
to
do
it
Im
trying
to
grow
it
back
again
it
was
an
accident
I
had
my
back
against
the
fan
and
chopped
it
off
in
Amsterdam
I
hate
the
straight
jacket
it
aint
latching
and
cant
lock
it
So
they
stapled
my
hand
to
my
pants
pockets
The
cells
padded
and
battered
like
someone
else
had
it
Before
me
and
just
kept
throwing
they
fucking
selfs
at
it
My
head
is
aching
Im
dedicated
to
medication
But
this
med
is
taking
to
long
to
bring
me
this
sedadation
Come
on
Anyway
I
got
down
with
Dre
What
up
The
first
man
who
taught
me
how
the
glock
sounded
to
spray
Running
up
and
down
the
street
screaming
Fuck
the
Police
When
you
still
had
your
mothers
fucking
Nipple
stuck
in
your
teeth
Fucking

Became
a
role
model
after
Colorado
Now
all
they
do
is
follow
me
around
and
holla
Bravo
Hell

I
punch
my
bitch
and
beat
my
kids
in
public
Suck

dick

Im
sick
enough
to
fuck
a
man
in
his
face
but
I
wont
Cause
youll
probably
wanna
stand
in
his
place
So
put
a
sock
in
it
with
your
fake-ass
Tupac
image
You
faggots
aint
tough
you
just
get
drunk
and
become
talkative
Wanna
Fight
Im
probably
the
akwardest
alcoholic
talking
Walking
like
a
midget
with
a
ladder
in
his
back
pocket
So
when
you
see
me
on
your
block
stumbling
mumbling
A
bunch
of
dumb
shit
like
my
drunk
uncle
does
I
aint
buzzed
Imm
juss
high
on

So
why
on

whirling
tire
I

it
upset
me
Cause

They

what

to
be
so
fed
up
And

get
up
My
minds
got
a
mind
of
its
own
sometimes
I
cant
find
it
at
home
It
hides
in
the
stove

[Eminem
And
Dr
Dre

up

Then
I
might
not

moving
Off

Fuck

shit

Lets
get
the
fuck
out
of
here
You
know
how
we
do
echo
Ah
yeah
Its
like
this
like
this
This
is
Eminem
baby
back
up
in
that
motherfucking
ass
Til
forever
til
forever
One
time
for
your
motherfuckin
mind
For
MCs
MCs
We
represent
the
313
you
know
what
Im
saying
Yo
they
dont
know
shit
about
this
for
the
96
Ayo
my
pen
and
paper
cause
a
chain
reaction
To
get
your
brain
relaxin
the
zany
actin
maniac
in
action
A
brainiac
in
fact
son
you
mainly
lack
attraction
You
look
insanely
wack
when
just
a
fraction
of
my
tracks
run
My
rhymin
skills
got
you
climbin
hills
I
travel
through
your
mind
and
chill
your
spine
like
siren
drills
Im
slimin
grills
of
roaches
with
spray
that
disinfects
And
twistin
necks
of
rappers
Til
their
spinal
column
disconnects
Put
this
in
decks
and
check
the
monologue
Turn
your
system
up
twist
em
up
And
indulge
in
the
marijuana
smog
This
is
the
season
for
noise
pollution
contamination
Examination
of
more
car-tunes
than
animation
My
lamination
of
narration
Hits
a
snare
and
bass
on
a
track
for
duck
rapper
interrogation
When
I
declare
invasion
There
aint
no
time
to
be
starin
gazin
I
turn
the
stage
into
a
barren
wasteland
Im
Infinite
you
heard
of
Hell
Well
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
Im
trying
to
repent
from
it
But
when
I
hear
the
beat
Im
tempted
To
make
another
attempt
at
it
Im
Infinite
Bust
it
I
let
the
beat
commence
So
I
can
beat
the
sense
in
your
elite
defense
I
got
some
meat
to
mince
A
crew
to
stomp
and
then
two
feet
to
rinse
I
greet
the
gents
and
ladies
I
spoil
loyal
fans
I
foil
plans
and
leave
fluids
leaking
like
oil
pans
My
coiled
hands
around
this
microphone
are
lethal
One
thought
in
my
cerebral
is
deeper
than
a
jeep-full
of
people
MCs
are
feeble
I
came
to
cause
some
pandemonium
Battle
a
band
of
phony
MCs
and
stand
the
lonely
one
Imitator
intimidator
stimulator
Simulator
of
data
eliminator
Theres
never
been
a
greater
since
the
burial
of
Jesus
Fuck
around
and
catch
all
the
venereal
diseases
My
thesisll
smash
a
stereo
to
pieces
My
a
cappella
releases
classic
masterpieces
Through
telekinesis
it
eases
you
mentally
Gently
sentimentally
instrumentally
With
entity
dementedly
meant
to
be
Infinite
Im
Infinite
you
heard
of
Hell
Well
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
Im
trying
to
repent
from
it
But
when
I
hear
the
beat
Im
tempted
To
make
another
attempt
at
it
Im
Infinite
Man
I
got
evidence
Im
never
dense
And
Ive
been
clever
ever
since
my
residence
was
hesitant
To
do
some
shit
that
represents
the
MO
So
Im
assuming
all
responsibility
Cause
theres
a
monster
will
in
me
That
always
wants
to
kill
MCs
Mic
nestler
slammin
like
a
wrestler
Here
to
make
a
mess
of
a
lyric
smuggling
embezzler
No
one
is
specialer
my
skill
is
intergalactical
I
get
cynical
act
a
fool
then
I
send
a
crew
back
to
school
I
never
packed
a
tool
or
acted
cool
it
wasnt
practical
Id
rather
let
a
tactical
tactful
track
tickle
your
fancy
In
fact
I
cant
see
or
cant
imagine
A
man
who
aint
a
lover
of
beats
or
a
fan
of
scratchin
So
this
is
for
my
family
the
kid
who
had
a
cameo
On
my
last
jam
plus
the
man
who
never
had
a
plan
B
Be
all
you
can
be
cause
once
you
make
an
instant
hit
Im
tensed
a
bit
and
tempted
When
I
see
the
sins
my
friends
commit
Im
Infinite
you
heard
of
Hell
Well
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
Im
trying
to
repent
from
it
But
when
I
hear
the
beat
Im
tempted
To
make
another
attempt
at
it
Im
Infinite

And
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
and
on
So
lets
get
down
to
business
I
dont
got
no
time
to
play
around
what
is
this
{scratching}
What
is
this
what
is
this
[Intro]
The

more
thing

[Verse:
Eminem]
Whoa
here
we
go
I
shoulda
known
I

pulled
into
some
bullshit
Sooner
or

You

percent
of

But

But
I
aint
trying
to
get
too
intricate
into
it
Im
just
trying
to
you
give
you
a
little
hint
for
your
own
benefit
Cause
then
its
gonna
get
to
the
point
Where
it
escalates
to
some
other
shit
Then
Im
a
flip
then
Im
a
get
to
Stomping
in
my
Air
Force
Ones
But
you
wont
be
able
to
tell
If

two
pairs
or
its
one
Its
just
gonna
feel
like
so
many
feet
kicking
you
Youd
think
Nike
just
made
these
into
cleats
in
this
shoe
I
dont
know
what
it
is
or
what
it
could
be
But
I
get
a
woody
when
these
pussies
try
to
push
me
Thinking
they
gonna
put
me
in
a
position
to
pickle
me
Yall

Pink

ShadyBitch
youre

just
like
that
Kim
lady
And
Im
in
sky
rock
radiothe
shadiest
bro
on
the
radio
But
you
dont
hear
me
tho
I’ve
always
looked
at
battle
rap
as
competition
or
war
and
the
main
objective
is
to
destroy
completely
fuckin
obliterate
your
opponent
by
saying
anything
and
everything
whatever
the
fuck
you
can
to
get
a
reaction
from
the
crowd
So
nothings
off
limits
I
need
you
to
spit
that
lyrical
miracle…
in
the
swimming
pool
Before
this
kicks
off
let
me
set
my
balls
in
this
tees
’Cause
Im
dottin
is
every
time
I
cross
one
of
these
Theres
not
a
redeeming
quality
at
all
in
me
Its
impossible
seems
like
an
implausible
dream
Positive
clean
thoughts
intervene
But
theyre
all
either
altered
and
mean
Assault
and
demean
tossed
and
theyre
being
lost
in
the
scheme
Squashed
in-between
a
brainwashing
machine
Like
an
Islamic
regime
a
jihadist
extreme
radical
Suicide
bomber
that’s
seeing
Ariana
Grande
sing
her
last
song
of
the
evening
And
as
the
audience
from
the
damn
concert
is
leaving
Detonates
the
device
strapped
to
his
abdominal
region
I’m
not
gonna
finish
that
for
obvious
reasons
But
bring
your
dogs
Ima
muzzle
’em
Im
not
Middle
Eastern
but
Ill
make
a
bitch
Raqqa
hijab
And
at
least
a
extra
large
in
the
T-shirt
Headscarf
and
a
piece
of
tarp
underneath
the
carpet
hasta
la
vista
I
go
Hamas
on
the
beats
to
a
paradox
on
the
beach
And
a
pair
of
crotchless
underwear
on
a
terrorist
watch
list
Gettin
head
in
the
sand
like
an
embarrassed
ostrich
Professional
shit
sprayer
Bitch
watch
who
you
talkin’
to
like
Apple
wristwear
Endangered
species
in
this
ABC
shit
a
bit
scarce
Preys
decreasing
I
face
extinction
like
disc
players
Told
this
chick
shes
hot
as
Jada
Pinkett
And
just
stared
til
I
made
her
think
it
Said
Maybe
we
should
just
get
married
Shes
facing
me
I
placed
my
feet
with
my
hips
square
Tell
her
Turn
around
spread
her
legs
for
me
then
I
hit
bare
Leave
her
stretched
out
like
a
baby
T-shirt
on
Ric
Flair
As
I
ripped
her
anal
beads
in
a
split
rear
Spray
Febreze
in
the
chicks
hair
Make
her
wheeze
tryna
get
air
I
played
for
keeps
theres
no
escaping
me
I
have
a
bitch
scared
And
chained
to
me
and
throw
away
the
key
And
shell
be
so
afraid
to
leave
That
even
if
she
ends
up
breaking
free
shell
just
sit
there
Tryin
to
scrape
up
enough
courage
and
strength
to
get
up
Its
impossible
like
rapin
a
slut
We
stay
butt-naked
and
fuck
Youre
close
wait
for
you
what
My
idea
you
comin
too
its
waking
you
up
With
smelling
salts
after
I
Quaalude
your
cup
Thatll
straighten
you
up
if
you
try
to
stray
like
a
pup
Hate
to
get
bogged
down
in
details
But
bitch
Im
like
the
dog
pound
with
females
My
brain
is
corrupt
real
life
Hillside
Strangler
I
strangle
a
skanks
neck
til
its
triangular
Shape
but
its
upside
down
and
my
mouth
aint
gonna
shut
And
mention
me
in
your
raps
if
it
makes
you
a
buck
Or
helps
you
rake
in
the
duckets
I
want
payment
in
pub
Cause
I
aint
tryna
get
in
your
bars
like
Im
waiting
the
club
But
if
you
put
me
in
your
lines
Im
takin
a
cut
Get
a
million
writers
inside
of
a
room
combined
in
it
Try
to
get
every
idea
of
every
possible
line
to
spit
Every
punchline
every
combination
that
rhymes
with
it
Bitch
a
whole
team
cant
see
me
theres
no
Is
in
it
Head
so
big
I
shot
myself
ten
times
in
it
Tryna
commit
suicide
in
it
took
five
minutes
And
I
survived
this
shit
Someones
gonna
challenge
me
who
Battle
me
and
win
thats
a
fucking
fallacy
too
You
name
one
motherfucker
in
this
galaxy
spits
reality
You
fantasy
rally
your
troops
try
to
boost
the
morale
Only
time
I
start
a
movements
a
bowel
I
cant
even
give
a
yeah
or
a
woo
when
you
rap
in
the
booth
Not
even
a
nah
or
a
boo
Cause
even
though
Im
allergic
to
the
crap
that
you
spew
When
Im
bout
to
break
out
I
dont
mean
get
a
rash
from
it
too
Cause
when
I
say
I
have
allergies
I
actually
do
But
thats
just
an
analogy
Ive
never
had
a
reaction
to
you
Creature
from
the
Black
Lagoon
I
reach
up
and
I
smack
the
moon
Youre
grief
struck
that
Im
back
so
soon
Your
teacher
for
this
afternoon
Creep
up
with
a
pack
of
hoodlums
We
pack
a
punch
like
Capri
Sun
Heat
tucked
like
we
each
snuck
in
a
submachine
gun
We
stuck
in
a
submarine
bun
with
a
bag
of
shrooms
Cup
of
lean
up
in
the
padded
room
Justin
Bieber
in
a
Catholic
school
Selling
dust
and
reefer
when
your
back
is
to
him
Dont
adjust
your
speaker
Ill
cuss
the
stripes
off
of
a
fuckin
zebra
when
Im
at
the
zoo
Huffin
cleaner
til
I
gag
from
fumes
Fuck
Christina
with
a
plastic
spoon
While
I
bump
some
G-Funk
and
blast
some
Snoop
Cause
her
double
g-cups
are
massive
huge
Its
fun
for
me
just
to
grab
a
boob
Plus
my
penis
got
an
attitude
My
fuckin
Weiners
in
a
combative
mood
Come
and
suck
a
mean
one
like
its
mad
at
you
I
speak
tongue-in-cheek
what
you
asslicks
do
Cause
you
love
to
eat
butt
its
sad
but
true
I
just
sprung
a
leak
suddenly
What
I
think
in
my
gut
instinct
become
in
sync
My
thoughts
and
my
stomach
link
up
with
each
other
Ink
touches
the
pad
then
boom
Since
the
day
Dre
gave
me
beats
I
was
made
elite
Thats
basically
what
makes
me
me
Creating
stink
til
these
tats
are
fading
ink
Whos
the
greatest
Think
were
still
debating
wink
ADD
and
better
put
out
an
APB
Cause
itll
take
LAPD
and
me
layin
in
the
street
For
you
to
see
Shady
beat
And
Ill
bet
ya
theyd
need
cleats
Cause
Id
have
to
be
stomped
by
forty
men
to
suffer
a
defeat
I
pray
please
Jesus
to
make
me
decent
Inhaling
the
main
ingredient
of
pain
relievers
and
saline
I
take
three
Aleves
tryna
break
these
fevers
Im
ailing
I
stay
free
of
divas
and
ladies
screamin
Cause
they
keep
schemin
on
me
Vading
keepin
the
women
at
bay
Like
Laci
Peterson
baby
fetuses
Legs
and
feet
have
been
weighted
chained
in
semen
Its
straight
demon—and
wait
Even
if
it
takes
meat
cleavers
to
make
believers
Mistake-free
schemes
are
enablin
me
to
remain
deviant
Breakbeat
eat
her
like
steak
meat
Emcees
take
seats
like
AMC
theaters
Deranged
ringleader
depraved
king
Who
mainstream
media
hates
Which
makes
things
easier
still
under
scrutiny
Villainous
smooth
criminal
livin
room
With
the
nude
Reese
Witherspoon
Who
was
bruised
beat
with
a
broom
Its
in
two
pieces
and
lays
deceased
in
it
Bit
with
a
chewed
leash
and
his
chain-link
leapin
it
Live
in
the
booth
shave
eat
bathe
drink
sleep
in
it
R-A-P
bleed
the
shit
still
and
I
poop
pee
it
Its
a
spillage
a
sewage
leak
waste
deep
feces
The
syllables
ooze
fecal
they
feel
like
renewed
leases
Cause
my
brain
releases
em
Like
waste
excretion
its
simultaneously
As
Im
givin
these
fools
grief
theyre
feelin
the
blues
Cause
even
if
stealin
my
shoes
thieves
Just
to
fill
ems
a
huge
feat
A
hill
and
its
too
steep
Obey
these
demons
were
still
in
cahoots
Keep
feedin
me
blank
sheets
As
soon
as
I
sink
these
teeth
And
Im
killin
the
loose
leaf
Time
to
shake
these
trees
again
Wait
make
that
phrase
repeat
again
Killin
the
loose
leaf
shake
these
trees
again
Get
the
rake
but
it
aint
me
leavin
em
Vicodins
new
prints
I
bite
them
and
chew
them
The
whites
and
the
blues
mixed
with
nitrus
balloons
And
I
like
to
sniff
gluesticks
put
Ricin
on
toothpicks
On
the
mic
Im
just
ruthless
a
crisis
a
nuisance
Who
I
influence
I
give
two
shits
If
they
wanna
license
my
music
to
entice
with
Then
use
the
shit
like
its
the
blueprint
for
ISIS
recruitment
Excuse
me
while
I
stare
into
space
for
a
few
In
a
daze
or
haze
glazed
over
crazed
warp
loon
Mental
cased
off
always
had
a
straight-forward
view
But
you
bozos
keep
givin
the
flamethrower
fuel
No
ones
ever
sank
lower
shrewd
and
way
more
rude
Beast-mode
like
a
lawn-mower
blade
rolled
thru
it
And
this
has
little
to
do
with
bein
gay
boy
Its
just
where
the
wordplays
goin
But
aint
much
I
can
say
or
do
Cause
aint
no
excuse
the
way
I
go
at
you
faggot
You
say
Im
always
screw-faced
So
if
I
look
your
way
youre
screwed
Cause
if
looks
could
kill
I
could
start
a
hate-war
too
Cause
Id
murder
you
straight
bitches
by
turnin
the
gaze
on
you
Lets
take
it
back
before
the
tightly-worn
pants
To
the
Nike
Jordan
hats
The
stripe
Lees
Jordache
and
the
white
tees
Lightning
storms
might
be
formed
fast
Such
a
frightening
forecast
But
when
youre
slightly
hoarse
rasp
From
the
cyphering
or-gasp
but
still
reciting
your
raps
While
youre
tightening
your
grasp
around
the
mic
cause
you
done
shitted
on
it
so
much
youre
always
reminded
of
your
past
Cause
your
heinys
sore
thats
Cause
you
still
havent
finished
fuckin
wiping
your
ass
From
the
night
before
last
No
good
but
rap
somethin
Im
too-good-for-my-own-good
at
Fuck
adulthood
Im
a
grown-up
brat
Where
your
cojones
at
Mine
are
always
being
rode
in
fact:
Theyre
frozen
you
ever
seen
a
cul-de-sac
So
big
they
fell
out
my
scrotum
I
just
sowed
em
back
Dick
so
long
need
a
shoulder-strap
For
that
gotta
unroll
it
and
fold
it
back
So
difficult
to
wrap
in
the
pro-filactic
it
overlaps
it
So
I
pack
a
Trojan
so
fat
when
I
lay
it
flat
its
like
a
yoga
mat
Make
a
bitch
think
shes
in
aerobics
class
The
bear
you
dont
wanna
poke
its
back
The
backbone
of
rap
your
fuckin
lead
singles
are
my
bonus
tracks
When
I
appear
my
peers
stop
Hearts
fall
in
their
stomach
their
spirits
drop
Careers
flop
their
gears
lock
severe
shock
Fear
at
the
mere
thought
Lyrics

top-tier
Im
so
high
at
the
top
Im
in
the
sky

AutoTune

mumble
rap
mouth
Need

get
the
cock

before
we
can
even
talk
about

talk

Im
sick
of
your
blonde
hair
and
earrings
Just
cause
you
look
in
the
mirror
and
think
youre
Marshall
Mathers
Marshall
Mathers
Dont

youre
not

So

You

And
Im
just
playin
Diddy
you
know
I
love
you
Here
to
stay
Even
when
Im
gone
When
I
close
my
eyes
Through
the
passage
of
time
Kings
never
die
I
can
hear
the
drummers
drumming
And
the
trumpets
someones
tryna
summon
someone
I
know
somethings
coming
But
Im
running
from
it
to
be
standing
at
the
summit
And
plummet
how
come
it
wasnt
what
I
thought
it
was
Was
it
too
good
to
be
true
Have
nothing
get
it
all
but
too
much
of
it
Then
lose
it
again
then
I
swallow
hallucinogens
Cause
if
not
where
the
hell
did
it
go
Cause
here
I
sit
in
Lucifers
den
by
the
dutch
oven
Just
choosing
to
sin
Even
if
it
means
Im
selling
my
soul
just
to
be
the
undisputed
again
Do
whatever
I
gotta
do
this
to
win
Cause
I
got
this
motherfucking
cloud
over
my
head
Crown
around
it
thorns
on
it
Cracks
in
it
bet
you
morons
didnt
Think
Id
be
back
did
ya
How
bout
that
Im
somehow
now
back
to
the
underdog
But
no
matter
how
loud
that
I
bark
this
sport
is
something
I
never
bow-wowd
at
I
complain
about
the
game
I
shout
and
I
pout
its
a
love-hate
But
I
found
out
that
I
can
move
a
mountain
of
doubt
Even
when
you
bitches
are
counting
me
out
and
I
appear
to
be
down
for
the
count
Only
time
I
ever
been
out
and
about
is
driving
around
town
with
my
fucking
whereabouts
in
a
doubt
cause
I
been
lost
tryna
think
of
what
I
did
to
get
here
but
Im
not
a
quitter
Gotta
get
up
give
it
all
I
got
or
give
up
Spit
or
shit
or
stepped
on
but
kept
going
Im
tryna
be
headstrong
but
it
feels
like
I
slept
on
my
neck
wrong
Cause
youre
moving
onto
the
next
but
is
the
respect
gone
Cause
someone
told
me
that
Kings
never
die
Dont
give
me
that
sob
story
liar
dont
preach
to
the
choir
You
aint
ever
have
to
reach
in
the
fire
to
dig
deep
Nobody
ever
handed
me
shit
in
life
not
even
a
flyer
Wouldnt
even
take
shit
into
consideration
Obliterate
anyone
in
the
way
I
think
I
see
why
a
lot
of
rappers
get
on
these
features
and
try
to
show
out
on
a
track
with
me
But
itd
actually
have
to
be
a
fucking
blowout
to
get
me
to
retire
Tell
these
new
artists
that
kings
never
die
I
know
shit
has
changed
in
this
age
fuck
a
Twitter
page
did
just
say
Ive
been
upstaged
Why
am
I
online
Its
driving
me
crazy
Im
riding
shotgun
tryna
get
a
gauge
Almost
hot
but
Im
not
running
kaboom
with
a
stage
pass
and
this
shit
And
opinions
sway
I
can
hear
them
say
if
I
stay
passionate
maybe
I
can
stay
Jay
miraculous
Comeback
as
if
I
went
away
but
detractors
just
say
some
bullshit
for
the
Renegade
Someones
gonna
make
me
blow
my
composure
Here
I
go
again
to
the
stage
and
I
feel
like
Im
in
a
cage
They
so
want
a
champion
to
fall
I
still
wonder
why
I
laugh
at
em
cause
why
carry
when
Im
all
So
fuck
what
these
cynics
say
Just
goes
to
show
that
when
my
backs
against
the
wall
And
Im
under
attack
again
Ill
act
as
if
Im
posted
up
With
this
pented
rage
cause
saw
all
these
plaques
in
my
office
On
the
floor
stacked
against
the
door
All
be
just
metaphors
for
the
odds
of
When
you
comin
back
again
cause
all
the
accomplishments
accolades
awards
And
trophies
just
dont
mean
jack
anymore
Cause
Im
here
today
and
gone
tomorrow
And
Im
not
gonna
be
Here
to
stay
Even
when
Im
gone
When
I
close
my
eyes
Through
the
passage
of
time
Kings
never
die
I
want
it
Im
coming
to
get
it
so
you
son
of
a
bitches
dont
duck
your
gun
and
get
rid
of
those
Critics
all
end
up
in
critical
think
your
shit
is
dope
all
youre
gonna
get
is
smoked
then
And
Im
not
stopping
until
Im
top
again
all
alone
and
on
a
throne
Like
a
token
of
respect
or
a
homage
poem
or
an
ode
Ive
been
on
Tossed
in
the
air
by
my
own
arm
and
launched
so
hard
I
broke
my
collarbone
And
its
my
time
to
go
but
Im
still
not
leaving
Stop
for
no
one
I
dont
know
but
Ive
been
told
that
I
should
go
Launch
a
Rover
knock
it
over
time
to
go
for
that
pot
of
gold
cause
They
say
kings
never
die
Just
ask
Jam
Master
Jay
They
just
grow
wings
and
they
fly
So
hands
up
reach
for
the
sky
Try
to
hold
up
and
provoke
these
moments
Cause
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
Theyll
be
over
Tryna
secure
your
legacy
like
Shakur
And
ensure
that
nobodys
ever
gonna
be
what
you
were
So
before
youre
leaving
this
Earth
You
want
people
to
feel
the
fury
of
a
pure
evil
cerebral
berzerk
Deacon
of
words
syllable
genius
at
work
Plus
Im
think
that
theyre
mistaking
my
kindness
for
weakness
distill
it
with
meanness
With
some
kind
of
back
flipping
burgers
on
the
grill
for
some
peanuts
Secure
us
to
arenas
call
me
Gilbert
Arenas
still
appeal
to
the
dreamers
I
made
it
to
the
silverscreen
where
Rocky
stepped
with
the
demons
Khalil
on
the
beat
cause
making
the
beat
aint
the
same
feeling
to
me
is
killing
the
beat
Its
fulfilling
to
me
what
filling
a
seat
is
That
sound
vomit
thirst
and
how
common
underground
commons
eat
Outsider
stomach
growl
throbbing
hunger
Out-rhyming
everyone
God
just
give
me
one
shot
I
swear
that
I
wont
let
you
down
Imma
be
around
forever
entertain
even
in
the
ground
You
aint
ever
gonna
hear
me
say
I
aint
Here
to
stay
Even
when
Im
gone
When
I
close
my
eyes
Through
the
passage
of
time
Kings
never
die
Oh

Oh
oh

Brain

Dip

The

prime
suspect
But
I
aint
set
to
flee
the
scene
of
the
crime
just
yet
Cuz
I
got
a
daughter
to
feed
And
$200
aint
enough
to
water
the
seed
The
best
thing
would
be
for
me
to
leave
Taco
Bell
an
hit
up
Chess
King
And
have
the
lady
at
the
desk
bring
Money
from

Mac
Cooperate

This

tried
escapin
the
jack
Grabbed
her
by
the
throat
its
murder
she
wrote
You
barely
heard

as
she
choked
It
wasnt
nuttin
for
her
to
be
smoked
But
I
slammed
her
on
her
back
til
her
vertebrae
broke
Just
then
the

Freeze
But
Im
already
wanted
for
sellin
keys
And
bunch
of
other
felonies
from
A

So
before
I
dropped
to
the
ground
and
fell
on
knees
I

Hit

Parents

Tell

Tried

to
let

leap
up
Run
in
they
crib
and
at
least
leave
with
some
little
cheap
stuff
Actin
like

nobody
hit
a
nick
before
Smashed
the
window
grabbed
the
Nintendo
64
When
they
sell
out
in
stores
the
price
triples
I
ran
up
the
block
jumpin
kids
on
tricycles
And
colliding
with
an
80-year
old
lady
with
groceries
There
goes
the
cheese
eggs
milk
and
Post
Toasties
Stood
up
and
started
to
see
stars
Too
many
siren
sounds
it
seemed
like
a
thousand
police
cars
Barely
escaped
must-a
been
some
dumb
luck
Jumped
up
and
climbed
the
back
of
a
movin
dump
truck
But
I
think
somebody
seen
me
maybe
Plus
I
lost
the
damn
Nintendo
and
I
must-a
dropped
the
Beanie
Baby
Fuck

Came

stack
of

Walked

up
Flashed
the
bartender
then
stuck
my
dick
in
the
tip
cup
Extraterrestrial
running
over
pedestrians
in
a

While

I
knocked
her
clothes

Kris
Kross
I
smoke
a
fat
pound
of
grass

Faster

Chased

with
a
stapler
stapled
his
nuts
to
a
stack
of
papers
Walked
in
the
strip
club
had
my
jacket
zipped
up
Flashed
the
bartender
then
stuck
my
dick
in
the
tip
cup
Extraterrestrial
running
over
pedestrians
in
a
spaceship
While

Lets

You

Usher

Old

heart
attacks
and
I

to
be
responsible
for
that
so
Put

walk
away
You

of
dignity

Sweets

Married

Thats

full
of
broken
bottles
And
my
night
stands
are
full
of
open
Bibles
I
think
about
more
than

But
I
dont
go
around
fire
expecting
not
to

And
these

Bitches

All

[Hook
-
Eminem
&
Lil

[Verse

-
Eminem]
Im
alive
again
More
alive
than
I
have
been
in
my
whole
entire
life
I
can
see
these
peoples
ears
perk
up
as
I
begin
To
spaz
with
the
pen
Im
a
little
bit
sicker
than
most
Shits
finna
get
thick
again
They
say
the
competition
is
stiff
But
I
get
a
hard
dick
from
this
shit
now
stick
it
in
I
aint
never
giving
in
again
Cuss
into
the
wind
complete
freedom
Look
at
these
rappers
how
I
treat
them
So
why
the
fuck
would
I
join
them
when
I
beat
them
They
call
me
a
freak
because
I
like
to
spit
on
these
pussies
fore
I
eat
them
Man
get
these
whack
cocksuckers
off
stage
Where
the
fuck
is
Kanye
when
you
need
him
Snatch
the
mic
from
him
bitch
Imma
let
you
finish
in
a
minute
Yeah
the
rap
is
tight
But
Im
fucking
with
the
greatest
verse
of
all
time
So
you
might
want
to
go
back
to
the
lab
tonight
and
um
Scribble
out
them
rhymes
you
were
going
to
spit
And
start
over
from
scratch
and
write
new
ones
But
Im
afraid
that
it
aint
gonna
make
no
difference
When
I
rip
this
stage
and
tear
it
in
half
tonight
Its
an
adrenaline
rush
to
feel
the
bass
thump
In
the
place
all
the
way
to
the
parking
lot
fellow
Set
fire
to
the
mic
and
ignite
the
crowd
You
can
see
the
sparks
from
hot
metal
Cold-hearted
from
the
day
I
Bogarted
the
game
I
so
started
to
rock
fellow
When
Im
not
even
in
my
harshest
You
can
still
get
roasted
because
Marsh
is
not
mellow
Til
Im
toppling
from
the
top
Im
not
going
to
stop
Im
standing
on
my
Monopoly
board
That
means
Im
on
top
of
my
game
and
it
dont
stop
Til
my
hip
dont
hop
anymore
When
you
so
good
that
you
cant
say
it
Because
it
aint
even
cool
for
you
to
sound
cocky
anymore
People
just
get
sick
cause
you
spit
These
fools
cant
drool
or
dribble
a
drop
anymore
And
you
can
never
break
my
stride
You
never
slow
the
momentum
at
any
moment
Im
about
to
blow
Youll
never
take
my
pride
Killing
the
flow
slow
venom
and
the
opponent
Is
getting
no
mercy
mark
my
words
Aint
letting
up
relentless
I
smell
blood
I
dont
give
a
fuck:
keep
giving
them
hell
Where
was
you
when
I
fell
and
needed
help
up
You
get
no
love
Grazie

Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
worlds
on
fire
but
we
dont
care
yeah
Wasted
youth
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
were
never
getting
old
Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
youre
told
Were
going
nowhere
fast
I
feel
sorry
for
this
beat
Sympathy
pains
for
this
track
This
road
is
taking
me
back
Down
memory
lane
with
this
rap
I
can
still
look
out
in
this
crowd
Be
wowed
and
be
taken
aback
Im
simply
stating
a
fact
I
had
Wembley
Stadium
packed
But
now
were
on
a
path
headed
to
nowhere
and
fast
Another
terrorist
attack
like
a
tariff
grows
Half
of
Madison
Square
up
alas
We
perish
in
the
blast
but
that
doesnt
scare
us
We
pass
no
one
were
fearless
Cause
were
just
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
worlds
on
fire
but
we
dont
care
yeah
Wasted
youth
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
were
never
getting
old
Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
youre
told
Were
going
nowhere
fast
Cause
were
going
no
going
no
Going
no
going
no
Going
no
going
nowhere
Going
nowhere
fast
Fuck
doing
what
youre
told
act
like
a
two-year
old
Shit
is
soon
to
go
kaboom
and
blow
anyways
For
MCs
its
a
funeral
when
Im
devising
this
rhyme
Cause
Im
awake
and
youre
mourning
Thats
why
I
rise
and
I
shine
Like
a
new
day
has
dawned
on
me
Gusto
guts
bravado
nuts
and
plus
I
kick
up
dust
and
cuss
a
lot
I
musta
got
you
in
somewhat
of
a
debacle
Cause
some
stuff
thats
awful
really
dont
mean
nothing
all
though
Theres
a
lot
of
shit
I
said
in
jest
thats
tough
to
swallow
But
if
at
times
my
heart
it
seems
like
its
in
the
wrong
place
Its
probably
cause
its
on
my
sleeve

Were

Where

have
no
idea
Nowhere
to
go
but
hysterical
Its
getting
warm
in
here
I
set
the
world
on

Was
born
to
be
an
arsonist
Just

spark
and

lit
But
Ima
still
get
dark
on
this
shit
Told
you
Id
leave
my
mark
on
this
bitch
War
machine
but
youve
forced
me
in
a
corner
Im
sure
to
have
something
for
your
ear
And
in
the
course
of
the
assault
is
torture
its
more
severe
Go
to
war
with
me
or
end
up
blew
to
Timbuktu
I
send
at
you
a
ten
ton
nuke
like
Kim
Jong-Un
And
end
up
blewn
in
your
career
All
in
all
its
said
and
done
And
at
the
end
of
my
run
I
just
rewind
clocks
Forever
young
make
time
stop
Will
I
ever
fall
off
that
dayll
never
come
To
the
Pine
box

Til

Worlds

lyrics
[Intro]
Oh

whats
happening
to
my
brain
I
cant
believe
this
is
happening
again
[Verse
1]
Lava
out
my
lips
I
flips
Wake
up
think
I
have
a
cramp
Im
trying
to
shove
the
lava
lamp
up
my
fathers
ass
I
think
Im
out
of
gas
man
I
think
I
need
another
mask
Id
ask
my
mother
but
I
think
shes
laughing
at
the
plants
A
half
a
gram
of
graham
crackers
and
some
Van
de
Kamps
I
think
Ill
eat
some
Ambiens
like
theyre
candied
yams
Cut
a
couple
cadavers
up
and
have
a
little
snack
Abraf-ckingcadabra
motherf-cker
look
whos
back
Just
like
a
pendulum
Satans
pentagram
swings
I
accidentally
dented
it
and
bent
the
damn
thing
Shit
I
think
I
might
have
did
it
when
I
was
dancing
While
I
was
chopping
one
of
my
legs
off
and
pulled
a
hamstring
First
I
Re-up
then
I
Relapse
Go
to
rehab
then
I
Detox
after
I
see
Doc
And
Ill
be
back
with
the
sequel
repeat
the
cycle
Cause
I
react
like
the
She-Hulk
when
I
see
Nyquil
[Hook]
Oh
no
Here
we
go
again
When
its
going
to
end
Where
did
it
begin
Maybe
way
back
when
[Verse
2]
Into
the
well
baby
Jessica
fell
She
may
have
wetted
herself
Quit
playing
get
her
some
help
Mary
Kay
Letourneau
sending
me
letters
from
jail
Every
day
in
journals
saying
how
She
wanted
to
smother
me
in
lettuce
and
mayo
Im
the
medicine
man
My
medical
marijuana
was
prescribed
by
a
doctor
Shove
a
typewriter
up
her
Perez
Hiltons
ass
shit
almost
forgot
that
Hes
always
shoving
something
up
his
ass
so
why
not
that
And
f-ck
it
while
Im
venting
lets
shove
a
vending
machine
Up
his
rear
end
when
hes
bending
over
pretending
that
he
Didnt
say
anything
that
would
be
offending
to
me
Stick
his
head
in
a
blender
begin
blending
in
G
Where
should
I
put
the
pink
sissy
with
the
fluffy
hair
Put
him
under
the
stairs
People
are
already
under
there
Hmm
I
wonder
where
Wait
I
think
the
cubpoards
bare
Stuff
him
up
in
the
tupperware
and
shove
him
up
in
there
[Hook]
[Verse
3]
Vicodins
like
a
nitrogen
hydrogen
vitamin
I
bite
into
five
and
then
I
get
high
as
a
kite
again
I
like
it
when
I
get
in
my
zone
on
the
mic
again
Who
am
I
kidding
I
couldnt
quit
this
shit
if
my
life
depends
I
relapsed
twice
after
I
came
outta
Brighton
then
Yeah
rehabs
nice
I
had
my
name
up
in
lights
again
You
see
thats
why
I
cant
decipher
what
life
Im
in
I
might
pull
a
knife
on
your
wife
and
slice
her
and
dice
her
then
It
sounds
so
enticing
isnt
it
nice
when
Im
hype
again
Im
nice
when
Im
like
this
no
time
to
write
just
type
it
in
If
I
could
get
my
pen
to
slow
down
whatd
I
write
just
then
Man
Im
about
to
hyperventilate
I
just
have
hyper-tension
I
have
the
type
of
mental
state
you
couldnt
comprehend
Unusually
stupid
of
you
for
you
to
think
Im
your
friend
I
usually
do
what
I
do
and
suffer
no
consequence
I
offer
no
mercy
the
controversy
is
once
again
[Hook]
Paroles
de
la
chanson
Phenomenal
par
Eminem
I

However

that
it
takes
Ill
go
to
whatever
rates
Its
gonna
make
me
a

But
I
would
never
say
‘Oh

impossible’
Cause
Im
gonna
be
phenomenal
Unstoppable

Who

There

no
situation
that
you

had
to
respond
to

adverse
The
messiest
thing

ever
gone
through
is
your
purse
Yeah
I
dont
try
like
Captain
I
might
as
well
Hang
it
up
like
a
shelf
gotta
keep
growin
with
it
evolve
Cause
you
can
keep
throwin
shit
at
the
wall
But
youre
gonna
find
that
nothings
gonna
stick
until
you
apply
yourself
Time
to
slip
in
that
zone
till
I
find
myself
Inside
the
realm
where
the
unknown
and
boldly
go
In
the
waters
where
nobody
else
has
gone
before
Or
willing
to
go
uncharted
feeling
is
so
Bomb
Im
feelin
myself
Im
a
giant
Sometimes
I
gotta
remind
myself
that
I
am
I
am
phenomenal
With
every
ounce
of
my
blood
With
every
breath
in
my
lungs
Wont
stop
until
Im
phe-no-menal
I
am
phenomenal
However
long
that
it
takes
Ill
go
to
whatever
rates
Its
gonna
make
me
a
monster
though
I
am
phenomenal
But
I
would
never
say
‘Oh
it’s
impossible’
Cause
Im
gonna
be
phenomenal
Let
me
self-empower
you
When
youre
down
and
theyre
tryin
to
clown
the
fuck
out
of
you
When
you
feel
like
youre
runnin
out
of
fuel
Ill
show
you
how
to
use
doubt
as
fuel
Convert
it
to
gunpowder
too
Now
what
you
do
is
put
the
match
to
the
charcoal
fluid
Put
a
spark
to
it
like
Martha
Stewart
barbecuing
Ah
screw
it
feel
like
you
want
to
hit
that
wall
then
do
it
Punch
through
it
just
cock
back
put
your
all
into
it
Now
you
gon
take
that
rage
and
make
that
what
you
raise
Never
take
back
what
you
say
If
you
stay
trapped
in
your
brain
engage
in
this
fueled
cage
match
Ready
to
scrap
asap
Take
your
fists
to
his
bones
Show
Biggie
whos
smallest
youre
Christopher
Wallace
Yeah
I
picture
em
all
as
plastic
and
foam
Lays
flat
where
you
put
your
dinner
plates
at
And
set
it
off
like
a
placemat
I
am
phenomenal
And
I
want
you
to
say
that
I
am
phenomenal
With
every
ounce
of
my
blood
With
every
breath
in
my
lungs
Wont
stop
until
Im
phe-no-menal
I
am
phenomenal
However
long
that
it
takes
Ill
go
to
whatever
rates
Its
gonna
make
me
a
monster
though
I
am
phenomenal
But
I
would
never
say
‘Oh
it’s
impossible’
Cause
Im
gonna
be
phenomenal
Said
I
need
you
to
make
a
note
And
find
yourself
your
glory
free
your
person
Is
that
a
fuckin’
mouth
with
no
shut-up
valve
Cant
even
cut
the
power
to
it
when
its
what
allowed
Me
to
come
up
out
from
under
the
fuckin
ground
Cause
I
worked
my
butt
off
now
Its
a
subject
I
dont
know
how
to
shut
up
about
Cause
I
stuck
it
out
Like
a
mothafuckin
tongue
to
tie
I
responded
when
I
got
shoved
around
Youre
gonna
have
down
believers
But
when
youre
beyond
belief
you
probably
shouldnt
wonder
how
Get
it
how
you
live
But
are
you
prepared
to
give
more
than
you
get
And
put
in
twice
what
you
get
back
from
this
shit
Though
what
you
sacrifice
barely
is
half
never
give
Rap
is
my
shift
But
its
like
my
shield
at
the
same
time
I
wield
Ima
knife
this
will
Sometimes
I
feel
just
like
B
Real
from
Cypress
Hill
How
I
can
just
kill
a
cypher
survivors
guilt
I
rhyme
like
life
is
still
an
uphill
climb
Ready
to
face
it
each
challenge
waitin
Taste
it
its
salivation
Im
wagin
retaliation
Look
what
I
have
built
reputation
is
delegation
The
only
thing
Im
capable
of
makin
is
amazing
Only
thing
youre
capable
of
makin
is
a
false
statement
An
accusation
I
am
legendary
status
in
fact
That
is
the
only
way
youll
ever
be
able
to
say
Your
legend
is
makin
an
allegation
I
write
with
the
left
same
hand
I
hold
the
mic
with
As
I
fight
to
the
death
til
my
last
breath
Managed
to
prove
who
the
best
man
is
Surveil
it
all
cards
be
the
only
ones
left
standing
In
the
end
but
I
aint
gonna
be
the
only
one
with
the
advantage
Of
knowing
what
its
like
to
be
southpaw
Cause
you
can
bet
your
ass
youll
be
left
handed
I
am
phenomenal
With
every
ounce
of
my
blood
With
every
breath
in
my
lungs
Wont
stop
until
Im
phe-no-menal
I
am
phenomenal
However
long
that
it
takes
Ill
go
to
whatever
rates
Its
gonna
make
me
a
monster
though
I
am
phenomenal
But
I
would
never
say
‘Oh
it’s
impossible’
Cause
Im
gonna
be
phenomenal
[Eminem]
Yo
I
dedicate
to
this
to
yo
{imitating
Slick
Rick}
To
all
my
fans
keepin
yall
in
health
Lets
tell
this
Whitey
Ford
to
go
fuck
himself
Cause
its
cruel
when
you
cause
a
bad
heart
conditionin
which
I
create
cause
thats
my
mission
So
listen
close
to
what
we
say
because
this
type
of
fag
claims
to
never
be
gay
I
{rapping
normally}

knew
you
was
jealous
from
the
day
that
I
met
you
I
upset
you
cause
I
get
respect
I
pet
you
boy
Im
even
liked
better
by
your
niece
and
nephew
cmon
And
now
you
hate
Fred
because
Lethal
left
you
Peckerwood
mad
cause
his
record
went
wood
No
respect
in
the
hood
fled
to
his
neck
of
the
woods
Got
in
touch
with
his
roots
found
the
redneck
in
his
blood
and
said
Heck
country
western
rap
records
are
good
So
he
picks
the
guitar
up
and
he
strums
a
few
notes
He
cant
rap
or
sing
but
he
wants
to
do
both
haha
Puts
an
album
out
and
rules
for
part
of
the
year
then
Kid
Rock
and
Limp
Bizkit
come
from
out
of
nowhere
Its
the
start
of
an
era
rock
raps
harder
this
year
No
ones
tryin
to
hear
some
fuckin
old
fart
in
a
chair
sittin
on
stage
strummin
acoustic
guitar
in
your
ear
So
you
start
to
get
scared
sit
back
and
spark
an
idea
Figure
you
can
diss
me
to
jump
start
your
career
I
punch
you
in
your
fuckin
chest
til
your
heart
kicks
in
gear
bitch
And
fuck
your
underground
buddys
nameless
crew
Like
Ima
say
they
names
so
they
can
be
famous
too
[Chorus
2X:
Eminem
sung]
You
just
a
quitter
and
you
bitter
cause
I
came
along
and
the
days
of
House
of
Pain
are
gone
And
if
you
talk
about
my
little
girl
in
a
song
again
Ima
kill
you
Ima
kill
you
[Eminem]
Yo
heart
attack
to
stroke
from
the
crack
you
smoke
to
the
rap
you
wrote
your
fuckin
answer
backs
a
joke
And
Ima
tell
these
motherfuckin
fans
the
truth
The
reason
why
you
dissed
me
first
and
I
answered
you
You
said
I
passed
you
in
a
lobby
and
I
glanced
at
you
like
I
aint
notice
youBITCH
I
had
a
show
to
do
Like
Im
supposed
to
be
star-struck
come
over
to
you
You
better
shut
your
fuckin
mouth
while
you
oh-for-two
Back
in
ninety-four
Limp
opened
the
show
for
you
Rocked
the
crowd
better
and
stole
the
whole
show
from
you
Took
your
motherfuckin
DJ
and
stole
him
too
So
you
fall
in
a
slump
and
get
all
emotional
So
now
you
sing
and
mix
slang
with
blues
and
pluck
strings
Confused
as
fuck
cause
now
your
music
sucks
dick
Mr
Mr
Ass
Kisser
to
get
accepted
in
rap
quicker
but
never
last
and
Everlast

[Chorus]

feat
Dr
Dre
50
Cent
Jay-Z
Cashis
Stat
Quo
Its
not
about
lyrics
anymore
its
about
a
hot
beat
and
a
catchy
hook
[Eminem]
If
we
gotta
dumb
down
our
style
and
ABC
it
Then
so
be
it
Cause
nowadays
these
kids
jeez
Dont
give
a
shit
bout
lyrics
All
they
wanna
hear
is
a
beat
and
thats
it
Long
as
they
can
go
to
the
club
and
get
blitz
Pick
up
some
chicks
and
get
some
digits
And
the
DJs
playing
them
hits
Oh
this
my
jam
this
my
shit
We
dont
know
a
word
to
a
verse
All
we
know
is
the
chorus
Cause
the
chorus
repeats
the
same
four
words
for
us
And
the
songs
ginormous
the
whole
formulas
switched
Cause
we
dont
know
anymore
what
are
hits
Is
it
the
beat
is
it
the
rap
Is
it
a
finger
snap
or
the
same
808
clap
And
how
do
we
adapt
and
get
TRL
votes
When
13
year
olds
control
the
remote
And
Ashleys
got
a
brand
new
nose
We
gotta
put
some
new
em-phasis
on
our
syllables
[Jay-Z]
If
the
emphasis
on
the
compact
disc
isnt
the
beat
Than
Im
gon
feature
EM
and
get
rich
And
let
Dre
mix
the
shit
and
drive
off
in
the
Range
Ro
Cause
everywhere
I
go
they
love
the
bling
bling
flow
Bang
bang
look
at
the
way
my
chain
glow
The
ring
on
my
fing
cost
Jermaine
a
lot
of
dough
oh
The
fuck
am
I
busting
my
brain
for
Its
just
the
way
the
game
go
oh
it
takes
2
to
tango
You
call
this
a
lame
flow
You
bought
the
shit
I
guess
you
to
blame
too
I
just
found
the
angle
No
more
reality
flow
Im
tryna
time
my
album
dropping
with
a
reality
show
Cock
the
Mac
11
in
front
of
Hot
97
And
call
my
publicist
tell
her
we
in
press
heaven
No
one
gives
a
shit
except
some
kids
who
just
got
into
sex
on
the
internet
So
you
want
the
chat
room
or
the
house
of
Malibu
Em
Your
emphasis
is
on
the
wrong
Syllable
[Dr
Dre]
They
said
30s
the
new
20
Funny
must
mean
40s
the
new
30
Interesting
cause
ever
since
then
its
been
innocence
An
extension
for
veteran
rappers
that
are
better
than
half
Of
the
shit
coming
out
right
now
Its
all
trash
The
torch
is
gonna
burn
out
before
it
gets
passed
Jay
said
its
his
last
and
50
and
Em
Then
what
Detox
drops
what
we
got
then
So
now
our
whole
camps
is
running
around
scrambling
over
what
to
do
Gambling
everytime
we
put
a
record
out
Just
looking
for
that
hook
[Eminem]
Wait
Dre
look
Shorty
I
love
you
And
you
love
me
too
We
were
meant
to

when
I

a
rhyme
But

now
Im
bout
to
draw
the
line
And
for
you
to
cross
it
thats
a
mountain
that
I
doubt

wanna
climb
I
can
describe
areas
of
your
house
you
wouldnt
find
on
an
episode
of
Cribs
a
blow
below
the
ribs
If

Mary
Anns
sayin
cut

Cut

Cause
sometimes
you
just
feel
tired
feel
weak
And
when
you
feel
weak
you
feel
like
you
wanna
just
give
up
But
you
gotta
search
within
you
and
gotta
find
that
inner
strength
and
just
pull
that
shit
out
of
you
And
get
that
motivation
to
not
give
up
And
not
be
a
quitter
no
matter
how
bad
you
wanna
just
fall
flat
on
your
face
and
collapse
Till
I
collapse
Im
spilling
these
raps
long
as
you
feel
em
Till
the
day
that
I
drop
youll
never
say
that
Im
not
killing
em
Cause
when
I
am
not
then
Imma
stop
penning
em
And
I
am
not
hip
hop
and
Im
just
not

Youre

with

or
not
youre
gonna
fear
it
Like
I
showed
you
the

lives

You

to

Is
it
a

is

up
You
bizzels
forgot
Slizzel
does
not
give
a
fuck
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give

cant

Till

Perhaps

till

Music
is
like
magic
theres
a
certain
feeling
you
get
When
you
real
and
you
spit
and
people
are
feeling
your
shit
This
is
your
moment
and
every
single
minute
you
spend
Tryna
hold
on
to
it
because
you
may
never
get
it
again
So
while
youre
in
it
try
to
get
as
much
shit
as
you
can
And
when
your
run
is
over
just
admit
when
its
at
its
end
Because
Im
at
the
end
of
my
wits
with
half
the
shit
that
gets
in
I
got
a
list
heres
the
order
of
my
list
that
its
in
It
goes
Reggie
Jay-Z
2Pac
and
Biggie
Andre
from
OutKast
Jada
Kurupt
Nas
and
then
me
But
in
this
industry
Im
the
cause
of
a
lot
of
envy
So
when
Im
not
put
on
this
list
the
shit
does
not
offend
me
Thats
why
you
see
me
walk
around
like
nothings
bothering
me
Even
though
half
you
people
got
a
fuckin
problem
with
me
You
hate
it
but
you
know
respect
you
got
to
give
me
The
presss
wet
dream
like
Bobby
and
Whitney
Nate
hit
me
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Soon
as
a
verse
starts
I
eat
at
an
emcees
heart
What
is
he
thinking
How
not
to
go
against
me
smart
And
its
absurd
how
people
hang
on
every
word
Ill
probably
never
get
the
props
I
feel
I
ever
deserve
But
Ill
never
be
served
my
spot
is
forever
reserved
If
I
ever
leave
Earth
that
would
be
the
death
of
me
first
Cause
in
my
heart
of
hearts
I
know
nothing
could
ever
be
worse
Thats
why
Im
clever
when
I
put
together
every
verse
My
thoughts
are
sporadic
I
act
like
Im
an
addict
I
rap
like
Im
addicted
to
smack
like
Im
Kim
Mathers
But
I
dont
want
to
go
forth
and
back
in
constant
battles
The
fact
is
I
would
rather
sit
back
and
bomb
some
rappers
So
this
is
like
a
full-blown
attack
Im
launching
at
em
The
track
is
on
some
battling
raps
who
want
some
static
Cause
I
dont
really
think
that
the
fact
that
Im
Slim
matters
A
plaque
and
platinum
status
is
whack
if
Im
not
the
baddest
So
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out
cant
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out
am
I
high
Perhaps
Ima
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Until
the
roof
until
the
roof
The
roof
comes
off
the
roof
comes
off
Until
my
legs
until
my
legs
Give
out
from
underneath
me
I
will
not
fall
I
will
stand
tall
Feels
like
no
one
can
beat
me
I
got
a
song
filled
with
shit
for
the
strong
willed
When
the
world
gives
you
a
raw
deal
Set
you
off
till
you
Scream
piss
off
screw
you
When
it
talks
to
you
like
you
dont
belong
Or
tells
you
youre
in
the
wrong
field
Whens
somethings
in
your
mitochondrial
Cause
it
latched
on
to
you
like
Knock
knock
let
the
devil
in
malevolent
As
Ive
ever
been
head
is
spinnin
and
this
medicine
Screaming
L-l-l-let
us
in
L-l-lick
like
a
salad
bowl
Edgar
Allen
Poe
Bedridden
shoulda
been
dead
a
long
time
ago
Liquid
Tylenol

think
my
skeletons
meltin
Wicked
I
get
all
high
when
I
think
Ive
smelled
the
scent
Of
elephant
manure
Element
glue
screw
it
to
hell
with
it
I
went
through
hell
with
accelerance
and
blew
up
My-my-myself

How

I
be
down
Me

Bizarre
in
Florida
Proofs
room
slept
on
floor
in
the
motel
then
Dr
Dre
said
Hell
yeah
And
I
got
his
stamp
like
a
pouch
card
word
to
Mel-Man
And
I
know
theyre
gonna
hate
but
I
dont
care
I
Barely
could
wait
to
hit
them
with
the
snare
and
the
bass
Square
in
the
face
this
fuckin
world
better
prepare
to
get
laced
Because
theyre
gonna
taste
my
Venom
I
got
that
Adrenaline
in
em
venom
Not
knowing
with
em
Never
gonna
slow
up
in
em
Ready
to
step
in
momentum
Thinking
its
time
to
go
get
em
They
aint
gonna
know
what
hit
em
When
they
get
bitten
with
the
Venom
I
got
that
Adrenaline
in
em
venom
Not

with
em
Never
gonna
slow

em
Ready

Thinking
its

They

When
they
get

with
the
I
said
knock
knock
let
the
devil
in
Shotgun
p-p-pellets
in
the
felt
pin
Cocked
fuck
around
and
catch
a
hot
one
I-i-its
evident
Im
not
done
V-venomous
the
thought
spun
like
your
web
and
you
just
caught
in
em
Held
against
your
will
like
a
hubcap
or
a
mud
flap
Be
strangled
or
attacked
So
this
aint
gonna
feel
like
a
love
tap
Eat
painkiller
pills
fuck
a
blood
track
Like
whats
her
name
at
the
wheel
Then
a
cup
catch
up
Through
the
car
into
reverse
at
the
end
of
the
nut
ration
And
you
look
back
and
its
just
mangled
steel
My
Mustang
and
Jeep
Wrangler
grill
With
the
front
smashed
much
as
my
rear
for
the
assassin
Slim
be
the
combination
of
an
actual
kamikaze
and
Gandhi
Translation
I
will
probably
kill
us
both
when
I
end
up
Backin
into
ya
You
aint
gonna
be
able
to
tell
what
the
fucks
happened
End
of
ya
when
youre

Venom

Chased

Then

drank
till
I
faint
And
I
wait
with
a
headache
and
I
take

Rectangular
shape

I
wait
To
face
the
demons
Im
bonded
