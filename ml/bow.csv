Ah,
yeah
(It's
like
this,
like
this)
This
is
Eminem,
baby,
back
up
in
that
motherfucking
ass
('Til
forever,
'til
forever)
One
time
for
your
motherfuckin'
mind
(For
MC's,
MC's)
We
represent
the
313,
you
know
what
I'm
saying?
Yo,
they
don't
know
shit
about
this,
for
the
'96
Ayo,
my
pen
and
paper
cause
a
chain
reaction
To
get
your
brain
relaxin',
the
zany
actin'
maniac
in
action
A
brainiac
in
fact,
son,
you
mainly
lack
attraction
You
look
insanely
wack
when
just
a
fraction
of
my
tracks
run
My
rhymin'
skills
got
you
climbin'
hills
I
travel
through
your
mind,
and
chill
your
spine
like
siren
drills
I'm
slimin'
grills
of
roaches,
with
spray
that
disinfects
And
twistin'
necks
of
rappers
'Til
their
spinal
column
disconnects
Put
this
in
decks
and
check
the
monologue
Turn
your
system
up,
twist
'em
up
And
indulge
in
the
marijuana
smog
This
is
the
season
for
noise
pollution
contamination
Examination
of
more
car-tunes
than
animation
My
lamination
of
narration
Hits
a
snare
and
bass
on
a
track
for
duck
rapper
interrogation
When
I
declare
invasion
There
ain't
no
time
to
be
starin',
gazin'
I
turn
the
stage
into
a
barren
wasteland
I'm
Infinite;
you
heard
of
Hell
Well,
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it,
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
I'm
trying
to
repent
from
it
But
when
I
hear
the
beat,
I'm
tempted
To
make
another
attempt
at
it;
I'm
Infinite
Bust
it!
I
let
the
beat
commence
So
I
can
beat
the
sense
in
your
elite
defense
I
got
some
meat
to
mince
A
crew
to
stomp,
and
then
two
feet
to
rinse
I
greet
the
gents
and
ladies,
I
spoil
loyal
fans
I
foil
plans
and
leave
fluids
leaking
like
oil
pans
My
coiled
hands
around
this
microphone
are
lethal
One
thought
in
my
cerebral
is
deeper
than
a
jeep-full
of
people
MC's
are
feeble,
I
came
to
cause
some
pandemonium
Battle
a
band
of
phony
MC's,
and
stand
the
lonely
one
Imitator,
intimidator,
stimulator
Simulator
of
data
eliminator
There's
never
been
a
greater
since
the
burial
of
Jesus
Fuck
around
and
catch
all
the
venereal
diseases
My
thesis'll
smash
a
stereo
to
pieces
My
a
cappella
releases
classic
masterpieces
Through
telekinesis,
it
eases
you
mentally
Gently,
sentimentally,
instrumentally
With
entity,
dementedly
meant
to
be
Infinite
I'm
Infinite;
you
heard
of
Hell
Well,
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it,
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
I'm
trying
to
repent
from
it
But
when
I
hear
the
beat,
I'm
tempted
To
make
another
attempt
at
it;
I'm
Infinite
Man,
I
got
evidence,
I'm
never
dense
And
I've
been
clever
ever
since
my
residence
was
hesitant
To
do
some
shit
that
represents
the
MO
So
I'm
assuming
all
responsibility
Cause
there's
a
monster
will
in
me
That
always
wants
to
kill
MCs
Mic
nestler,
slammin'
like
a
wrestler
Here
to
make
a
mess
of
a
lyric
smuggling
embezzler
No
one
is
specialer,
my
skill
is
intergalactical
I
get
cynical,
act
a
fool,
then
I
send
a
crew
back
to
school
I
never
packed
a
tool
or
acted
cool,
it
wasn't
practical
I'd
rather
let
a
tactical,
tactful
track
tickle
your
fancy
In
fact,
I
can't
see,
or
can't
imagine
A
man
who
ain't
a
lover
of
beats
or
a
fan
of
scratchin'
So
this
is
for
my
family,
the
kid
who
had
a
cameo
On
my
last
jam,
plus
the
man
who
never
had
a
plan
B
Be
all
you
can
be,
cause
once
you
make
an
instant
hit
I'm
tensed
a
bit,
and
tempted
When
I
see
the
sins
my
friends
commit
I'm
Infinite;
you
heard
of
Hell
Well,
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it,
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
I'm
trying
to
repent
from
it
But
when
I
hear
the
beat,
I'm
tempted
To
make
another
attempt
at
it;
I'm
Infinite

Verse
1:
Eminem
One
day
I
plan
to
be
a
family
man
happily
married
I
wanna
grow
to
be
so
old
that
I
have
to
be
carried
Till
I'm
glad
to
be
buried
And
leave
this
crazy
world
And
have
at
least
a
half
a
million
for
my
baby
girl
It
may
be
early
to
be
planning
this
stuff
Cause
I'm
still
struggling
hard
to
be
the
man,
and
it's
tough
Cause
man
it's
been
rough,
but
still
I
manage
enough
I've
been
taken
advantage
of,
damaged
and
scuffed
My
hands
have
been
cuffed
But
I
don't
panic
and
huff,
frantic
and
puff
Or
plan
to
give
up,
the
minute
shit
hits
the
fan
it
erupts
I'm
anteing
up
double
or
nothing,
I've
been
trouble
enough
And
I'm
sick
of
struggling
and
suffering,
see
My
destiny's
to
rest
at
ease,
till
I'm
impressed
and
pleased
With
my
progress,
I
won't
settle
for
less
than
cheese
I'm
on
a
quest
to
seize
all,
my
own
label
to
call
Way
before
my
baby
is
able
to
crawl
I'm
too
stable
to
fall,
the
pressure
motivates
To
know
I
hold
the
weight
of
boulders
on
my
shoulder
blades
I
seen
the
golden
gates
to
heaven
on
Earth
Where
they
don't
pull
a
weapon
on
you
when
you
stepping
on
turf,

Verse
2:
Eminem
I'm
going
for
broke,
gambling
and
playing
for
keeps
Everyday
in
the
streets,
scrambling
and
paying
for
cheep
Praying
for
sleep
Dreaming
with
a
watering
mouth
Wishing
for
a
better
life
for
my
daughter
and
spouse
In
this
slaughtering
house,
caught
up
in
bouts
With
the
root
of
all
evil
I've
seen
it
turn
beautiful
people
crude
and
deceitful
And
make
them
do
shit
illegal
For
these
Grant's
and
Jackson's
These
transactions
explain
a
man's
actions
But
in
the
mist
of
this
insanity,
I
found
my
Christianity
Through
God
and
there's
a
wish
he
granted
me
He
showed
me
how
to
cope
with
the
stress
And
hope
for
the
best,
instead
of
mope
and
depressed
Always
groping
a
mess,
of
flying
over
the
nest
To
selling
dope
with
the
rest
I
quit
smoking
cess
to
open
my
chest
Life
is
stressful
inside
this
cesspool
Trying
to
wrestle,
I
almost
bust
a
blood
vessel
My
little
brother's
trying
to
learn
his
mathematics
He's
asthmatic,
running
home
from
school
away
from
crack
addicts
Kids
attract
static,
children
with
automatics
Taking
target
practice
on
teens
for
Starter
Jackets
I'm
using
smarter
tactics
to
overcome
this
slum
I
won't
become
as
dumb
as
some
and
succumb
to
scum
It's
cumbersome,
I'm
trying
to
do
well
on
this
Earth
But
it's
been
Hell
on
this
Earth
since
I
fell
on
this
Earth

I'm

My

Boy
I'm

,
my

thick

With

I'm

can't

I
got
more
Different

On

I
bone

We
elevated
to
new
heights
premeditated
Let
it
be
that
I
stated
they
hate
it
now
that
they
see
that
I
made
it
The
escalated
can
be
put
to
the
test
of
greatness
Snatch
the
heart
from
MC's
and
I
ate
it
So
I
take
it
that's
the
reason
I'm
hated
To
represent
my
temperment
If
rap
was
a
dick
all
you
so
called
hard
MC's
would
not
be
impitant
But
pimping
it,
and
acting
like
you
could
rock
a
show
(so)
Harder
than
LL's
Rock
the
Bells,
but
you
is
a
ho
(now)
Everything
that
you
collaborate
I
lacerate
My
rhymes
they
keep
coming
like
nympho
maniacs
that
masturbate
At
a
faster
rate,
yeah
I
got
something
for
your
ass
to
hate
I
blasterate,
and
have
you
all
running
master
gates
And
as
for
face
clutching
and
touching
the
flows
I
got
them
open
like
marijuana
smoke
up
in
your
nose
Bucking
these
hoes,
I
got
that
shit
down
to
a
science
Leaving
them
hot
and
bothered,
turned
on
like
an
appliance
Defiance,
no
we
won't
have
that
You
want
your
shit
to
blow
up?
Well
I'ma
stuff
some
dynamite
in
your

crack
And
blast
that
shit
to

Then
bring

some

I
drop

and
you
ain't

And
you
all
knew

That

your

flowers
got
no
clout

You
could

wouldn't

simple

over

rock
the

Dethrone

Relax
your

Verse
2:
Ayo,
biters
are
like
tarantulas,
vandealous
Living
as
scandalous
as
a
television
evangelist
But
I
can
handle
this,
I'm
the
rhyme
biter
crime
fighter
Caped
crusader,
taking
care
of
undeserving
lime
lighters
I
think
a
living
never
meant
for
me
Experimentally
I
found
a
way
to
spread
interamentally
When
I
stumbled
upon
this
resolution
By
using
a
special
fusion
of
chemical
solution
for
this
resolution
You
couldn't
see
me
with
binoculars
I
armed
like
an
octopus
Step
on
stage
and
you
get
socked
and
pushed
Talking
that
junk
like
you
went
black,
guarded
your
back
Come
battle
me
and
you
get
smacked
as
hard
as
you
act
When
I
rap
I
represent
it
and
will
never
referee
in
it
Every
minute
so
when
I
win
it
you
never
resent
it
I'm
forever
demented,
come
up
with
funk,
I'll
never
be
scented
You
got
the
point
when
I
cleverly
said
it

Till

Verse
3:
Eminem
is
heading
skyward
For
those
who
thought
that
I
would
make
you
bored
and
treat
you
like
a
piece
of
plywood
I've
got
miracle
lyrical
capability
all
in
me
With
the
agility
to
escape
a
killer
bee
colony
So
get
your
cameras
and
capture
how
miraculous
I
rap
for
all
you
Draculas
and
showed
you
all
how
whack
you
was
I
meant
it
as
a
dis,
cause
you
don't
posses
the
pizzazz
as
this
I'm
hazardous
enough
already
as
it
is
Without
you
adding
fuel
to
the
fire
I'm
cruel
to
the
liar
Who
fails
to
recognize
my
reign
of
hell,
rule
to
the
sire
Clinical
studies
show
that
I'm
cynical
There's
no
one
who's
identical
to
my
fresh
and
authentic
flow
I'm
sure
the
party
people
can
agree
That
I'm
enchanting,
with
the
romantic
Freaking
the
vocals
so
frantically
So
throw
your
hands
up
in
the
atmosphere
And
let
them
know
the
only
party
that
was
phat
was
here,
just
be
like

Maxine:
Hello
Denaun:
Can
I
speak
to
Maxine?
Maxine:
Yeah
this

me
what's

Denaun:
What

Maxine:
Who
dis?
Denaun:
Denaun
Maxine:
Yeah
what's

Denaun:
What
are
you

Maxine:
Nothing,

Denaun:
Huh?
Maxine:
Nothing,
just
laying

Denaun:
Why?
Maxine:
I
don't

thinking
about
something
freaky
to
do
Verse
1:
Eminem
I
know
this
crack
fiend
Maxine
who
needs
a
vaccine
She
tests
positive
but
tells
you
that
her
act's
clean
Plus
she
got
a
sugar
daddy
Asking
every
hooker
that
he
takes
in
to
crook
her
badly
If
you
mistook
her
sadly,
on
her
reputation
You're
in
jepordation,
if
you
ain't
got
no
preparation
When
you
step
away
son,
she
got
her
face
done
Looking
provocative,
she'll
let
you
knock
it
if
You
press
the
issue
and
get
undressed
to
kiss
you
If
you
match
the
price,
otherwise
she
won't
look
at
you
twice
But
when
you
catch
the
lice,
or
get
the
urgency
To
go
to
the
emergency
cause
it
burns
to
pee
Don't
bring
your
germs
to
me,
cause
I
ain't
trying
to
hear
it
While
your
fighting
you
fucking
disease
trying
to
clear
it
(Maxine!!)
Verse
2:
Denaun
Porter
Sometimes
I
wonder,
what's
your
purpose?
In
life
that
is
To
get
with
every
brother
and
unveil
one
of
his
kids,
shit
You
living
trife,
got
three
kids
at
home
and
club
hopping
every
night
You
say
it's
gonna
stop
but
it..
just..
slows..
down
And
then
speeds
back
to
a
regular
pace,
there
is
no
end
to
this
Mystery,
whatever
your
reason
even
is
to
be
You
say
you
wanna
be
with
me,
but
how
can
you
say
that
When
you
got
niggas
hiding
in
your
closet
I
refrain
from
getting
angry
but
you
keep
on
that
strangely
Verse
3:
3
I
met
this
girl
last
week,
she
was
a
freak,
and
she
liked
me
So
I
stepped
on
it
and
then
asked
my
homies
And
chilled
on
the
side
and
then
watched
they
niggas
Big
game
over
there
and
take
notes,
while
I
get
this
number
I
stepped
to
her
first
I
cleared
my
throat
and
said
"Hey
Bitch..
Haven't
I
seen
you
before?",
looked
at
my
nigga
Turned
around
and
got
slapped
throughout
my
hands
And
said
"Oh
it's
like
that?"
She
said
she
just
broke
up
with
her
nigga
and
shit
She
started
crying,
and
asked
me
to
forgive
her
and
shit
She
said
her
name
was
Maxine,
so
I
told
her
I
wanted
her
number
She
asked
could
I
give
her
mine
two
Got
to
the
crib
and
called
her
up
We
got
into
a
good
conversation
that's
when
she
asked
me
could
I
fuck
I
said
"Maxine
check
this
out,
Give
me
your
address
I'll
be
through
and
you'll
find
out"
Got
to
the
crib
she
let
me
in
She
didn't
waste
time
she
grabbed
my
hand
and
proceeded
to
the
bedroom
I
said
"Hold
up,
and
stop
proceeding,
you
rushing
things"
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing?
So
I
went
for
my
protection,
took
off
my
clothes
and
started
flexing
As
she
went
for
my
midsection
I
threw
her
down
as
I
tore
off
her
shirt
Pulled
out
my
jimmy
and
I
thought
about
putting
in
work
Before
I
hit
it
she
said
"3
don't
get
mad
but
there's
something
that
I
gotta
tell
your
ass"
I
said
"What
is
it,
another
nigga?
It's
ok"
She
said
"No
I
forgot
to
tell
you,
that
I
got
AIDS"
I
got
up
out
Denaun:
Hey,
Maxine
Maxine:
What
Denaun:
You
thinking
about
sucking
my
dick?
Maxine:
Yeah

a
small
price
Denaun:
For
a
small
price?
What
you
mean?
Maxine:
You
know,
money
nigga
Denaun:
You
don't
need
no
damn
money,
I
can't
give
you
no
money

I

shit.
Maxine:

What

Denaun:

Maxine:

Who

bullshit?
Denaun:

Kyu,

Maxine:

the
case,
Kyu

then
Denaun:
Oh

Maxine:

Well

Eminem
I'll
have
you
taken
back
to
Christ
when
you
sacrifice
The
way
you
acting
slice
when
I
tear
your
back
with
knifes
Jacking
life's
of
MC's,
now
I'm
set
to
launch
a
plan
For
blowing
up
the
stage
with
illegal
contraband
A
stomped
your
man
so
unless
you
want
what
he
got
You
better
set
the
mic
down,
I'm
steaming
like
a
teapot
I'll
make
the
tea
hot,
people
get
in
my
face
and
ask
If
I
wanna
battle,
then
I
chase
them
in
a
Jason
mask
It's
an
amazing
task
to
battle
with
success
I
never
gave
a
fuck,
now
I
give
a
fuck
less
And
in
a
slug
fest
I
get
physical
like
physicians
Invisible
like
magicians
with
mystical
mic
traditions
Wicked
wizardry,
like
a
sorcerer
and
no
remorse
for
you
When
I
torture
you
throughout
the
course
of
my
orchestra
So
feel
the
force
of
my
spiritual
images
Slicing
up
an
enemy's
appendages
till
he
hemorrhages
My
skin
itches
every
time
a
rapper
recites
And
when
he's
through
with
his
verse,
I'm
all
covered
in
flea
bites
You
wanna
see
fights
I
got
a
match
for
you
You
couldn't
flip
shit
playing
in
toilets
with
a
spatula

You

disrespecting

You
wanna

hand
a

to

Intellectually

I'll

Inferior,

Materially,

How

Shiver
and
shake,
quiver

Bite
a

and
rip
it
off
then
stiffer
and
ache,
whither
and
break
You
slithering
snake,
gibbering
fake,
fibbering
flake
I'll
twist
you
into
a
different
shape
And
toss
you
in
Michigan
Lake,
for
fisherman
sake
If
this

a
dream
you'd
wish
you
can
wake
Every
dis
you

personal
We
ain't
friends
trying

amends
If
you
ain't
ever
stole
a
gate
you
can
take
a

I
make
intense
masterpieces
and
smash
to
pieces
Your
last
releases,
you
bad
diseases,
that's
the
reason
I'm
showing
you
the
proper
way
to
operate
a

So
pass
it
like
a

Severing

I

I

Look

gotta
make
some
hit
records
or
something,
you
know
what
I'm

Cause
I'm
tired
of
being
broke
Verse
1:
Cause
all
I
do
is
yearn
a
life
without
a
concern
And
dream
of
having
a
turn
to
earn
money
to
burn
Mapping
out
my
strategies
to
get
rich
huh
My
desire
is
like
a
scratch
that
needs
to
get
itched
huh
Cause
man
I
live
in
the
D,
this
shit
ain't
given
for
free
Nothing's
different
to
me,
so
what,
it's
easy
to
see
I'll
be
the
prisoner
to
flee,
all
of
this
misery
I'm
not
wishing
to
be
another
fish
in
the
sea
But
just
an
MC,
so
listen
to
me,
but
if
you
disagree
You
missing
the
key,
you
ain't
even
in
the
brisk
of
the
tea
Unconditionally
my
aspects
to
cash
checks
My
objects
were
never
to
swab
decks
It's
up
to
you
the
decision
is
yours
If
what
you
vision
is
tours,
or
a
mission
less
course
When
shit
is
in
the
stores,
cause
you
can
be
a
star
Chorus:
No
matter
wherever
you
are,
you're
never
too
far
From
revenue
huh,
cause
you
can
be
king
You
can
rule
the
world,
you
can
do
anything
It's
on
you
baby,
cause
you
can
be
a
star
No
matter
wherever

Verse
1:
Eminem
I'm
reminiscing
on
your
tenderness
and
the
snuggling
and
teasing
Missing
what
I
remember,
kissing
and
hugging
and
squeezing
Bugging
and
weezing,
I'm
having
trouble
when
breathing
It's
even
tougher
when
sleeping
But
there's
a
couple
of
reasons
that
I'm
suffering
and
grieving
For
loving
and
leaving,
you
all
I'm
thinking
of
in
the
evening
You
got
my
knees
buckling
and
weakening
Thoughts
of
nothing
but
freaking
that
I'm
struggling
to
keep
in
And
interrupt
when
I'm
speaking
I
got
some
game
that
I'm
preparing
to
run
The
way
your
lips
sparkle
and
glare
in
the
sun
You
got
your
hair
in
a
bun,
no
matter
what
you're
wearing
you
stun
Cause
your
comparing
to
none,
I
wanna
share
in
the
fun
I
feel
a
passionate
lust
when
I'm
imagining
just
us
alone
at
last
with
a
touch
I
see
you
grasping
to
trust,
but
my
intentions
are
good
The
seed
is
passing
in
dust
I'm
not
asking
to
rush
and
answer
immediately
I
just
wanna
be
there
for
you
and
you
to
be
there
for
me
If
you
agree
to
repeat
after
me,
I
Love
You
(I
love
you
baby)
Cause
I
just
need
you
to
see,
how
much
I'm
eager
to
be
Your
man
legally
wed,
your
love's
keeping
me
fed
This
is
easily
said,
so
you
can
lead
or
be
led
If
you
care
to
be
down
cause
ain't
nobody
Like
you
no
where
to
be
found

Now

mercifully
For
what
he
first
did
to
me
It's
sure
to
be
the
last
Following
footprints
with
a
magnifying
glass
To
drag
his
lying
ass
back
to
his
padded
cell
I'm
mad
as
hell,
on
the
trail
of
the
tattle
tail
I

a

the
voice
sounded
familiar
"Give

I
followed

down
a
flight

Sneezing
at

spider-webs
Inside
the
depths
of
his
basement
I
taste
lint
in
my
mouth,
then
the
lights
in
the
place?went!
I
saw
my
life
flash
in
front
of
my
eyes
I
felt
a
butcher
knife
slash
at
one
of
my
thighs
None
of
my
guys
knew
where
I'm
at
I
was
doomed
Then
I
remembered
the
flashlight
in
my
costume
Chorus:
I

Dealing

They're

I
yearned
for

that
we
finally
met
again
So
I
can
give
him
a
taste
of
his
own
medicine
He
shed
his
skin,
then
he
promised
to
come
clean
I
took
his
butcher
knife
and
jabbed
it
into
his
spleen
Cut
him
at
the
seam
then
dragged
the
fella
home
Beating
him
over
the

Verse
1:
I
come
home
every
single
day
from
working
double
shifts
And
stop
along
the
way
to
pick
you
up
a
couple
gifts
I
come
inside
and
you
pretend
you
miss
me
when
you
kiss
me
Then
you
diss
me
and
we
strenuously
fight
continuously
Again
you
frisk
me,
for
numbers
trying
to
bust
me
It
must
be
only
just
because
you
never
learned
to
trust
me
Plus
we
only
grovel
only
irrelevant
issues
To
many
tissues,
for
my
feelings
you
misuse
I
buy
you
jewelry,
you
make
a
fool
of
me
I
bring
you
diamond
rings
you
say
I'm
bad
at
timing
things
So
what's
a
man
to
do
when
all
i
hand
to
you
is
handed
back
to
me
You
act
to
be
this
gangsta
bitch,
that
ain't
what
first
attracted
me
I
used
to
love
your
company
now
you
always
bugging
me
For
information
and
you
tell
your
friends
you
plan
on
dumping
me
So
I'ma
wait
for
your
evacuation
Cause
every
accusation
makes
me
wanna
smack
your
face
in
See
I've
never
been
so
sure,
and
your
just
insecure
So
my
solution
to
your
jealousy
presents
a
cure
I
recommend
you
take
your
things
and
check
them
in
Look
at
the
nervous
wreck
I'm
in,
I
need
my
second
wind,
Say
What?

It

Leaving
me
in
sorrow,
Brandy
never

I
fell

I
was

you

And
I
became

now
I'm
on

And

your

All

from
Phife
He
goes,
"You
didn't

me
to

you
then,
I
don't

Take
a
towel,
wipe
your
brow,
quit
trying
to
hunt
me
down
You
run
me
down
and
now
your
trying
to
apologize
For
all
the
lies
and
everytime
you
made
me
ball
my
eyes
Because
I

Life..
by
Marshall
Mathers
What
is
life?
Life
is
like
a
big
obstacle
put
in
front
of
your
optical
to
slow
you
down
And
everytime
you
think
you
gotten
past
it
it's
gonna
come
back
around
and
tackle
you
to
the
damn
ground
What
are
friends?
Friends
are
people
that
you
think
are
your
friends
But
they
really
your
enemies,
with
secret
indentities
and
disguises,
to
hide
they
true
colors
So
just
when
you
think
you
close
enough
to
be
brothers
they
wanna
come
back
and
cut
your
throat
when
you
ain't
lookin
What
is
money?
Money
is
what
makes
a
man
act
funny
Money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
Money'll
make
them
same
friends
come
back
around
swearing
that
they
was
always
down
What
is
life?
I'm
tired
of
life
I'm
tired
of
backstabbing
ass
snakes
with
friendly
grins
I'm
tired
of
committing
so
many
sins
Tired
of
always
giving
in
when
this
bottle
of
Henny
wins
Tired
of
never
having
any
ends
Tired
of
having
skinny
friends
hooked
on
crack
and
mini-thins
I'm
tired
of
this
DJ
playing
YOUR
shit
when
he
spins
Tired
of
not
having
a
deal
Tired
of
having
to
deal
with
the
bullshit
without
grabbing
the
steel
Tired
of
drowning
in
my
sorrow
Tired
of
having
to
borrow
a
dollar
for
gas
to
start
my
Monte
Carlo
I'm
tired
of
motherfuckers
spraying
shit
and
dartin
off
I'm
tired
of
jobs
startin
off
at
five
fifty
an
hour
then
this
boss
wanders
why
I'm
smartin
off
I'm
tired
of
being
fired
everytime
I
fart
and
cough
Tired
of
having
to
work
as
a
gas
station
clerk
for
this
jerk
breathing
down
my
neck
driving
me
bezerk
I'm
tired
of
using
plastic
silverware
Tired
of
working
in
Building
Square
Tired
of
not
being
a
millionaire
But
if
I
had
a
million
dollars
I'd
buy
a
damn
brewery,
and
turn
the
planet
into
alcoholics
If
I
had
a
magic
wand,
I'd
make
the
world
suck
my
dick
without
a
condom
on,
while
I'm
on
the
john
If
I
had
a
million
bucks
it
wouldn't
be
enough,
because
I'd
still
be
out
robbing
armored
trucks
If
I
had
one
wish
I
would
ask
for
a
big
enough
ass
for
the
whole
world
to
kiss
I'm
tired
of
being
white
trash,
broke
and
always
poor
Tired
of
taking
pop
bottles
back
to
the
party
store
I'm
tired
of
not
having
a
phone
Tired
of
not
having
a
home
to
have
one
in
if
I
did
have
it
on
Tired
of
not
driving
a
BM
Tired
of
not
working
at
GM,
tired
of
wanting
to
be
him
Tired
of
not
sleeping
without
a
Tylenol
PM
Tired
of
not
performing
in
a
packed
coliseum
Tired
of
not
being
on
tour
Tired
of
fucking
the
same
blonde
whore
after
work
in
the
back
of
a
Contour
I'm
tired
of
faking
knots
with
a
stack
of
ones
Having
a
lack
of
funds
and
resorting
back
to
guns
Tired
of
being
stared
at
I'm
tired
of
wearing
the
same
damn
Nike
Air
hat
Tired
of
stepping
in
clubs
wearing
the
same
pair
of
Lugz
Tired
of
people
saying
they're
tired
of
hearing
me
rap
about
drugs
Tired
of
other
rappers
who
ain't
bringin
half
the
skill
as
me
saying
they
wasn't
feeling
me
on
"Nobody's
As
Ill
As
Me"
I'm
tired
of
radio
stations
telling
fibs
Tired
of
J-L-B
saying
"Where
Hip-Hop
Lives"
But
if
I
had
a
million
dollars
I'd
buy
a
damn
brewery,
and
turn
the
planet
into
alcoholics
If
I
had
a

I'd

You
know
what
I'm
saying?
I'm
tired
of
all
of
this
bullshit
Telling
me
to
be
positive
How'm
I
'sposed
to
be
positive
when
I
don't
see
shit
positive?
Know
what
I'm
sayin?
I
rap
about
shit
around
me,
shit
I
see
Know
what
I'm
sayin?
Right
now
I'm
tired
of
everything
Tired
of
all
this
player
hating
that's
going
on
in
my
own
city
Can't
get
no
airplay,

But

C'mon
Hai-Hai,
we
goin
to
the
beach
Grab
a

Oh

She's
takin
a
little
nap
in
the

Oh

runned
over
a

Now
I
know
what
you're
thinkin
-
it's
kind
of
late
to
go
swimmin
But
you
know
your
mama,
she's
one
of
those
type
of
women
that
do
crazy
things,
and
if
she
don't
get
her
way,
she'll
throw
a
fit
Don't
play
with
da-da's
toy
knife,
honey,
let

of
it
(no!)
And
don't
look
so
upset,
why
you
actin
bashful?
Don't
you
wanna
help
da-da
build
a
sand
castle?
(yeah!)
And
mama
said
she
wants
to
show
how
far
she
can
float
And
don't
worry
about
that
little
boo-boo
on
her
throat
It's
just
a
little
scratch
-
it
don't
hurt,
her
was
eatin
dinner
while
you
were
sweepin
and
spilled
ketchup
on

Mama's

I'll

But

we'll
just

She
was
bein
mean
to

and
made
him
real
real

But
I

Sit

Makes

I'm

Two-Face,
I'm
painful

then
you
can
tell
From
these
shells,
how
I
gotta
bend
'em
like

canals
I
erase
all
trails,
somethin'
farther
from
gettin'
bail
Makes
you
wanna
kill
an
emcee
yourself,
you
might
as
well
Be
within
a
25
to
life
sentence,
on
linkin'
trials
Horrified,
and
keep

Everything

Niggas

I'm

Niggas

Ripped
this
old

hung

neck
by
a
hook
Didn't
realize
it
was
my
grandmother
'til
I
checked
her

Fuckin'

Throwin'

My

Cuz

Especially

freshly
New
Lugz,
give
the

hugs,
guzzle
two
mugs
Before
I
do
drugs
that
make
me
throw
up
like
flu
bugs
True
thugs,
rugged
unshaven
messy
scrubs
Whippin'
40-bottles
like
the

Down

I'm

Stab

Sprayed

I
ran

Fuckin'

Talkin'

Kidnapped

(2x)
Left
the
keys
in
the
van,
with
a
gat
in
each
hand
Went
up
in
Eastland
and
shot
a
policeman
Fuck
a
peace
plan
of
citizen
bystands
But
shit
is
in
my
hands,
here's
your
life
span
For
what
your
life's
worth
this
money
is
twice
than
Grab
a
couple
grand
and
live
a
nice
land
See
I'm
a
nice
man
but
money
turned
me
to
Satan
I'm
thirsty
for
this
green
so
bad
I'm
dehydratin'
Hurry
up
with
the
cash
bitch,
I
got
a
ride
waitin'
Shot
a
man
twice
in
the
back
when
he
tried
escapin'
I
want
the
whole
plot,
I
won't
be
denied
nathan
Maybe
I
need
my
head
inside
straightened
Brain
contemplatin',
clean
out
the
register
Dip
before
somebody
catches
ya
Or
gets
ya
description
an'
sketches
ya
The
connection
was
the
prime
suspect
But
I
ain't
set
to
flee
the
scene
of
the
crime
just
yet
Cuz
I
got
a
daughter
to
feed
And
$200
ain't
enough
to
water
the
seed
The
best
thing
would
be
for
me
to
leave
Taco
Bell
an'
hit
up
Chess
King
And
have
the
lady
at
the
desk
bring
Money
from
the
safe
in
the
back,
stepped
in
wavin'
the
Mac
Cooperate
and
we
can
operate
and
save
an
attack
This
bitch
tried
escapin'
the
jack
Grabbed
her
by
the
throat,
it's
murder
she
wrote
You
barely
heard
a
word
as
she
choked
It
wasn't
nuttin'
for
her
to
be
smoked
But
I
slammed
her
on
her
back
'til
her
vertebrae
broke
Just
then
the
pigs
bust
in
yellin'
"Freeze!"
But
I'm
already
wanted
for
sellin'
keys
And
bunch
of
other
felonies
from
A
to
Z
like
spellin'
bees
So
before
I
dropped
to
the
ground
and
fell
on
knees
I
bust
shots,
they
bust
back
Hit
the
square
in
the
chest,
he
wasn't
wearin'
a
vest
CHORUS
2x
Left
the
house,
pullin'
out
the
drive
backin'
out
Need
a
backin'
out
this
lady's
Jag
started
blackin'
out
Pulled
the
Mac-10
out,
stuck
it
in
her
face
Shut
ya
yackin'
mouth
before
I
blow
the
brain
from
out
the
back
ya
scalp
Drug
her
by
her
hair,
smacked
her
up
Thinkin'
fuck
it,
mug
her
while
you're
there,
jacked
her
up
Stole
her
car,
made
a
profit
Grabbed
the
tape
from
out
the
deck
and
offed
it
out
the
window
Like
the
girl
on
Set
It
Off
did
Jetted
off
kid,
stole
the
whip,
now
I'm
a
criminal
Drove
in
thru
somebody's
yard,
dove
into
they
swimmin'
pool
Climbed
out
and
collapsed
on
the
patio
I
made
it
out
alive
but
I'm
injured
badly
though
Parents
screamin':
"Son,
go
in
and
call
the
police
Tell
'em
there's
a
crazy
man
disturbing
all
of
the
peace!"
Tried
to
stall
him
at
least
long
enough
to
let
me
leap
up
Run
in
they
crib
and
at
least
leave
with
some
little
cheap
stuff
Actin'
like
they
never
seen
nobody
hit
a
nick
before
Smashed
the
window,
grabbed
the
Nintendo
64
When
they
sell
out
in
stores
the
price
triples
I
ran
up
the
block
jumpin'
kids
on
tricycles
And
colliding
with
an
80-year
old
lady
with
groceries
There
goes
the
cheese,
eggs,
milk
and
Post
Toasties
Stood
up
and
started
to
see
stars
Too
many
siren
sounds,
it
seemed
like
a
thousand
police
cars
Barely
escaped,
must-a
been
some
dumb
luck
Jumped
up
and
climbed
the
back
of
a
movin'
dump
truck
But
I
think
somebody
seen
me
maybe
Plus
I
lost
the
damn
Nintendo
and
I
must-a
dropped
the
Beanie
Baby
Fuck
it
I
give
up,
I'm
surrounded
in
blue
suits
Came
out
with
a
white
flag
hollerin'
"TRUCE
TRUCE!"
Surrendered
my
weapon
to
cops
Wasn't
me!
It
was
the
gangsta
rap
and
the
peppermint
Schnopps

My

But
I
can't
figure
out
which
Spice
Girl
I
want

impregnate
(um...)
And
Dr.
Dre
said
"Slim
Shady,
you
a
basehead!"
Uh-uh!
"So
why's
your
face
red?
Man,
you
wasted!"
Well,
since
age
twelve
I
felt
like
I'm
someone
else
‘Cause
I
hung
my
original
self
from
the
top
bunk
with
a
belt
Got
pissed
off
and
ripped
Pamela
Lee's
tits
off,
and
smacked
her
so
hard
I
knocked
her
clothes
backwards
like
Kris
Kross
I
smoke
a
fat
pound
of
grass,
and
fall
on
my
ass
Faster
than
a
fat
bitch
who
sat
down
too
fast
Come
here,
slut!
"Shady,
wait
a
minute,
that's
my
girl,
dog!"
I
don't
give

God
sent

My

Thanks

35
I
smacked
him
in
his
face
with
an
eraser
Chased
him
with
a
stapler,
stapled
his
nuts
to
a
stack
of
papers
Walked
in
the
strip
club,
had
my
jacket
zipped
up
Flashed
the
bartender,
then
stuck
my
dick
in
the
tip
cup
Extraterrestrial,
running
over
pedestrians
in
a
spaceship
While
they're
screaming
at
me,
"Let's
just
be
friends!"
Ninety-nine
percent
of
my
life
I
was
lied
to
I
just
found
out
my
mom
does
more
dope
than
I
do
(damn)
I
told
her
I'd
grow
up
to
be
a
famous
rapper
Make
a
record
about
doing
drugs
and
name
it
after
her
You
know
you
blew
up
when
the
women
rush
your
stands
And
try
to
touch
your
hands
like
some
screaming
Usher
fans
This
guy
at
White
Castle
asked
for
my
autograph
(Dude,
can
I
get
your
autograph?)
So
I
signed
it:
"Dear

Dr.

don't

stand

I'm
not

scary

I'll
have
to
be
carried
inside
the
cemetery
and
buried
alive
(Yup)
Am
I
coming
or
going?
I
can
barely
decide
I
just
drank
a
fifth
of
vodka,
dare
me
to
drive?
(Go
ahead!)
All
my
life
I
was
very
deprived
I
ain't
had
a
woman
in
years
and
my
palm's
too
hairy
to
hide
(Whoops)
Clothes
ripped
like
the
Incredible
Hulk
I
spit
when
I
talk,
I'll
fuck
anything
that
walks
(Come
here!)
When
I
was
little
I
used
to
get
so
hungry
I
would
throw
fits
How
you
gonna
breastfeed
me,
Mom?
You
ain't
got
no
tits!
I
lay
awake
and
strap
myself
in
the
bed
Put
a
bulletproof
vest
on
and
shoot
myself
in
the
head
(Bang!)
I'm
steaming
mad
and
by
the
way,
when
you
see
my
dad
(Yeah?)
Tell
him
that
I
slit
his
throat
in
this
dream
I
had
Hi,

Meet
Eddie,
23
years
old.
Fed
up
with
life
and
the
way
things
are
going
(I'm
going
fucking
insane),
he
decides
to
rob
a
liquor
store
(I
can't
take
this
no
more,
I
can't
take
it
no
more,
homes).
But
on
his
way
in
he
has
a
sudden
change
of
heart
(Shit
is
mine),
and
suddenly
(I
gotta
do
this)
his
conscience
comes
into
play
(I
gotta
do
this).
Alright,
stop
(Uh?),
now
before
you
walk
in
the
door
Of
this
liquor
store
and
try
to
get
money
out
the
drawer
You
better
think
of
the
consequence
(Who
are
you?)
I'm
your
motherfuckin'
conscience!
That's
nonsense!
Go
in,
gaffle
the
money,
and
run
to
one
of
your
aunt's
cribs
And
borrow
a
damn
dress
and
one
of
her
blond
wigs
(Can
I
borrow
this?)
Tell
her
you
need
a
place
to
stay,
you'll
be
safe
for
days
If
you
shave
your
legs
with
Renee's
razor
blades
Yeah,
but
if
it
all
goes
through
like
it's
supposed
to
The
whole
neighborhood
knows
you
and
they'll
expose
you
Think
about
it
before
you
walk
in
the
door
first
Look
at
the
store
clerk,
she's
older
than
George
Burns
Fuck
that,
do
that
shit!
Shoot
that
bitch!
Can
you
afford
to
blow
this
shit,
are
you
that
rich?
Why
you
give
a
fuck
if
she
dies?
Are
you
that
bitch?
Do
you
really
think
she
gives
a
fuck
if
you
have
kids?
Man,
don't
do
it,
it's
not
worth
it
to
risk
it
(You're
right!)
Not
over
this
shit
(Stop!),
drop
the
biscuit
(I
will!)
Don't
even
listen
to
Slim,
yo,
he's
bad
for
you
You
know
what,
Dre?
I
don't
like
your
attitude
Stan:
Come
on,
just
come
in
here
for
a
minute.
Girl:
I
don't
know.
Stan:
Look...
Girl:
Damn.
Stan:
Look,
it's
gonna
be
alright,
alright?
Girl:
Oh—okay.
Stan:
Give
me
a
kiss.
Pull
your
pants
off,
come
on.
Meet
Stan,
21
years
old.
After
meeting
a
young
girl
at
a
rave
party,
things
start
getting
hot
and
heavy
in
an
upstairs
bedroom.
Once
again,
his
conscience
comes
into
play.
Now
listen
to
me,
while
you're
kissin'
her
cheek
And
smearin'
her
lipstick,
I
slipped
this
in
her
drink
Now
all
you
gotta
do
is
nibble
on
this
little
bitch's
earlobe
Yo,
this
girl's
only
fifteen
years
old
You
shouldn't
take
advantage
of
her,
it's
not
fair
Yo,
look
at
her
bush,
does
it
got
hair?
(Huh-uh)
Fuck
this
bitch
right
here
on
the
spot,
bare
'Til
she
passes
out
and
she
forgot
how
she
got
there
Man,
ain't
you
ever
seen
that
one
movie
Kids?
No,
but
I
seen
the
porno
with
Sun
Doobiest
Shit,
you
wanna
get
hauled
off
to
jail?
Man,
fuck
that,
hit
that
shit
raw
dog,
then
bail
(Man,
it
feels
good
to
be
home.)
Meet
Grady,
a
29-year-old
construction
worker.
After
coming
home
from
a
hard
day's
work,
he
walks
in
the
door
of
his
trailer
park
home
to
find
his
wife
in
bed
with
another
man.
(What
the
fuck!?
—
Grady!)
Alright,
calm
down,
relax,
start
breathin'
Fuck
that
shit,
you
just
caught
this
bitch
cheatin'
While
you
at
work
she's
with
some
dude
tryin'
to
get
off
Fuck
slittin'
her
throat,
cut
this
bitch's
head
off!
Wait,
what
if
there's
an
explanation
for
this
shit?
What,
she
tripped,
fell,
landed
on
his
dick?
Alright,
Shady,
maybe
he's
right,
Grady
But
think
about
the
baby
before
you
get
all
crazy
Okay,
thought
about
it?
Still
wanna
stab
her?
Grab
her
by
the
throat,
get
your
daughter
and
kidnap
her?
That's
what
I
did,
be
smart,
don't
be
a
retard
You
gonna
take
advice
from
somebody
who
slapped
Dee
Barnes?
(What
you
say?)
What's
wrong?
Didn't
think
I'd
remember?
(I'ma
kill
you,
motherfucker!)
Huh-uh-uh,

Mr.
Dre,
Mr.
N.W.A,
Mr.
AK
Comin'

Compton,

How

the
fuck

gonna
tell
this
man
not
to
be
violent?
'Cause
he
don't
need
to
go
the
same
route
that
I
went
Been
there,
done
that
Aw,

Shoot

Grady!
Where's

gun

We're

Oh

These

the
results
of
a
thousand
electric
volts
A
neck

A
kid
who
refused
to
respect
adults
Wore
spectacles
with
taped
frames
and
a
freckled
nose
A
corny
lookin
white
boy,
scrawny
and
always
ornery
Cause
I
was
always
sick
of
brawny
bullies
pickin
on
me
And
I
might
snap,
one
day
just
like
that
I
decided
to
strike
back
and
flatten
every
tire
on
the
bike
rack
(Whosssssh)
My
first
day
in
junior
high,
this
kid
said,
"It's
you
and
I,
three
o'clock
sharp
this
afternoon
you
die"
I
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
one
twenty
"I
already
gave
you
my
lunch
money
what
more
do
you
want
from
me?!?"
He
said,
"Don't
try
to
run
from
me,
you'll
just
make
it
worse..."
My
palms
were
sweaty,
and
I
started
to
shake
at
first
Something
told
me,
"Try
to
fake
a
stomach
ache
it
works"
I
screamed,
"Owww!
My
appendix
feels
like
they
could
burst!
Teacher,
teacher,
quick
I
need
a
naked
nurse!"
[N]
"What's
the
matter?"
[E]
"I
don't
know,
my
leg,
it
hurts!"
[N]
"Leg?!?
I
thought
you
said
it
was
your
tummy?!?"
[E]
"Oh,
I
mean
it
is,
but
I
also
got
a
bum
knee!"
[N]
"Mr.
Mathers,
the
fun
and
games
are
over.
And
just
for
that
stunt,
you're
gonna
get
some
extra
homework."
[E]
"But
don't
you
wanna
give
me
after
school
detention?"
[N]
"Nah,
that
bully
wants
to
beat
your
ass
and
I'ma
let
him."

Way
before
my
baby
daughter
Hailey
I
was
harassed
daily
by
this
fat
kid
named
D'Angelo
Bailey
An
eighth
grader
who
acted
obnoxious,
cause
his
father
boxes
so
everyday
he'd
shove
me
in
the
lockers
One
day
he
came
in
the
bathroom
while
I
was
pissin
And
had
me
in
the
position
to
beat
me
into
submission
He
banged
my
head
against
the
urinal
til
he
broke
my
nose,
Soaked
my
clothes
in
blood,
grabbed
me
and
choked
my
throat
I
tried
to
plead
and
tell
him,
"We
shouldn't
beef"
But
he
just
wouldn't
leave,
he
kept
chokin
me
and
I
couldn't
breathe
He
looked
at
me
and
said,
"You
gonna
die
honkey!"
The
principal
walked
in
(What's
going
on
in
here?)
and
started
helpin
him
stomp
me
I
made
them
think
they
beat
me
to
death
Holdin
my
breath
for
like
five
minutes
before
they
finally
left
Then
I
got
up
and
ran
to
the
janitor's
storage
booth
Kicked
the
door
hinge
loose
and
ripped
out
the
four
inch
screws
Grabbed
some
sharp
objects,
brooms,
and
foreign
tools
"This
is
for
every
time
you
took
my
orange
juice,
or
stole
my
seat
in
the
lunchroom
and
drank
my
chocolate
milk.
Every
time
you
tipped
my
tray
and
it
dropped
and
spilt.
I'm
gettin
you
back
bully!
Now
once
and
for
good."
I
cocked
the
broomstick
back
and
swung
hard
as
I
could
and
beat
him
over
the
head
with
it
til
I
broke
the
wood
Knocked
him
down,
stood
on
his
chest
with
one
foot..
..
Made
it
home,
later
that
same
day
Started
reading
a
comic,
and
suddenly
everything
became
gray
I
couldn't
even
see
what
I
was
tryin
to
read
I
went
deaf,
and
my
left
ear
started
to
bleed
My
mother
started
screamin,
"What
are
you
on,
drugs?!?
Look
at
you,
you're
gettin
blood
all
over
my
rug!"
(Sorry!)
She
beat
me
over
the
head
with
the
remote
control
opened
a
hole,
and
my
whole
brain
fell
out
of
my
skull
I
picked
it
up
and
screamed,
"Look
bitch,
what
have
you
done?!?"
[M]
"Oh
my
God,
I'm
sorry
son"
[E]
"Shut
up
you
cunt!"
I
said,
"Fuck
it!"
Took
it
and
stuck
it
back
up
in
my
head
then
I
sewed
it
shut
and
put
a
couple
of
screws
in
my
neck
Brain
damage,
ever
since
the
day
I
was
born
Drugs
is
what
they
used
to
say
I
was
on
They
say
I
never
knew
which
way
I
was
goin
But
everywhere
I
go
they
keep
playin
my
song
Brain
damage..
It's
brain
damage..
I
got
brain
damage..
It's
brain
damage..
It's
probably
brain
damage..
It's

Hey,
what's
going
on,
this
is
Paul
Rosenberg,
attorney
of
law.
Listen,
I
listened
to
the
rough
copy
of
your
album
And
uh,
you
know
I've
just
got
to
be
honest
with
you
Can
you
tone
it
down
a
little
bit?
Because
there's
only
so
much
I
can
explain.
Give
me
a
call
Life..
by
Marshall
Mathers
What
is
life?
Life
is
like
a
big
obstacle
put
in
front
of
your
optical
to
slow
you
down
And
everytime
you
think
you
gotten
past
it
it's
gonna
come
back
around
and
tackle
you
to
the
damn
ground
What
are
friends?
Friends
are
people
that
you
think
are
your
friends
But
they
really
your
enemies,
with
secret
indentities
and
disguises,
to
hide
they
true
colors
So
just
when
you
think
you
close
enough
to
be
brothers
they
wanna
come
back
and
cut
your
throat
when
you
ain't
lookin
What
is
money?
Money
is
what
makes
a
man
act
funny
Money
is
the
root
of
all
evil
Money'll
make
them
same
friends
come
back
around
swearing
that
they
was
always
down
What
is
life?
I'm
tired
of
life
I'm
tired
of
backstabbing
ass
snakes
with
friendly

I'm
tired
of
committing
so
many
sins
Tired

always
giving
in
when
this

Tired

I'm
tired
of

Tired

Tired

But
if

dollars
I'd

If

a
magic
wand,
I'd
make
the
world
suck
my
dick
without
a
condom
on,
while
I'm
on
the
john
If
I
had
a
million
bucks
it
wouldn't
be

because
I'd
still
be
out
robbing
armored
trucks
If
I

I
would
ask
for
a

ass
for

I'm

I'm
tired
of

Having
a

and

Tired

Tired
of

in
clubs
wearing
the

Tired
of

Tired
of

You

I'm

Telling

How'm

Oh

She?s

Oh

Now
I

---it's

But
you
know
your
mama,
she?s
one
of
those
type
of
women
That

crazy
things,
and
if
she
don't

she?ll
throw
a
fit
Don't
play
with
Da-da?s
toy
knife,
honey,

And

bashful?
Don't

help
Da-da
build
a
sand
castle?
(yeah!)
And
Mama
said
she
wants
to
show
how
far
she
can
float
And
don't
worry
about
that
little
boo-boo
on
her
throat
It's
just
a
little
scratch
?it

While

and

Verse

See,
honey?
there?s
a
place
called
heaven
and
a
place
called
hell
A
place
called
prison
and
e
place
called
jail
And
Da-da?s
probably
on
his
way
to
all
of
?em
except
one
?Cause
Mama?s
got
a
new
husband
and
a
stepson
And
you
don't
want
a
brother
do
ya?
(Nah)
Maybe
when
you're
old
enough
to
understand
a
little
better
I'll
explain
it
to
ya
But
for
now
we?ll
just
say
Mama
was
real
real
bad
She
was
bein?
mean
to
Dad
and
made
him
real
real
mad
But
I
still
feel
sad
that
I
put
her
on
time-out
Sit
back
in
your
chair,
honey
quit
tryin?
to
climb
out
(Wahh!)
I

you
it's

Hai-Hai,

Take

night-night?
Nan-a-boo,

Da-da

dia-dee
Clean
the
baby
up
so
her
can
take
a
nighty-nighty
And
Dad?ll
wake
her
up
as
soon
as
we
get
to
the
water
Ninety-seven

Just

Baby,

the
wrong
idea
Mama?s
too
sweepy
to
hear
you

in
her

(Ma-maa!)
That?s
why
you

get
her

Da-da

Outro:
Just

world
Just

and

Your

there
for
you
Your
da-da?s
always
gonna
love
you
Remember
that
If
you
ever
need
me
I
will
always
be
here
for
you
If
you
ever
need
anything,
just
ask
Da-da
will
be
right
there
Your
da-da
loves
you
I
love
you,
baby
Justin?
It's
Zoe.
Kelly
did
not
have
me
call,
however
I
just
listened
to
Eminem
in
her
car
and
it
is
the
most
disgusting
thing
I
have
ever
heard
in
my
entire
life.
And
I
seriously
wanna
call
his
fucking
agent
And
tell
him
how
fucking
disgusting
he
is
It,
like,
makes
me
upset
and
I'm
now
nausious
and
I
can't
eat
lunch.
Goodbye
OK,
I'm
going
to
attempt
to
drown
myself
You
can
try
this
at
home
You
can
be
just
like
me!
Mic
check
one
two..
we
recordin?
I'm
cancerous,
so
when
I
diss
you
wouldn't
wanna
answer
this
If
you
responded
back
with
a
battle
rap
you
wrote
for
Canibus
I
strangled
you
to
death
then
I
choked
you
again
Then
break
your
fuckin
legs
till
your
bones
poke
through
your
skin
You
beef
wit
me,
I'ma
even
the
score
equally
Take
you
on
Jerry
Springer,
and
beat
yer
ass
legally
I
get
you
blunted
off
of
funny
home
grown
Cause
when
I
smoke
out
I
hit
the
trees
harder
than
Sonny
Bono
(Ohh
no!!)
So
if
I
said
I
never
did
drugs
That
would
mean
I
lie
AND
get
fucked
more
than
the
President
does
Hillary
Clinton
tried
to
slap
me
and
call
me
a
pervert
I
ripped
her
fuckin
tonsils
out
and
fed
her
sherbet
(Bitch!)
My
nerves
hurt,
and
lately
I'm
on
edge
Grabbed
Vanilla
Ice
and
ripped
out
his
blonde
dreads
(Fuck
you!)
Every
girl
I
ever
went
out
wit
is
goin
lez
Follow
me
and
do
exactly
what
the
song
says:
smoke
weed,
take
pills,
drop
outta
school,
kill
people
and
drink
And
jump
behind
the
wheel
like
it
was
still
legal
I'm
dumb
enough
to
walk
in
a
store
and
steal
So
I'm
dumb
enough
to
ask
for
a
date
with
Lauryn
Hill
Some
people
only
see
that
I'm
white,
ignorin
skill
Cause
I
stand
out
like
a
green
hat
with
a
orange
bill
But
I
don't
get
pissed,
y'all
don't
even
see
through
the
mist
How
the
fuck
can
I
be
white,
I
don't
even
exist
I
get
a
clean
shave,
bathe,
go
to
a
rave
Die
from
an
overdose
and
dig
myself
up
out
of
my
grave
My
middle
finger
won't
go
down,
how
do
I
wave?
And
this
is
how
I'm
supposed
to
teach
kids
how
to
behave?
Now
follow
me
and
do
exactly
what
you
see
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!
I
slap
women
and
eat
shrooms
then
O.D.
Now
don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!
Me
and
Marcus
Allen
went
over
to
see
Nicole
When
we
heard
a
knock
at
the
door,
must
have
been
Ron
Gold'
Jumped
behind
the
door,
put
the
orgy
on
hold
Killed
em
both
and
smeared
blood
in
a
white
Bronco
(we
did
it!)
My
mind
won't
work
if
my
spine
don't
jerk
I
slapped
Garth
Brooks
out
of
his
Rhinestone
shirt
I'm
not
a
player
just
a
ill
rhyme
sayer
That'll
spray
an
Aerosol
can
up
at
the
ozone
layer
(psssssssh)
My
rap
style's
warped,
I'm
runnin
out
the
morgue
witcha
dead
grandmother's
corpse
to
throw
it
on
your
porch
Jumped
in
a
Chickenhawk
cartoon
wit
a
cape
on
And
beat
up
Foghorn
Leghorn
with
an
acorn
I'm
bout
as
normal
as
Norman
Bates,
with
deformative
traits
A
premature
birth
that
was
four
minutes
late
Mother..
are
you
there?
I
love
you
I
never
meant
to
hit
you
over
the
head
with
that
shovel
Will
someone
explain
to
my
brain
that
I
just
severed
a
main
vein
with
a
chainsaw
and
I'm
in
pain?
I
take
a
breather
and
sighed;
either
I'm
high,
or
I'm
nuts
Cause
if
you
ain't
tiltin
this
room,
neither
am
I
So
when
you
see
your
mom
with
a
thermometer
shoved
in
her
ass
Then
it
probably
is
obvious
I
got
it
on
with
her
Cause
when
I
drop
this
solo
shit
it's
over
with
I
bought
Cage's
tape,
opened
it,
and
dubbed
over
it
I
came
to
the
club
drunk
with
a
fake
ID
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!
I've
been
with
10
women
who
got
HIV
Now
don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!
I
got
genital
warts
and
it
burns
when
I
pee
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!
I
tie
a
rope
around
my
penis
and
jump
from
a
tree
You
probably
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!!!
This

C'mere,

"Who's

[Em]
Aight,

turn
my
headphones
up
(bust

bust

[Eminem]
My
favoite
color
is
red,
like
the
blood
shed
from
Kurt
Cobain's
head,
when
he
shot
himself
dead
Women
all
grabbin
at
my
shishkabob
Bought
Lauryn
Hill's
tape
so
her
kids
could
starve
(I
can't
stand
white
people!)
You
thought
I
was
livid,
now
I'm
even
more
so
Shit
I
got
full
blown
AIDS
and
a
sore
throat
I
got
a
wardrobe
with
an
orange
robe
{*wolf
whistle*}
I'm
in
the
fourth
row,
signin
autographs
at
your
show
(Yo
can
you
sign
this
right
here?)
I
just
remembered
that
I'm
absent
minded
Wait,
I
mean
I've
lost
my
mind,
I
can't
find
it
I'm
freestylin
every
verse
that
I
spit
cause
I
don't
even
remember
the
words
to
my
shit
(umm,
one
two)
I
told
the
doc
I
need
a
change
in
sickness
and
gave
a
girl
herpes
in
exchange
for
syphilis
Put
my
LP
on
your
Christmas
gift
list
You
wanna
get
high,
here
bitch
just
sniff
this
Cum

(8X)
[Eminem]
Yo..
yo
yo
yo
yo
I
tried
suicide
once
and
I'll
try
it
again
That's
why
I
write
songs
where
I
die
at
the
end
Cause
I
don't
give
a
fuck,
like
my
middle
finger
was
stuck
and
I
was
wavin
it
at
everybody
screamin,
"I
suck"
(I
SUCK!!!)
I
go
on
stage
in
front
of
a
sellout
crowd
and
yell
out
loud,
"All
y'all
get
the
hell
out
now"
Fuck
rap,
I'm
givin
it
up
y'all,
I'm
sorry
(But
Eminem
this
is
your
record
release
party!)
I'm
bored
out
of
my
gourd
--
so
I
took
a
hammer
and
nailed
my
foot
to
the
floorboard
of
my
Ford
Guess
I'm
just
a
sick
sick
bastard
who's
one
sandwich
short
of
a
picnic
basket
(I
ain't
got
it
all)
One
Excederin
tablet
short
of
a
full
medicine
cabinet
I
feel
like
my
head
has
been
shredded
like
lettuce
and
cabbage
(ohhhhhhh)
And
if
you
ever
see
a
video
for
this
shit
I'll
probably
be
dressed
up
like
a
mummy
with
my
wrists
slit
Cum
on
everybody
--
get
down
tonight
(8X)
[Eminem]
Got
bitches
on
my
jock
out
in
East
Detroit
Cause
they
think
that
I'm
a
motherfuckin
Beastie
Boy
{*wolf
whistle*}
So
I
told
em
I
was
Mike
D
They
was
like,
"Gee
I
don't
know,
he
might
be!"
I
told
em,
"Meet
me
at
Kid
Rock's
next
concert
I'll
be
standin
by
the
Loch
Ness
Monster
(okay)
peace
out
(bye!!)"
Then
I
jetted
to
the
weed
house
Smoked
out
til
I
started
bustin
freestyles
Broke
out
then
I
dipped
quick
back
to
the
crib,
put
on
lipstick
Crushed
up
the
Tylenol
and
ate
it
with
a
dipstick
(*slurping*}
Made
a
couple
of
crank
calls
collect
[*brrrrrrring,
click*]
"Ken
Kaniff
from
Connecticut,
can
you
accept?"
I
wanna
make
songs
all
the
fellas
dub
And
murder
every
rich
rapper
that
I'm
jealous
of
So
just
remember
when
I
bomb
your
set
Yo,
I
only
cuss
to
make
your
mom
upset
Cum
on
everybody
--
get
down
tonight
(20X)
Ah
yeah,
yo!
This
song
is
dedicated
to
all
the
happy
people
All
the
happy
people
who
have
real
nice
lives
And
who
have
no
idea
whats
it
like
to
be
broke
as
fuck
Verse
One:
I
feel
like
I'm
walking
a
tight
rope,
without
a
circus
net
I'm
popping
perkasets,
I'm
a
nervous
wreck
I
deserve
respect;
but
I
work
a
sweat
for
this
worthless
check
Bout
to
burst
this
tech,
at
somebody
to
reverse
this
debt
Minimum
wage
got
my
adrenaline
caged
Full
of
venom
and
rage
Especially
when
I'm
engaged
And
my
daughter's
down
to
her
last
diaper
That's
got
my
ass
hyper
I
pray
that
god
answers,
maybe
I'll
ask
nicer
Watching
ballers
while
they
flossing
in
their
pathfinders
These
overnight
stars
becoming
autograph
signers
We'll
all
gone
blow
up
and
leave
the
past
behind
us
Along
with
the
small
fry's
and
average
half
pinters
While
playa
haters
turn
bitch
like
they
have
vaginas
Cause
we
see
them
dollar
signs
and
let
the
cash
blind
us
Money
will
brainwash
you
and
leave
your
ass
mindless
Snakes
slither
in
the
grass
spineless
Chorus:
repeat
2X
That's
Rock
Bottom
When
this
life
makes
you
mad
enough
to
kill
That's
Rock
Bottom
When
you
want
something
bad
enough
you'll
steal
That's
Rock
Bottom
When
you
feel
you
have
had
it
up
to
here
Cause
you
mad
enough
to
scream
but
you
sad
enough
to
tear
Verse
Two:
My
life
is
full
of
empty
promises
And
broken
dreams
I'm
hoping
things
will
look
up
But
there
ain't
no
job
openings
I
feel
discouraged
hungry
and
malnourished
Living
in
this
house
with
no
furnace,
unfurnished
And
I'm
sick
of
working
dead
end
jobs
with
lame
pay
And
I'm
tired
of
being
hired
and
fired
the
same
day
But
fuck
it,
if
you
know
the
rules
to
the
game
play
Cause
when
we
die
we
know
were
all
going
the
same
way
It's
cool
to
be
player,
but
it
sucks
to
be
the
fan
When
all
you
need
is
bucks
to
be
the
man
Plus
a
luxury
sedan
Too
comfortable
and
roomy
in
a
six
They
threw
me
in
the
mix
With
all
these
gloomy
lunatics
Walk
around
depressed
And
smoke
a
pound
of
ses
a
day
And
yesterday
went
by
so
quick
it
seems
like
it
was
just
today
My
daughter
wants
to
throw
the
ball
but
I'm
too
stressed
to
play
Live
half
my
life
and
throw
the
rest
away
Chorus
There's
people
that
love
me
and
people
that
hate
me
But
it's
the
evil
that
made
me
this
backstabbing,
deceitful,
and
shady
I
want
the
money,
the
women,
the
fortune,
and
the
fame
That
Means
I'll
end
up
burning
in
hell
scorching
in
flames
That
means
I'm
stealing
your
checkbook
and
forging
your
name
Lifetime
bliss
for
eternal
torture
and
pain
Right
now
I
feel
like
just
hit
the
rock
bottom
I
got
problems
now
everybody
on
my
blocks
got
'em
I'm
screaming
like
those
two
cops
when
2pac
shot
'em
Holding
two
glocks,
I
hope
your
doors
got
new
locks
on
'em
My
daughter's
feet
ain't
got
no
shoes
or
sock's
on
'em
And
them
rings
you
wearing
look
like
they
got
a
few
rocks
on
'em
And
while
you
flaunting
them
I
could
be
taking
them
to
shops
to
pawn
them
I
got
a
couple
of
rings
and
a
brand
new
watch
you
want
'em?
Cause
I
never
went
gold
of
one
song
I'm
running
up
on
someone's
lawns
with
guns
drawn
Chorus
Intro:
Frogg
Whoah!
A
get
your
hands
in
the
air,
and
get
to
clappin
'em
and
like,
back
and
forth
because
ah
this
is..
what
you
thought
it
wasn't
It
beez..
the
brothers
representin'
the
Dirty
Dozen
I
be
the
F-R-O
the
double
G
*coughing
in

And
check
out
the
man
he
goes
by
the
name
of

You

Admit

while

I'm

then
My

Marshall
Mathers,
I'm
an
alcoholic
(Hi
Marshall)
I
have
a
disease
and
they
don't
know
what
to
call
it
Better
hide
your
wallet
cause
I'm
comin
up
quick
to
strip
your
cash
Bought
a
ticket
to
your
concert
just
to
come
and
whip
your
ass
Bitch,
I'm
comin
out
swingin,
so
fast
it'll
make
your
eyes
spin
You
gettin
knocked
the
fuck
out
like
Mike
Tyson
The
+Proof+

in
the
puddin,
just
ask
the
Deshaun
Holton
I'll
slit
your
motherfuckin
throat
worse
than
Ron
Goldman
Chorus:
So
when
you
see
me
on
your
block
with
two
glocks
Screamin
_Fuck
the
World_
like
Tupac
I
just
don't
give
a
fuuuuuck!!
Talkin
that
shit
behind
my
back,
dirty
mackin
tellin
your
boys
that
I'm
on
crack
I
just
don't
give
a

So
put
my
tape
back
on
the
rack
Go
run
and
tell
your
friends
my
shit
is
wack
I
just
don't
give
a
fuuuuuck!!
But
see
me
on
the
street
and
duck
Cause
you

get
stuck,
stoned,
and
snuffed
Cause
I
just
don't
give
a
fuuuuuck!!
Verse
Two:
Eminem
I'm
Nicer
than
Pete,
but
I'm
on
a
Serch
to
crush
a
Miilkbone
I'm
Everlast-ing,
I
melt
Vanilla
Ice
like
silicone
I'm
ill
enough
to
just
straight
up
diss
you
for
no
reason
I'm
colder
than
snow
season
when
it's
twenty
below
freezin
Flavor
with
no
seasonin,
this
is
the
sneak
preview
I'll
diss
your
magazine
and
still
won't
get
a
weak
review
I'll
make
your
freak
leave
you,
smell
the
Folgers
crystals
This
is
a
lyrical
combat,
gentlemen
hold
your
pistols
But
I
form
like
Voltron
and
blast
you
with
my
shoulder
missiles
Slim
Shady,
Eminem
was
the
old
initials
(Bye-bye!)
Extortion,
snortin,
supportin
abortion
Pathological
liar,
blowin
shit
out
of
proportion
The
looniest,
zaniest,
spontaneous,
sporadic
Impulsive

compulsive
drinker,

Half

Dumpin
your

With
more

than
an
Afghan
Chorus
Verse
Three:
Eminem
Somebody
let
me
out
this
limousine
(hey,
let
me
out!)
I'm
a
caged
demon,
on
stage
screamin
like
Rage
Against
the
Machine
I'm
convinced
I'm
a
fiend,
shootin
up
while
this
record
is
spinnin
Clinically
brain
dead,
I
don't
need
a
second
opinion
Fuck
droppin
the
jewel,
I'm
flippin
the
sacred
treasure
I'll
bite
your
motherfuckin
style,
just
to
make
it
fresher
I
can't
take
the
pressure,
I'm
sick
of
bitches
Sick
of
naggin
bosses
bitchin
while
I'm
washin
dishes
In
school
I
never
said
much,
too
busy
havin
a
headrush
Doin
too
much
rush
had
my
face
flushed
like
red
blush
Then
I
went
to
Jim
Beam,
that's
when
my
face
grayed
Went
to
gym
in
eighth
grade,
raped
the
women's
swim
team
Don't
take
me
for
a
joke
I'm
no
comedian
Too
many
mental
problems
got
me
snortin
coke
and
smokin
weed
again
I'm
goin
up
over
the
curb,
drivin
on
the
median
Finally
made
it
home,
but
I
don't
got
the
key
to
get
in
Chorus
Outro:

Skylar

What
do
you
want
from
me
Roger?
I
know
it
was
you
all
along
messing
around
with
my
dear
Veronica.
Wait
a
minute.
You
hold
it
right
there.
Me
and
that
woman
love
each
other.
Love?
What
do
you
know
of
love?
We
were
destined
to
be
together.
I
met
her
on
the
beach...
Are
you
out
to
destroy
me?
No,
Roger.
That's
not
what
I
want
to
do.
I
love
her!
And
we're
gonna
be
together,
never.
Chorus:
Repeat
2X
I
dont
know
why
this
world
keep
turning
Round
and
Round
But
I
wish
it
would
stop,
and
let
me
off
right
now
Yes
man
As
the
World
Turns
We
all
experience
things
in
life
Trials
and
Tribulations
That
we
all
must
go
through
When
someone
wants
to
test
us
When
someone
tries
our
patience
[Eminem]
I
hang
with
a
bunch
of
hippies
and
wacky
tobacco
planters
Who
swallow
lit
roaches
and
light
up
like
jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders
baby,
and
we
suing
the
courts
Cuz
we're
dope
as
fuck
and
only
get
a
2
in
the
source
They
never
should've
booted
me
out
of
reform
school
Deformed
fool,takin
a
shit
in
a
warm
pool
They
threw
me
out
the
Ramada
Inn
I
said
it
wasn't
me,
I
got
a
twin
(Oh
my
god
its
you!
Not
again!)
It
all
started
when
my
mother
took
my
bike
away
Cuz
I
murdered
my
guinea
pig
and
stuck
him
in
the
microwave
After
that,
It
was
straight
to
the
40
ouncers
Slappin
teachers,
and
jackin
off
in
front
of
my
counselors
Class
clown
freshman,
dressed
like
Les
Nessman
Fuck
the
next
lesson,
I'll
past
the
test
guessin
And
all
the
other
kids
said
Eminem's
a
dishead,
He'll
never
last,
the
only
class
he'll
pass
is
phys
ed
May
be
true,
till
I
told
this
bitch
in
gym
class
That
she
was
too
fat
to
swim
laps,
she
needed
Slim
Fast
(Who
Me?)
Yeah
bitch
you
so
big
you
walked
into
big
Tanny's
and
stepped
on
Jenny
Craig
She
picked
me
up
to
snap
me
like
a
skinny
twig
Put
me
in
the
headlock,
then
I
thought
of
my
guinea
pig
I
felt
the
evilness
and
started
transformin
(RARRRR!)
It
began
storming,
I
heard
a
bunch
of
cheering
fans
swarming
Grabbed
that
bitch
by
her
hair
Drug
her
across
the
ground
And
took
her
up
to
the
highest
diving
board
and
tossed
her
down
Sorry
coach,
its
too
late
to
tell
me
stop
While
I
drop
this
bitch
face
down
and
watch
her
belly
flop
Chorus
As
the
World
Turns
These
are
the
days
of
our
lives
These
are
the
things
that
we
must
go
through
Day
by
day
[Eminem]
We
drive
around
in
million
dollar
sports
cars
While
little
kids
hide
this
tape
from
their
parents
like
bad
report
cards
Outsiders,
and
we
suing
the
courts
Cuz
we
dope
as
fuck
and
only
get
a
2
in
The
Source
Hypercondriac,
hanging
out
at
the
laundromat
Where
all
the
raunchy
fat
white
trashy
blondes
be
at
Dressed
like
a
sailor,
standin
by
a
pale
of
garbage
Its
almost
dark
and
I'm
still
tryna
nail
a
trailor
park
bitch
I
met
a
slut
and
said
"What
up,
its
nice
to
meet
ya"
I'd
like
to
treat
ya
to
a
Faygo
and
a
slice
of
pizza
But
I'm
broke
as
fuck
and
I
don't
get
paid
till
the
first
of
next
month
But
if
you
care
to
join
me,
I
was
bout
to
roll
this
next
blunt
But
I
aint
got
no
weed,
no
phillies,
or
no
papers
Plus
I'm
a
rapist
and
a
repeated
prison
escapist
So
gimme
all
your
money
And
don't
try
nothin
funny
Cuz
you
know
your
stinkin
ass
is
too
fat
to
try
to
outrun
me
I
went
to
grab
my
gun
Thats
when
her
ass
put
it
on
me
Wit
an
uppercut
and
hit
me
with
a
basket
of
laundry
I
fell
through
the
glass
doors
Started
causin
a
scene
Then
slid
across
the
floor
and
flew
right
into
a
washin
machine
Jumped
up
with
a
broken
back
Thank
god
I
was
smokin
crack
all
day
And
doped
up
off
coke
and
smack
All
I
wanted
to
do
was
rape
the
bitch
and
snatch
her
purse
Now
I
wanna
kill
her
But
so
I
gotta
catch
her
first
Ran
through
Rally's
parkin
lot
and
took
a
shortcut
Saw
the
house
she
ran
up
in
And
shot
her
fuckin
porch
up
Kicked
the
door
down
to
murder
this
divorced
slut
Looked
around
the
room
Thats
when
I
seen
the
bedroom
door
shut
I
know
you're
in
there
bitch!
I
got
my
gun
cocked!
You
might
as
well
come
out
now
She
said
"Come
in,
its
unlocked!"
I
walked
in
and
all
I
smelled
was
Liz
Claiborne
And
seen
her
spread
across
the
bed
naked
watchin
gay
porn
She
said
"Come
her
big
boy,
lets
get
acquainted"
I
turned
around
to
run,
twisted
my
ankle
and
sprained
it
She
came
at
me
at
full
speed,
nothin
could
stop
her
I
shot
her
five
times
and
every
bullet
bounced
off
her
I
started
to
beg
"No,
please
let
go"
But
she
swallowed
my
fuckin
leg
whole
like
an
egg
roll
With
one
leg
left,
now
I'm
hoppin
around
crippled
I
grabbed
my
pocket
knife
and
sliced
off
her
right
nipple
Just
trying
to
buy
me
some
time,
then
I
remembered
this
magic
trick
Den
Den
Den
Den
Den
Den,
Go
go
gadget
dick!
Whipped
that
shit
out,
and
aint
no
doubt
about
it
It
hit
the
ground
and
caused
an
earthquake
and
power
outage
I
shouted
"Now
bitch,
lets
see
who
gets
the
best!"
Stuffed
that
shit
in
crooked
and
fucked
that
fat
slut
to
death
(Ahh!!
Ahhh!)
Come
here
bitch!
Come
here!
Take
this
motherfuckin
dick!
Bitch,
come
here!
Chorus
to
fade
And
as
we
go
along
Throughout
the
days
of
our
lives
We
all
face
small
obstacles
and
challenges
everyday
That
we
must
go
through
These
are
the
things
that
surround
us
through
our
atmosphere
Every
day
Every
single
day
the
world
keeps
turning
[Eminem]
Who
came
through
with
two
glocks
to
terrorize
your
borough
(huh?)
Told
you
how
to
slap
dicks
and
murder
your
girl
(I
did!)
Gave
you
all
the
finger
and
told
you
to
sit
and
twirl
Sold
a
billion
tapes
and
still
screamed,
"Fuck
the
world!"
(I'm
Slim
Shady..)
so
come
and
kill
me
while
my
name's
hot
And
shoot
me
twenty-five
times
in
the
same
spot
(Ow!)
I
think
I
got
a
generation
brainwashed
to
pop
pills
and
smoke
pot
til
they
brains
rot
(uhh-oh)
Stop
they
blood
flow
until
they
veins
clot
I
need
a
pain
shot,
and
a
shot
of
plain
scotch
Purple
haze
and
acid
raindrops
Spike
the
punch
at
the
party
and
drink
pop
(gulp
gulp)
Shaved
my
armpits
and
wore
a
tank
top
Bad
Boy,
I
told
you
that
I
can't
stop
You
gotta
make
em
fear
you
'fore
you
make
em
feel

So

my
shit
or
I'ma

I

mushrooms,
I
got
acid,
I
got
tabs
and
aspirin
tablets
I'm
your
brother
when
you

some
good
weed
to
set
you
free
You

me,
I'm
your
friend,

minithin
(I'm
Slim
Shady..)
I'm

[Eminem]
I
like
happy
things,
I'm
really
calm
and
peaceful
(uh-huh
huh)
I
like
birds,
bees,
I
like
people
I
like
funny
things
that
make
me
happy
and
gleeful
(hehehe)
like
when
my
teacher
sucked
my
wee-wee
in
preschool
(Woo!)
The
ill
type,
I
stab
myself
with
a
steel
spike
while
I
blow
my
brain
out,
just
to
see
what
it
feels
like
cause
this
is
how
I
am
in
real
life
(mm-hmm)
I
don't
want
to
just
die
a
normal
death,
I
wanna
be
killed
twice
(uh-huh)
How
you
gonna
scare
somebody
with
a
gun
threat
when
they
high
off
of
drugs
they
haven't
even
done
yet
(Huh?)
So

the
money
by
tonight
-
cause
your
wife
said
this
the
biggest
knife
she
ever
saw
in
her
life
(Help
me!
Help
me!)
I
try
to
keep
it
positive
and
play
it
cool
Shoot
up
the
playground
and
tell
the
kids
to
stay
in
school
(Stay
in
school!)
Cause
I'm
the
one
they
can
relate
to
and
look
up
to
better
Tonight
I
think
I'll

my
biggest
fan

[Eminem]
Yo..
I
listen
to
your
demo
tape
and
act

(Aww

Six

your
lyrics
on
my
shit
(What??
That's
my
shit!)
People
don't
buy
shit
no
more
they

dub
it
That's
why
I'm
still
broke
and
had
the
number
one
club
hit
(Yup,
uh
huh)
But
they
love
it
when
you
make
your
business
public
so
fuck

I've
got
herpes
while

And

Don't

[Intro]
[Cowboy]
I
reckon
you
ain't
familiar
with
these
here
parts
You
know,
there's
a
story
behind
that
there
saloon
Twenty
years
ago,
two
outlaws
took
this
whole
town
over
Sheriffs
couldn't
stop
em
Quickest
damn
gun
slingers
I've
ever
seen
Got
murdered
in
cold
blood
That
ol'
saloon
there
was
their
lil'
home
away
from
home
They
say
the
ghosts
of
Bad
and
Evil
still
live
in
that
tavern
And
on
a
quiet
night
You
can
still
hear
the
footsteps
of
Slim
Shady
and
Royce
Da
Five-Nine
[Eminem]
I
don't
speak,
I
float
in
the
air
wrapped
in
a
sheet
I'm
not
a
real
person,
I'm
a
ghost
trapped
in
a
beat
I
translate
when
my
voice
is
read
through
a
sismograph
And
a
noise
is
bred,
picked
up
and
transmitted
through
Royce's
head
(AAHHH)
Trapped
him
in
his
room,
possessed
him
and
hoist
his
bed
Till
the
evilness
flows
through
his
blood
like
poisonous
lead
Told
him
each
one
of
his
boys
is
dead
I
asked
him
to
come
to
the
dark
side,
he
made
a
choice
and
said
[Royce]
Who
hard?
yo
I
done
heard
worse
We
can
get
in
two
cars
and
accelerate
at
each
other
To
see
which
one'll
swerve
first
Two
blind
bandits
panic,
whose
mental
capacity
holds
That
of
a
globe
on
top
of
nine
other
planets
Kissed
the
cheek
of
the
devil
Intelligence
level
is
hell-ier
than
treble
peakin
on
speakers
in
the
ghetto
Dismissal,
I'm
not
a
fair
man,
disgraced
the
race
of
a
atheist
Intercepting
missles
wit
my
bare
hands
like
a
patriot
One
track
sliced
without
swords,
I
buried
the
Christ
corpse
In
my
past
life
when
the
Black
Knight
mounted
the
white
horse
And
stay
over-worked,
its
like
the
Nazis
in
the
nations
Collaborating,
attemptin
to
take
over
the
earth
[Eminem]
Cuz
this
is
what
happens
when
Bad
Meets
Evil
We
hit
the
trees
till
we
look
like
Vietnamese
people
He's
Evil,
and
I'm
Bad
like
Steve
Segal
Above
the
Law
cuz
I
don't
agree
wit
police
either
(shit,
me
neither)
We
ain't
eager
to
be
legal
So
please
leave
me
wit
the
keys
to
your
Jeep
Eagle
I
breathe
ether
in
three
amounts
When
I
stab
myself
in
the
knee
with
a
diseased
needle
Releasin
rage
on
anybody
in
squeezing
range
Cold
enough
to
make
the
seasons
change
into
freezing
rain
(He's
insane)
No
I'm
not,
I
just
want
to
shoot
up
and
I'm
pissed
off
Cuz
I
can't
find
a
decent
vain
[Royce]
The
disaster
wit
dreds
I'm
Bad
enough
to
commit
suicide
and
survive
long
enough
To
kill
my
soul
after
I'm
dead
When
in
danger
it's
funny
actually
my
flavor's
similar
to
a
waiter
Cuz
I
serve
any
stranger
wit
money
I
spray
a
hundred,
man
until
they
joint
chains
While
slippin
bullets
at
point
blank
range
like
they
was
punches
Piss
on
a
flag
and
burn
it,
murder
you
then
come
to
your
funeral
Serve
this
lobbyist,
strangle
your
body
then
confirm
you
Whippin
human
ass,
throwin
blows
crackin
jaws
Wit
my
fists
wrapped
in
gause,
dipped
in
glue
and
glass
I'm
blazin
MC's,
at
the
same
time
amazin
MC's
Somehow
MC's
ain't
that
eye-brow
raisin
to
me
From
all
of
angles
of
us,
flash
a
mack
loud
enough
to
cast
a
avalanche
And
bust
till
volcanoes
errupt
[interlude]
*phone
rings*
Hello?
(Billy)
Aiyyo
what's
up
(we're
comin
to
get
you)
STOP,
THEY
KNOW
IT'S
US!!
[Eminem]
I
used
to
be
a
loudmouth,
remember
me?
(uh-ah)
I'm
the
one
who
burned
your
house
down
(oh)
Well
I'm
out
now
(shit),
and
this
time
I'm
comin
back
to
blow
your
house
up
And
I
ain't
gon
leave
you
a
window
to
jump
out
of
Give
me
two
fat
tabs
and
three
shrooms
And
you
won't
see
me
like
fat
people
in
steam
rooms
And
when
I
go
to
hell
and
I'm
gettin
ready
to
leave
I'ma
put
air
in
a
bag
and
charge
people
to
breathe
[Royce]
(Eminem)
Cuz
this
is
what
happens
when
Bad
Meets
Evil
And
we
hit
the
trees
till
we
look
like
Vietnamese
people
He's
Evil,
and
I'm
Bad
like
Steve
Segal
Against
peaceful,
see
you
in
hell
for
the
sequel
(We'll
be
waitin)
See
you
in
hell
Wall
Street,
Royce
Da
Five-Nine,
Slim
Shady
See
you
in
hell
for
the
sequel
(bye
bye)
Bad
Meets
Evil,
what?
(till
next
time)
[Cowboy]
And
so
that's
the
story
when
Bad
Meets
Evil
Two
of
the
most
wanted
individuals
in
the
county
Made
Jesse
James
and
Billy
the
Kid
look
like
law-abiding
citizens
It's
too
bad
they
had
to
go
out
the
way
they
did
Got
shot
in
the
back
comin
out
of
that
ol'
saloon
But
their
spirits
still
live
on
till
this
day
Shhh...[spits]
wait,
did
y'all
hear
that?
[Footsteps
and
windblowing]
[Eminem]
A
lot
of
people
ask
me..
am
I
afraid
of
death..
Hell
yeah
I'm
afraid
of
death
I
don't
want
to
die
yet
A
lot
of
people
think..
that
I
worship
the
devil..
that
I
do
all
types
of..
retarded
shit
Look,
I
can't
change
the
way
I
think
And
I
can't
change
the
way
I
am
But
if
I
offended
you?
Good
Cause
I
still
don't
give
a
fuck
I'm
zonin
off
of
one
joint,
stoppin
a
limo
Hopped
in
the
window,
shoppin
a
demo
at
gunpoint
A
lyricist
without
a
clue,
what
year
is
this?
Fuck
a
needle,
here's
a
sword,
bodypierce
with
this
Livin
amuk,
never
givin
a
fuck
Gimme
the
keys
I'm
drunk,
and
I've
never
driven
a
truck
But
I
smoke
dope
in
a
cab
I'll
stab
you
with
the
sharpest
knife
I
can
grab
Come
back
the
next
week
and
re-open
your
scab
(YEAH!)
A
killer
instinct
runs
in
the
blood
Emptyin
full
clips
and
buryin
guns
in
the
mud
I've
calmed
down
now
--
I
was
heavy
once
into
drugs
I
could
walk
around
straight
for
two
months
with
a
buzz
My
brain's
gone,
my
soul's
worn
and
my
spirit
is
torn
The
rest
of
my
body's
still
bein
operated
on
I'm
ducked
the
fuck
down
while
I'm
writin
this
rhyme
Cause
I'm
probably
gonna
get
struck
with
lightnin
this
time
Chorus:
For
all
the
weed
that
I've
smoked
-
yo
this
blunt's
for
you
To
all
the
people
I've
offended
-
yeah
fuck
you
too!
To
all
the
friends
I
used
to
have
-
yo
I
miss
my
past
But
the
rest
of
you
assholes
can
KISS
MY
ASS
For
all
the
drugs
that
I've
done
-
yo
I'm
still
gon'
do
To
all
the
people
I've
offended
-
yeah
fuck
you
too!
For
everytime
I
reminisce
-
yo
I
miss
my
past
But
I
still
don't
give
a
fuck,
y'all
can
KISS
MY
ASS
[Eminem]
I
walked
into
a
gunfight
with
a
knife
to
kill
you
And
cut
you
so
fast
when
your
blood
spilled
it
was
still
blue
I'll
hang
you
til
you
dangle
and
chain
you
with
both
ankles
And
pull
you
apart
from
both
angles
I
wanna
crush
your
skull
til
your
brains
leaks
out
of
your
veins
And
bust
open
like
broken
water
mains
So
tell
Saddam
not
to
bother
with
makin
another
bomb
Cause
I'm
crushin
the
whole
world
in
my
palm
Got
your
girl
on
my
arm
and
I'm
armed
with
a
firearm
So
big
my
entire
arm
is
a
giant
firebomb
Buy
your
mom
a
shirt
with
a
Slim
Shady
iron-on
And
the
pants
to
match
("Here
momma
try
em
on")
I
get
imaginative
with
a
mouth
full
of
adjectives,
a
brain
full
of
adverbs,
and
a
box
full
of
laxatives
(Shittin
on
rappers)
Causin
hospital
accidents
God
help
me
before
I
commit
some
irresponsible
acts
again
Chorus
[Eminem]
I
wanted
an
album
so
rugged
nobody
could
touch
it
Spend
a
million
a
track
and
went
over
my
budget
(Ohh
shit!)
Now
how
in
the
fuck
am
I
supposed
to
get
out
of
debt?
I
can't
rap
anymore
-
I
just
murdered
the
alphabet
Drug
sickness
got
me
doin
some
bugged
twitches
I'm
withdrawn
from
crack
so
bad
my
blood
itches
I
don't
rap
to
get
the
women
-
fuck
bitches
Give
me
a
fat
slut
that
cooks
and
does
dishes
Never
ran
with
a
click
-
I'm
a
posse
Kamikaze,
strappin
a
motherfuckin
bomb
across
me
From
the
second
I
was
born,
my
momma
lost
me
I'm
a
cross
between
Manson,
Esham
and
Ozzy
I
don't
know
why
the
fuck
I'm
here
in
the
first
place
My
worst
day
on
this
earth
was
my
first
birthday
Retarded?
What

nurse
say?
Brain
damage?
Fuck,

*)
Ffff-fuck..
(My

My
nuts..
My
attitude
is
worse
than
NWA's
was
I'll
battle
you
over
stupid
shit
and
diss
people
who
ain't
have
shit
to
do
with
it,
like
Cool
J
does
(My
tattoo!)
You
see
me
standin
outside
of
your
buildin;
screamin,
"Puffy
is
good,
(HEY!)
but
Slim
Shady
is
for
the
children!"
(WAIT!)
I
look
at
my
life
in
a
new
light
--
fuck
it
Give
me
two
mics;
I
write
songs
for
me
--
fuck
what
you
like
You're
probably
hear
me
rap
half-hearted;
cause
I
don't
like
rap
anyway
I'm
just
tryin
to
get
my
porno
career
started
Every
place
and
event..
+Been

Study
these
5
chapters
Lesson
One:
Throw
demos
as
hard
as
you
can
at
signed
rappers
Lesson
Two:
Face
em
and
diss
em
(whattup
dog?)
Don't
give
em
a
demo;
kidnap
em
(I
want
you
to
come
with
me)
and
make
em
come
to
your
basement
and
listen
(you're
gonna
fuckin
check
this
out)
Lesson
Three:
Get
a
job
at
a
label;
switch
demos
with
Canibus
and
put
yours
on
the
owner's
table
(here
listen!)
Lesson
Four:
'Know
you
heard
this
before'
"Hey
let
me
get
your
number;
I'll
call
you
tomorrow,
for
sure!"
Don't
act
like
a
fan
--
you
wanna
get
signed?
Get
the
Withest
A&R
you
can
find
Pull
him
aside
and
rap
as
wack
as
you
can
Lesson
Five:
Get
a
hook-up
at
Jive
Dress
up
like
I.C.P.
and
have
them
come
see
you
perform
live
And
that's
the
key,
but
when
you
see
me
on
the
street;
I
ain't
givin
you
shit
bitch
-
don't
even
bother
askin
me
(get
away
from
me)
Toilet
water
splashes

right
in
the
ass
when
I'm

shittin
when
I'm

(UNNNGGGGH!)
Got

blowjob
from
Paula
Jones,
and
stuffed
it
so
far
in
her
mouth
my

of

collarbones
(OWW!)
Told

("It's
all

me..")
Gave
Alyssa
Milano
syphillis,
mono
and
gonorrhea
("You're

dick!")
And
all
three
of
my
main
girls
said
SEE-YA
Cause
Brandy
and
Monica
walked
in
and
caught
me
fuckin
Aaliyah
(What?
Oh
my
God!)
I
splish
splash
while
I'm
takin
a
bath
Grab
a
handful
of
pills,
break
em
in
half,
take
em
and
laugh
White
trash
--
fuckin
your
wife
in
the
ass
("Oh!
Ooh
Shady!
Oooh!")
While
you're
out
siphoning
gas
for
your
lawnmower
to
cut
the
grass
So
if
I
hurt
your
self-esteem
and
you
get
dissed
too
bad
[Yo
why
you
diss
me?]
You
know
I
just
be
sayin
that
to
get
you
mad
And
when
I
rap
about
a
buncha
shit
you
wished
you
had
[A
big
dick!]
You
know
I
just
be
sayin
that
to
get
you
mad
"I
can't
listen
to
that
song,
that
shit's
too
sad!"
You
know
I
just
be
sayin
that
to
get
you
mad
"He'll
never
make
it,
his
wrist
is
slit
too
bad!"
[Nurse!
Nurse!]
You
know
I
just
be
sayin
that
to
get
you
mad
What
a
wonderful
day;
I
should
go
outside
and
play
Ain't
no
need
to
sit
inside
the
house
and
hibernate
Hi
Renee!
(Oh
hi!)
I
was
just
about
to
toss
a
live
grenade
in
your
driveway
(WHAT?)
and
drive
away
(*
car
peels
out
*)
Are
you
afraid
of
a
blade
made
of
a
razor
with
AIDS
Blood
drippin
from
it,
rippin
your
stomach
like
a
paper
mache
You
talk
a
lotta
shit,
but
you
was
never
ill
though
I'm
sick
enough
to
beat
you
to
death
with
a
feather
pillow
Tipped
over
some
cows,
just
for
a
joke
and
a
laugh
(MOOOOO!)
Jumped
up,
choked
a
giraffe,
snapped
his
neck
and
broke
it
in
half
Wagin
wars,
went
on
stage
and
sprayed
Cage
with
+Agent
Orange+
And
wiped
my
ass
with
his

(Here!)
The
demon
is
here,
steamin
this
year
I
rip
[*Mystikal's*]
voicebox

his
ear
(AHHHHHH!)
It's
not
a
gimmick
bitch,
it's
an
image
I
live
it
Give
a
fuck?
I
don't
know
what
a
fuck
is
to
give
it
"Yeah
I
don't
think
this
guy
is
well.."
I'm
high
as
hell
I'll
beat
you
with
a
live
cat
when
I'm

him
by
his
tail
[*

I'll

Lay

nuts
on
the

Just

And

Cut

off
and
sew
your
head
right
back
And
leave
you

You
just
triggered
the

who
just

liquor
Who's

disfigured
and
stiffer
than
Chris-topher
Reeves,
I
was
teething
with
strep
throat
while
your
mother
was
breastfeeding
And
gave
her
the
flesh-eating
disease
I'm
iller
than
takin
a
hammer
and
beatin
your
knees
and
walkin
through
South
Central
L.A.,
bleedin
in
jeans
(Am
I
a
Blood
or
a
Crip?)
Wakin
up
the
next
day
in
breathin
machines
Flashin
back
to
being
shot
and
repeatin
the
scenes
on
how
you
just
got
smoked,
and
if
you
do
live
You'll
be
too
scared
to
tell
it,
like
a
Biggie
and
'Pac
joke
So
if
I
hurt
your
self-esteem
and
you
get
dissed
too
bad
You
know
I
just
be
sayin
that
to
get
you
mad
And
when
I
rap
about
a
fat
bitch
that
you
wished
you
had
You

sayin
that
to
get
you

"I

You

When

used
to

But
then
I
got

I

was
the

But

was
nothin

They

Got

Just
criminal
intent

sodomize
women
again
Eminem
offend?
NO!
Eminem
insult
And
if
you
ever
give

to
him,
you
give
him
an
impulse
to
do
it
again,
THEN,
if
he
does
it
again
you'll
probably
end
up
jumpin
out
of

(Ahhhhhhhh!)
Bitch
I'ma

Cause

And

I

TWEECE!

Whatever,

Dear
Slim,
I

but
you
still
ain't
callin
I
left
my
cell,
my
pager,
and
my
home
phone
at
the
bottom
I
sent
two
letters
back
in
autumn,
you
must
not-a
got
'em
There
probably
was
a
problem
at
the
post
office
or
somethin'
Sometimes
I
scribble
addresses
too
sloppy
when
I
jot
'em
but
anyways;
fuck
it,
what's
been
up?
Man
how's
your
daughter?
My
girlfriend's
pregnant
too,
I'm
bout
to
be
a
father
If
I
have
a
daughter,
guess
what
I'ma
call
her?
I'ma
name
her
Bonnie
I
read
about
your
Uncle
Ronnie
too
I'm
sorry
I
had
a
friend
kill
himself
over
some
bitch
who
didn't
want
him
I
know
you
probably
hear
this
everyday,
but
I'm
your
biggest
fan
I
even
got
the
underground
shit
that
you
did
with
Scam
I
got
a
room
full
of
your
posters
and
your
pictures
man
I
like
the
shit
you
did
with
Ruckus
too,
that
shit
was
fat
Anyways,
I
hope
you
get
this
man,
hit
me
back,
just
to
chat,
truly
yours,
your

This

Dear

I
hope
you
have
a

I
ain't
mad
-
I
just
think
it's
FUCKED
UP
you
don't
answer
fans
If
you
didn't
wanna
talk
to
me
outside
your
concert
you
didn't
have
to,
but
you
coulda
signed
an
autograph
for
Matthew
That's
my
little
brother
man,
he's
only
six
years
old
We
waited
in
the
blistering
cold
for
you
four
hours
and
you
just
said,
"No."
That's
pretty
shitty
man
-
you're
like
his
fuckin
idol
He
wants
to
be
just
like
you
man,
he
likes
you
more
than
I
do
I
ain't
that
mad
though,
I
just
don't
like
being
lied
to
Remember
when
we
met
in
Denver?
You
said
if
I'd
write
you,
you
would
write
back
See,
I'm
just
like
you
in
a
way;
I
never
knew
my
father
neither
He
used
to
always
cheat
on
my
mom
and
beat
her
I
can
relate
to
what
you're
saying
in
your
songs
So
when
I
have
a
shitty
day,
I
drift
away
and
put
'em
on
Cause
I
don't
really
got
shit
else
So
that
shit
helps
when
I'm
depressed
I
even
got
a
tattoo
of
your
name
across
the
chest
Sometimes
I
even
cut
myself
to
see
how
much
it
bleeds
It's
like
adrenaline,
the
pain
is
such
a
sudden
rush
for
me
See
everything
you
say
is
real
And
I
respect
you
cause
you
tell
it
My
girlfriend's
jealous
cause
I
talk
about
you
24/7
But
she
don't
know
you
like
I
know
you,
Slim,
no
one
does
She
don't
know
what
it
was
like
for
people
like
us
growin'
up
You
gotta
call
me,
man
I'll
be
the
biggest
fan
you'll
ever
lose,
sincerely
yours,
Stan
P.S.
We
should
be
together
too
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'll
all
be
gray,
but
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so
bad
Dear
Mr.
I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll
be
the
last
package
I
ever
send
your
ass
It's
been
six
months
and
still
no
word

I
don't
deserve
it?
I
know
you
got
my
last
two
letters
I
wrote
the
addresses
on
'em
perfect
So
this
is
my
cassette
I'm
sending
you,
I
hope
you
hear
it
I'm
in
the
car
right
now,
I'm
doing
90
on
the
freeway
Hey,
Slim,
I
drank
a
fifth
of
vodka,
you
dare
me
to
drive?
You
know
the
song
by
Phil
Collins
"In
the
Air
of
the
Night"
about
that
guy
who
could've
saved
that
other
guy
from
drownin'
But
didn't,
then
Phil
saw
it
all,
then
at
a
show
he
found
him?
That's
kinda
how
this
is
You
could've
rescued
me
from
drowning
Now
it's
too
late,
I'm
on
a
thousand
downers
now,
I'm
drowsy
And
all
I
wanted
was
a
lousy
letter
or
a
call
I
hope
you
know
I
ripped
all
of
your
pictures
off
the
wall
I
loved
you,
Slim,
we
could've
been
together

think
about
it!
You
ruined
it
now,
I
hope
you
can't
sleep
and
you
dream
about
it
And
when
you
dream
I
hope
you
can't
sleep
and
you
scream
about
it
I
hope
your
conscience
eats
at
you
and
you
can't
breathe
without
me
See,
Slim--shut
up,
bitch!
I'm
tryin'
to
talk
Hey,
Slim,
that's
my
girlfriend
screamin'
in
the
trunk
But
I
didn't
slit
her
throat,
I
just
tied
her
up,
see,
I
ain't
like
you
Cause
if
she
suffocates
she'll
suffer
more
And
then
she'll
die
too
Well,
gotta
go,
I'm
almost
at
the
bridge
now
Oh
shit,
I
forgot,
how
am
I
supposed
to
send
this
shit
out?
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'll
all
be
gray,
but
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so
bad
Dear,
Stan,
I
meant
to
write
you
sooner,
but
I
just
been
busy
You
said
your
girlfriend's
pregnant
now.
How
far
along
is
she?
Look,
I'm
really
flattered
you
would
call
your
daughter
that
And
here's
an
autograph
for
your
brother
I
wrote
it
on
a
Starter
cap
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
see
you
at
the
show,
I
must've
missed
you
Don't
think
I
did
that
shit
intentionally
just
to
diss
you
But
what's
this
shit
you
said
about
you
like
to
cut
your
wrists
too?
I
say
that
shit
just
clowning,
dawg
Come
on,
how
fucked
up
is
you?
You
got
some
issues,
Stan,
I
think
you
need
some
counselin'
To
help
your
ass
from
bouncin'
off
the
walls
When
you
get
down
some
And
what's
this
shit
about
us
meant
to
be
together?
That
type
of
shit'll
make
me
not
want
us
to
meet
each
other
I
really
think
you
and
your
girlfriend
need
each
other
Or
maybe
you
just
need
to
treat
her
better
I
hope
you
get
to
read
this
letter
I
just
hope
it
reaches
you
in
time
Before
you
hurt
yourself,
I
think
that
you'll
be
doing
just
fine
If
you
relax
a
little,
I'm
glad
I
inspire
you
But
Stan,
why
are
you
so
mad?
Try
to
understand
that
I
do
want
you
as
a
fan
I
just
don't
want
you
to
do
some
crazy
shit;
I
seen
this
one
shit
on
the
news
a
couple
weeks
ago
that
made
me
sick
Some
dude
was
drunk
and
drove
his
car
over
a
bridge
And
had
his
girlfriend
in
the
trunk
And
she
was
pregnant
with
his
kid
And
in
the
car
they
found
a
tape
But
they
didn't
say
who
it
was
to
Come
to
think
about
it,
his
name
was
it
was
you,
damn!
Hey,
what's
going
on,
this
is
Paul
Rosenberg,
attorney
of
law.
Listen,
I
listened
to
the
rough
copy
of
your
album
And
uh,
you
know
I've
just
got
to
be
honest
with
you
Can
you
tone
it
down
a
little
bit?
Because
there's
only
so
much
I
can
explain.
Give
me
a
call
I
never
knew
I..
I
never
knew
I..
Mic

I
never
knew
I..
Who

Motherfucker

I

And

the
ceiling
I
never

I..
[Eminem]
I
don't
do
black
music,
I
don't
do
white
music
I
make
fight
music,
for
high
school
kids
I
put
lives
at
risk
when
I
drive
like
this
{*tires
screech*}
I
put
wives
at
risk
with
a
knife
like
this
(AHHH!!)
Shit,
you
probably
think
I'm
in
your
tape
deck
now
I'm
in
the
back
seat
of
your
truck,
with
duct
tape
stretched
out
Ducked
the
fuck
way
down,
waitin
to
straight
jump
out
put
it
over
your
mouth,
and
grab
you
by
the
face,
what
now?
Oh
-
you
want
me
to
watch
my
mouth,
how?
Take
my
fuckin
eyeballs
out,
and
turn
em
around?
Look
-
I'll
burn
your
fuckin
house
down,
circle
around
and
hit
the
hydrant,
so
you
can't
put
your
burning
furniture
out
(Oh
my
God!
Oh
my
God!)
I'm
sorry,
there
must
be
a
mix-up
You
want
me
to
fix
up
lyrics
while
the
President
gets
his
dick
sucked?
{*ewwww*}
Fuck
that,
take
drugs,
rape
sluts
Make
fun
of
gay
clubs,
men
who
wear
make-up
Get
aware,
wake
up,
get
a
sense
of
humor
Quit
tryin
to
censor
music,
this
is
for
your
kid's
amusement
(The
kids!)
But
don't
blame
me
when
lil'
Eric
jumps
off
of
the
terrace
You
shoulda
been
watchin
him
-
apparently
you
ain't
parents
Chorus:
Eminem
Cause
I
never
knew
I,
knew
I
would
get
this
big
I
never
knew
I,
knew
I'd
effect
this
kid
I
never
knew
I'd,
get
him
to
slit
his
wrist
I
never
knew
I'd,
get
him
to
hit
this
bitch
I
never
knew
I,

I
would
get

I
never

I,

I'd

I

So
who's
bringin
the
guns
in
this
country?
(Hmm?)
I
couldn't
sneak
a
plastic
pellet
gun
through
customs
over
in
London
And
last
week,
I
seen
a
Schwarzaneggar
movie
where
he's
shootin
all
sorts
of
these
motherfuckers
with
a
uzi
I
sees
three
little
kids,
up
in
the
front
row,
screamin
"Go,"
with
their
17-year-old
Uncle
I'm
like,
"Guidance
-
ain't
they
got
the
same
moms
and
dads
who
got
mad
when
I
asked
if
they
liked
violence?"
And
told
me
that
my
tape
taught
'em
to
swear
What
about
the
make-up
you
allow
your
12-year-old
daughter
to
wear?
(Hmm?)
So
tell
me
that
your
son
doesn't
know
any
cuss
words
when
his
bus
driver's
screamin
at
him,
fuckin
him
up
worse
("Go
sit
the
fuck
down,
you
little
fuckin
prick!")
And
fuck
was
the
first
word
I
ever
learned
up
in
the
third
grade,
flippin
the
gym
teacher
the
bird
(Look!)
So
read
up,
about
how
I
used
to
get
beat
up
peed
on,
be
on
free
lunch,
and
change
school
every
3
months
My
life's
like
kinda
what
my
wife's
like
(what?)
Fucked
up
after
I
beat
her
fuckin
ass
every
night,
Ike
So
how
much
easier
would
life
be
if
19
million
motherfuckers
grew
to
be
just
like
me?
Chorus
[Eminem]
I
never
knew
I..
knew
I'd..
have
a
new
house
or
a
new
car
A
couple
years
ago
I
was
more
poorer
than
you
are
I
don't
got
that
bad
of

do
I?
Fuck

(HEY!)
How
many
retards'll
listen
to
me
and
run
up
in
the
school
shootin
when
they're
pissed
at
a
teach-er,
her,
him,
is
it
you
is
it
them?
"Wasn't
me,
Slim
Shady
said
to
do
it
again!"
Damn!
How
much
damage
can
you
do
with
a
pen?
Man
I'm
just
as
fucked
up
as
you
woulda
been
if
you
woulda
been,
in
my
shoes,
who
woulda
thought
Slim
Shady
would
be
somethin
that
you
woulda
bought
that
woulda
made
you
get
a
gun
and
shoot
at
a
cop
I
just
said
it
-
I
ain't
know
if
you'd
do
it
or
not
Chorus
[Eminem]
How
the
fuck
was
I
supposed
to
know?
[Old

[Secretary:]
Mr.

[Steve
Berman:]
What?

[Secretary:]
We
have
Eminem
here
to
see
you
[Steve
Berman
(Eminem):]
About
fuckin'
time!
Send
him
in
(Steve!
Good
to
see
ya
man)
Look
who
decided
to
show
his
face!
I
hope
you've
had
fun
in
the
last
4
years.
(Look
man,
I
apologise
again
for-)
For
shooting
me?
!
Do
you
know
I
lost
the
use
of
my
right
arm?
(Again,
it
was
a
mistake,)
(a
terrible
mist-
are
you
wearing
a
bulletproof
vest?)
And
then
you
go
and
you
do
what?
Hide
out?
stay
in
Detroit
from
us
5
years
while
the
music
industry
melts
the
fuck
down?
Do
you
know
how
many
people
lost
their
jobs
because
of
your
fuckin
vacation?
(Well
that's
actually
why
I'm
here,
I
was
gonna,
put
out
some
new
music
and
I
wanted
to
play
it
for
you,
and
get
your
opinion)
Do
I
really
need
to
hear
it?
Let
me
guess,
another
album
about
poor
me,
I'm
so
famous
that
it's
ruined
my
rich
little
life,
and
I'm
such
a
tortured
artist.
Let
me
make
music
about
it
and
my
tragic
love
life,
am
I
on
to
something
here?
(Come
on
man
it's
not
like
that
yo-)
You
know
what?
Just
hand
the
fuckin
thing
over
I'm
done
talkin
to
you.
Think
you
can
just
come
and
go
as
you
please.
Big
selfish
superstar
(Steve,
I
had
a
drug
problem)
Oh
poor
me,
I
had
a
drug
problem.
Who
hasn't
had
a
drug
problem
in
this
town?
You
know
what?
[cocks

(Hey!
hey!)
Just
lay
the
shit
down
on
my
desk
and
get
the
fuck
out
(Woah,
woah,
woah.
Jesus
Christ
man!)
(Alright
alright
here,
fine)
What's
this
shit?
Two
CD's?
(That's
what
I've
been
tryin
to
tell
you
man,
there's
2
albums)
Just
get
out!
(Alright!)
Get
the
fuck
out
(Alright
man,
see
you
later)
[Eminem]
Whatever..
Dre,
just
let
it
run
Aiyyo
turn
the
beat
up
a
little
bit
Aiyyo..
this
song
is
for
anyone..
fuck
it
Just
shut
up
and
listen,
aiyyo..
I
sit
back
with
this
pack
of
Zig
Zags
and
this
bag
of
this
weed
it
gives
me
the
shit
needed
to
be
the
most
meanest
MC
on
this
--
on
this
Earth
And
since
birth
I've
been
cursed
with
this
curse
to
just
curse
And
just
blurt
this
berserk
and
bizarre
shit
that
works
And
it
sells
and
it
helps
in
itself
to
relieve
all
this
tension
dispensin
these
sentences
Gettin
this
stress
that's
been
eatin
me
recently
off
of
this
chest
and
I
rest
again
peacefully
(peacefully)..
but
at
least
have
the
decency
in
you
to
leave
me
alone,
when
you
freaks
see
me
out
in
the
streets
when
I'm
eatin
or
feedin
my
daughter
to
not
come
and
speak
to
me
(speak
to
me)..
I
don't
know
you
and
no,
I
don't
owe
you
a
mo-therfuck-in
thing
I'm
not
Mr.
N'Sync,
I'm
not
what
your
friends
think
I'm
not
Mr.
Friendly,
I
can
be
a
prick
if
you
tempt
me
my
tank
is
on
empty
(is
on
empty)..
No
patience
is
in
me
and
if
you
offend
me
I'm
liftin
you
10
feet
(liftin
you
10
feet)..
in
the
air
I
don't
care
who
is
there
and
who
saw
me
destroy
you
Go
call
you
a
lawyer,
file
you
a
lawsuit
I'll
smile
in
the
courtroom
and
buy
you
a
wardrobe
I'm
tired
of
all
you
(of
all
you)..
I
don't
mean
to
be
mean
but
that's
all
I
can
be
is
just
me
Chorus:

And
I
am,
whatever
you

I

If
I

then
why
would
I

In
the

I

won't
even
play

I

[Eminem]
Sometimes
I
just
feel
like
my
father,
I
hate
to
be
bothered
with
all
of
this
nonsense
it's
constant
And,
"Oh,
it's
his
lyrical
content
-
-
the
song
'Guilty
Conscience'
has
gotten
such
rotten
responses"
And
all
of
this
controversy
circles
me
and
it
seems
like
the
media
immediately
points
a
finger
at
me
(finger
at
me)..
So
I
point
one
back
at
'em,
but
not
the
index
or
pinkie
or
the
ring
or
the
thumb,
it's
the
one
you
put
up
when
you
don't
give
a
fuck,
when
you
won't
just
put
up
with
the
bullshit
they
pull,
cause
they
full
of
shit
too
When
a
dude's
gettin
bullied
and
shoots
up
his
school
and
they
blame
it
on
Marilyn
(on
Marilyn)..
and
the
heroin
Where
were
the
parents
at?
And
look
where
it's
at
Middle
America,
now
it's
a
tragedy
Now
it's
so
sad

it's
burnin

Chorus
[Eminem]
I'm
so
sick
and
tired
of
bein
admired
that
I
wish
that
I
would
just
die
or
get
fired
and
dropped
from
my
label
and
stop
with
the
fables
I'm
not
gonna
be
able
to
top
on
"My
Name
is.."
And
pigeon-holed
into
some
pop-py
sensation
to
cop
me
rotation
at
rock'n'roll
stations
And
I
just
do
not
got
the
patience
(got
the
patience)..
to
deal
with
these
cocky
caucasians
who
think
I'm
some
wigger
who
just
tries
to
be
black
cause
I
talk
with
an
accent,
and
grab
on
my
balls,
so
they
always
keep
askin
the
same
fuckin
questions
(fuckin
questions)..
What
school
did
I
go
to,
what
hood
I
grew
up
in
The
why,
the
who
what
when,
the
where,
and
the
how
'til
I'm
grabbin
my
hair
and
I'm
tearin
it
out
cause
they
drivin
me
crazy
(drivin
me
crazy)..
I
can't
take
it
I'm
racin,
I'm
pacin,
I
stand
and
I
sit
And
I'm
thankful
for
ev-ery
fan
that
I
get
But
I
can't
take
a
SHIT,
in
the
bathroom
without
someone
standin
by
it
No
I
won't
sign
your
autograph
You
can
call
me
an
asshole
I'm
glad
Chorus
(except
change
first
word
"And"
to
"Cause")
May
I
have
your
attention
please?
May
I
have
your
attention
please?
Will
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
I
repeat,
will
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
We're
gonna
have
a
problem
here
Y'all
act
like
ya
never
seen
a
white
person
before
Jaws
all
on
the
floor
like
Pam,
like
Tommy
just
burst
in
the
door
And
started
whooping
her
ass
worse
than
before
They
first
were
divorce,
throwin?her
over
furniture
(Ahh!)
It's
the
return
of
the..."Ah,
wait,
no
way,
you're
kidding,
he
didn't
just
say
what
I
think
he
did,
did
he?"
And
Dr.
Dre
said...
Nothing
you
idiots!
Dr.
Dre's
dead,
he's
locked
in
my
basement!
(Ha-ha!)
Feminist
women
love
Eminem
"Slim
Shady,
I'm
sick
of
him
Look
at
him,
walking
around
grabbing
his
you-know-what
Flipping
the
you-know-who,
yeah,
but
he's
so
cute
though"
Yeah,
I
probably
got
a
couple
of
screws
up
in
my
head
loose
But
no
worse
than
what's
going
on
in
your
parents'
bedrooms
Sometimes,
I
wanna
get
on
TV
and
just
let
loose,
but
can't
But
it's
cool
for
Tom
Green
to
hump
a
dead
moose
"My
bum
is
on
your
lips,
my
bum
is
on
your
lips"
And
if
I'm
lucky,
you
might
just
give
it
a
little
kiss
And
that's
the
message
that
we
deliver
to
little
kids
And
expect
them
not
to
know
what
a
woman's
clitoris
is
Of
course
they
gonna
know
what
intercourse
is
By
the
time
they
hit
fourth
grade
They
got
the
Discovery
Channel
don't
they?
"We
ain't
nothing
but
mammals"
Well,
some
of
us
cannibals
Who
cut
other
people
open
like
cantaloupes
But
if
we
can
hump
dead
animals
and
antelopes
Then
there's
no
reason
that
a
man
and
another
man
can't
elope
But
if
you
feel
like
I
feel,
I
got
the
anecdote
Women
wave
your
panty-hoes,
sing
the
chorus
and
it
goes
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up
Cuz
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm

All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just

So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up
Will
Smith
don't
gotta
cuss
in
his
raps
to
sell
records
Well
I
do
so
"Fuck
him
and
fuck
you
too!"
You
think
I
give
a
damn
about
a
Grammy?
Half
of
you
critics
can't
even
stomach
me
let
alone
stand
me
"But
Slim,
what
if
you
win,
wouldn't
it
be
weird?"
Why?
So
you
guys
could
just
lie
to
get
me
here
So
you
can
sit
me
here
next
to
Britney
Spears
Shit
Christina
Aguilera
better
switch
me
chairs
So
I
can
sit
next
to
Carson
Daly
and
Fred
Durst
And
hear
them
argue
over
who
she
gave
head
to
first
You
little
bitch,
put
me
on
blast
on
MTV
"Yeah,
he's
cute,
but
I
think
he's
married
to
Kim,
hee-hee"
I
should
download
her
audio
on
MP3
and
show
the
whole
world
how
you
gave
Eminem
VD
I'm
sick
of
you
little
girl
and
boy
groups
All
you
do
is
annoy
me
so
I
have
been
sent
here
to
destroy
you
And
there's
a
million
of
us
just
like
me
Who
cuss
like
me;
who
just
don't
give
a
fuck
like
me
Who
dress
like
me;
walk,
talk
and
act
like
me
And
just
might
be
the
next
best
thing
but
not
quite
me!
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real

All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just

Please

I'm
like
a
head
trip
to
listen
to
cuz
I'm
only
giving
you
Things
you
joke
about
with
your
friends
inside
your
living
room
The
only
difference
is
I
got
the
balls
to
say
it
In
front
of
y'all
and
I
don't
gotta
be
frost
or
sugar
coated
at
all
I
just
get
on
a
mic
and
spit
it
and
whether
you
like
to
admit
it
I
just
shitted
better
than
90
percent
of
you
rappers
out
there
Then
you
wonder
how
can
kids
eat
up
these
albums
like
valiums
It's
funny
cuz
at
the
rate
I'm
going
when
I'm
30
I'll
be
the
only
person
in
the
nursing
home
flirting
Pinching
nurses
asses
when
I'm
jacking
off
with
Jergens
And
I'm
jerkin?but
this
whole
bag
of
Viagra
isn't
working
And
every
single
person
is
a
Slim
Shady
lurking
He
could
be
working
at
Burger
King
spitting
on
your
onion
rings
Or
in
the
parking
lot,
circling,
screaming
"I
don't
give
a
fuck!"
With
his
windows
down
and
his
system
up
So,
will
the
real
Shady
please
stand
up?
And
put
one
of
those
fingers
on
each
hand
up?
And
be
proud
to
be
outta
ya
mind
and
outta
control
And
one
more
time,
loud
as
you
can,
how
does
it
go?
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real

All

Hide

Evidence?
Nope!
Never

I

I'm
tryin'
to

critics
I
wouldn't
say
"fuckin'"
for
six
minutes
(*click*
Six
minutes,
Slim
Shady,
you're
on)
My
baby's
mom,
bitch
made
me
an
angry
blonde
So
I
made
me
a
song,
killed
her
and
put
Haley
on
I
may
be
wrong,
I
keep
thinkin'
these
crazy
thoughts
In
my
cranium,
but
I'm
stuck
with
a
crazy
mom
(Is
she
really
on
as
much
dope
as
you
say
she's
on?)
Came
home,
and
somebody
must've
broke
in
the
back
window
And
stole
two
golden
machine
guns
and
both
of
my
trenchcoats
Sick
sick
dreams
of
picnic
scenes,
two
kids,
sixteen
And
M-16's
with
ten
clips
each
And
them
shits
reach
through
6
kids
each
And
Slim
gets
blamed
in
Bill
Clint's
speech
to
fix
these
streets?
FUCK
THAT!
PSH
you
faggots
can
vanish
to
volcanic
ash
And
re-appear
in
hell
with
a
can
of
gas,
AND
a
match
Aftermath,
Dre,
grab
the
gat,
show
'em
where
it's
at
(What

starin'
at,
nigga?)
Don't
you
remember
me?
Remember
me?
Remember
me?!
Remember
me?!

1]
I
murder
a
rhyme
one
word
at
a
time
You
never,
heard
of
a
mind
as
perverted
as
mine
You
better,
get
rid
of
that
nine,
it
aint
gonna
help
What
good's
it
gonna
do
against
a
man
that
strangles
himself?
I'm
waitin
for
hell
like
hell
shit
I'm
anxious
as

Manson,
you're
safe
in
that
cell,
be
thankful
it's

I
used
to
be
my
mommy's
little
angel
at
twelve
At
thirteen
I
was
puttin
shells
in
a
gauge
on
a
shelf
I
used
to,
get
punched
and
bullied
on
my
block
Til
I
cut
a
kitten's
head
off
and
stuck
it
in
this
kid's
mail
box
I
used
to
give
a,
fuck,
now
I
could
give
a
fuckless
What
do
I
think
of
success?
It
sucks
too
much
press
I'm
stressed
Too
much
cess
with
agress
too
upset
it's
just
too
much
mess
I
guess
I
must
just
blew
up
quick,
yes
Grew
up
quick,
no,
was
raised
right,
whatever
you
say
is
wrong
Whatever
I
say
is
right
You
think
of
my
name
now
whenever
you
say
hi
Became
a
commodity
because
I'm
W
H
I
T
E,
cuz
MTV
was
so
friendly
to
me,
can't
wait
till
Kim
sees
me
Now
is
it
worth
it?
Look
at
my
life
how
is
it
perfect?
Read
my
lips
bitch,
what,
my
mouth
isn't
workin?
You
see
this
finger,
oh

upside
down
Here

turn
this
motherfucker
up
right
now

I
take
each
individual
degenerates
head
and
reach
into
it
Just
to
see
if
he's
influenced
by
me
if
he
listens
to
music
And
if
he
feeds
into
this
shit
he's
an
innocent
victim
And
becomes
a
puppet
on
the
string
of
my
tennis
shoe
[vocal
scratches]
My
name
is
Slim
Shady,
I
been
crazy
way
before
radio
didn't
play
me
The
sensational,
"Back

the
incredible!"
With
Ken
Kaniff
who
just
finds
the
men
edible
It's
Ken
Kaniff,
on
the

Trying
to,
lure

It's

Slim
for

Christopher
Reeve's
legs!
Sheez
you
guys
are
so
sensitive
Slim
it's
touchy
subject
try
and
just
don't
mention
it
Mind
with
no
sense
in
it,
tried
to
get
so
frenetic
Whose
eyes
get
so
squinted,
I'm
blind
from
smokin
'em
Wit
my
windows
tinted,
wit
nine
limos
rented,
doin
lines
of
coke
in
'em
Wit
a
bunch
of
guys
hoppin
out
all
high
and
indo
scented
And
that's
where
I
get
my
name
from,
that's
why
they
call
me

Add

A

a

A
natural
old
school
a
bully
shot
em
all
at
one
time
Cuz
I'm
Shady,
they
call
me
as
crazy
As
the
world
was
over
this
whole
Y2K
thing
And
by
the
way,
*N'SYNC
why
do
they
sing
Am
I
the
only
one
who
realizes
they
stink?
Should
I
dye
my
hair
pink
and
care
what
y'all
think?
Lip
sync
and
buy
a
bigger
size
of
earrings?
It's
why
I
tend
to
block
out
when
I
hear
things
Cuz
all
these
fans
screamin
is
makin
my
ears
ring
So
I
just,
throw
up
a
middle
finger
and
let
it
linger
Longer
than
the
rumor
that
I
was
stickin
it
to
Christina
Cuz
if
I
ever
stuck
it
to
any
singer
in
showbiz
It'd
be
Jennifer
Lopez
and
Puffy
you
know
this!
I'm
sorry
Puff,
but
I
don't
give
a
fuck
if
this
chick
was
my
own
mother
I
still
fuck
her
with
no
rubber
and
cum
inside
her
and
have
a
son
and
a
new
brother
at
the
same
time
and
just
say
that
it
aint
mine,
what's
my

Chorus
One:
Eminem
You

Marshall
Mathers
(Marshall

I'm
just
a
regular
guy,
I
don't
know
why
all
the
fuss
about
me
(fuss
about
me)
Nobody
ever
gave
a
fuck
before,
all
they
did
was
doubt
me
(did
was
doubt
me)
Now
everybody
wanna
run
they
mouth
and
try
to
take
shots
at
me
(take
shots
at
me)
[Eminem]
Yo,
you
might
see
me
joggin,
you
might
see
me
walkin
You
might
see
me
walkin
a
dead
rottweiler
dog
with
it's
head
chopped
off
in
the
park
with
a
spiked
collar
hollerin
at
him
cause
the
son
of
a
bitch
won't
quit
barkin
(grrrr,
ARF
ARF)
Or
leanin
out
a
window,
with
a
cocked
shotgun
Drivin
up
the
block
in
the
car
that
they
shot
'Pac
in
Lookin
for
Big's
killers,
dressed
in
ridiculous
blue
and
red
like
I
don't
see
what
the
big
deal
is
Double
barrel
twelve
gauge
bigger
than
Chris
Wallace
Pissed
off,
cause
Biggie
and
'Pac
just
missed
all
this
Watchin
all
these
cheap
imitations
get
rich
off
'em
and
get
dollars
that
shoulda
been
there's
like
they
switched
wallets
And
amidst
all
this
Crist'
poppin
and
wristwatches
I
had
to
sit
back
and
just
watch
and
just
get
nauseous
and
walk
around
with
an
empty
bottle
of
Remi
Martin
startin
shit
like
some
26-year-old
skinny
Cartman
("God
damnit!")
I'm
anti-Backstreet
and
Ricky
Martin
with
instincts
to
kill
N'Sync,
don't
get
me
started
These
fuckin
brats
can't
sing
and
Britney's
garbage
What's
this
bitch
retarded?
Gimme
back
my
sixteen
dollars
All
I
see
is
sissies
in
magazines
smiling
Whatever
happened
to
whylin
out
and
bein
violent?
Whatever
happened
to
catchin
a
good-ol'
fashioned
passionate
ass-whoopin
and
gettin
your
shoes
coat
and
your
hat
tooken?
New
Kids
on
the
Block,
sucked
a
lot
of

Boy/girl
groups

me
sick
And
I
can't
wait
'til
I

(hahaha)
Vanilla
Ice

Said

shit
in
Vibe
to
spite
me
(yup)
Then

hair
just

(hehe)
A
bunch
of
little
kids
wanna
swear
just
like
me
and
run
around
screamin,
"I
don't
care,
just
bite
me"
(nah
nah)
I
think
I
was
put
here
to
annoy
the
world
and
destroy
your
little
4-year-old
boy
or
girl
Plus
I
was
put
here
to
put
fear
in
faggots
who
spray
Faygo
Root
Beer
and
call
themselves
"Clowns"
cause
they
look
queer
Faggot2Dope
and
Silent
Gay
Claimin
Detroit,
when
y'all
live
twenty
miles
away
(fuckin
punks)
And
I
don't
wrestle,
I'll
knock
you
fuckin
faggots
the
fuck
out
Ask
'em
about
the
club
they
was
at
when
they
snuck
out
after
they
ducked
out
the
back
when
they
saw
us
and
bugged
out
(AHHH!)
Ducked
down
and
got
paintballs
shot
at
they
truck,
blaow!
Look
at
y'all
runnin
your
mouth
again
when
you
ain't
seen
a
fuckin
Mile
Road,
South
of
10
And
I
don't
need
help,
from
D-12,
to
beat
up
two
females
in
make-up,
who
may
try
to
scratch
me
with
Lee
Nails
"Slim
Anus,"
you
damn
right,
Slim
Anus
I
don't
get
fucked
in
mine
like
you
two
little
flaming
faggots!
Chorus
Two:
Eminem
Cause
I'm,
just
Marshall
Mathers
(Marshall

I'm
not
a
wrestler
guy,
I'll
knock
you
out
if
you
talk
about
me
(you
talk
about
me)
Come
and
see
me
on
the
streets
alone
if
you
assholes
doubt
me
(assholes
doubt
me)
And
if
you
wanna
run
your
mouth
then
come
take
your
best
shot
at
me
(your
best
shot
at
me)
[Eminem]
Is
it
because
you
love
me
that
y'all
expect
so
much
of
me?
You
little
groupie
bitch,
get
off
me,
go
fuck
Puffy
Now
because
of
this
blonde
mop
that's
on
top
and
this
fucked
up
head
that
I've
got,
I've
gone
pop?
The
underground
just
spunned
around
and
did
a
360
Now
these
kids
diss
me
and
act
like
some
big
sissies
"Oh,
he
just
did
some
shit
with
Missy,
so
now
he
thinks
he's
too
big
to
do
some
shit
with
MC
Get-Bizzy"
My
fuckin
bitch
mom's
suin
for
ten
million
She
must
want
a
dollar
for
every
pill
I've
been
stealin
Shit,
where
the
fuck
you
think
I
picked
up
the
habit?
All
I
had
to
do
was
go
in
her
room
and
lift
up
her
mattress
Which
is
it
bitch,
Mrs.
Briggs
or
Ms.
Mathers?
It
doesn't
matter
you
{*several
seconds
of
silence*}
faggot!
Talkin
about
I
fabricated
my
past
He's
just
aggravated
I
won't
ejaculate
in
his
ass
(Uhh!)
So
tell
me,
what
the
hell
is
a
fella
to
do?
For
every
million
I
make,
another
relative
sues
Family
fightin
and
fussin
over
who
wants
to
invite
me
to
supper
All
the
sudden,
I
got
90
Slim
cousins
(Hey
it's
me!)
A
half-brother
and
sister
who
never
seen
me
or
even
bothered
to
call
me
until
they
saw
me
on
TV
Now
everybody's
so
happy
and
proud
I'm
finally
allowed
to
step
foot
in
my
girlfriend's
house
Hey-hey!
And
then
to
top
it
off,
I
walked
to
the
newsstand
to
buy
this
cheap-ass
little
magazine
with
a
food
stamp
Skipped
to
the
last
page,
flipped
right
fast
and
what
do
I
see?
A
picture
of
my
big
white
ass
Okay,
let
me
give
you
motherfuckers
some
help:
uhh,
here
-
DOUBLE
XL,
DOUBLE
XL
Now
your
magazine
shouldn't
have
so
much
trouble
to
sell
Ahh
fuck

even
buy
a
couple
myself
Chorus
One

Mmmmm...
{*harmonizing*}
(aight)
Guess
what?
I
ain't
coming
in
yet...
I'll
come
in
a
minute
Aiyyo;
this
is
my
love
song,
it
goes
like
this
Back
when
Mark
Walhberg
was
Marky
Mark
This
is
how
we
used
to
make
the
party
start
We
used
to,
mix
Hen'
with
Bacardi
Dark
And
when
it,
kicks
in
you
can
hardly
talk
And
by
the,
sixth
gin
you're
gon'
probably
crawl
And
you'll
be,
sick
then
and
you'll
probably
barf
And
my
pre-diction
is
you're
gon'
probably
fall
either
somewhere
in
the
lobby
or
the
hallway
wall
And
every-thing's
spinnin,
you're
beginnin
to
think
women
are
swimmin
in
pink
linen
again
in
the
sink
Then
in
a
couple
of
minutes
that
bottle
of
Guinness
is
finished
You
are
now
allowed
to
officially
slap
bitches
You
have
the
right
to
remain
violent
and
start
wilin
Start
a
fight
with
the
same
guy
that
was
smart
eyein
you
Get
in
your
car,
start
it,
and
start
drivin
over
the
island
and
cause
a
42
car
pile-up
{*spaceman
voice*}
Earth
calling,
pilot
to
co-pilot
Look
at
the
life
on
this
planet
sir,
no
sign
of
it
All
I
can
see
is
a
bunch
of
smoke
flyin
And
I'm
so
high
that
I
might
die
if
I
go
by
it
Let
me
out
of
this
place,
I'm
outta
place
I'm
in
outer
space,
I've
just
vanished
without
a
trace
I'm
going
to
a
pretty
place
now
where
the
flowers
grow
I'll
be
back
in
an
hour
or
so
Cause
every
time
I
go
to
try
to
leave
(Whoa-ohh!)
Somethin
keeps
pullin
on
my
sleeve
(Whoa-ohh!)
I
don't
wanna,
but
I
gotta
stay
(Whoa-ohh!)
These
drugs
really
got
ahold
of
me
(Whoa-ohh!)
Cause
every
time
I
try
to
tell
them,
"No"
(No-ohh!)
They
won't
let
me
ever
let
them
go
(Go-ohh!)
I'ma
sucka
all
I
gotta
say
(Whoa-ohh!)
is
drugs
really
got
a
hold
of
me
(Whoa-ohh!)
In
third
grade,
all
I
used
to
do
was
sniff
glue
through
a
tube
and
play
Rubix
Cube
Seventeen
years
later
I'm
as
Rude
as
Jude
Schemin
on
the
first
chick
with
the
hugest
boobs
I've
got
no
game,
and
every
face
looks
the
same
They've
got
no
name,
so
I
don't
need
game
to
play
I
just
say
whatever
I
want
to
whoever
I
want
Whenever
I
want,
wherever
I
want,
however
I
want
However,
I
do
show
some
respect
to
few
This
ecstacy's,
got
me
standin
next
to
you
Getting
sentimental
as
fuck
spillin
guts
to
you
We
just
met,
but
I
think
I'm
in
love
with
you
But
you're
on
it
too,
so
you
tell
me
you
love
me
too
Wake
up
in
the
mornin
like
"Yo,
what
the
fuck
we
do?"
I
gotta
go
bitch,
you
know
I
have
stuff
to
do
Cause
if
I
get
caught
cheatin
then
I'm
stuck
with
you
But
in
the
long
run
These
drugs
are
probably
going
to
catch
up
sooner
or
later
But
fuck
it,
I'm
on
one
So
let's
enjoy,
let
the
X
destroy
your
spinal
cord
So
it's
not
a
straight
line
no
more
Til
we
walk
around
looking
like
some
wind-up
dolls
Shit's
stickin
out
of
our
backs
like
a
dinosaur
Shit,
six
hits
won't
even
get
me
high
no
more
So
bye
for
now,
I'm
goin
to
try
to
find
some
more
Cause
every
time
I
go
to
try
to
leave
(Whoa-ohh!)
Somethin
keeps
pullin
on
my
sleeve
(Whoa-ohh!)
I
don't
wanna,
but
I
gotta
stay
(Whoa-ohh!)
These
drugs
really
got
ahold
of
me
(Whoa-ohh!)
Cause
every
time
I
try
to
tell
them,
"No"
(No-ohh!)
They
won't
let
me
ever
let
them
go
(Go-ohh!)
I'ma
sucka
all
I
gotta
say
(Whoa-ohh!)
is
drugs
really
got
a
hold
of
me
(Whoa-ohh!)
That's
the
sound
of
a
bottle
when
it's
hollow
When
you
swallow
it
all
wollow
and
drown
in
your
sorrow
And
tomorrow
you're
probably
gonna
want
to
do
it
again
What's
a
little
spinal
fluid
between
you
and
a
friend?
Screw
it
And
what's
a
little
bit
of
alcohol
poisoning?
And
what's
a
little
fight?
Tomorrow
you'll
be
boys
again
It's
your
life,
live
it
however
you
wanna
Mari-ju-uana
is
everywhere,
where
was
you
brought
up?
It
don't
matter
as
long
as
you
get
where
you're
goin
Cause
none
of
this
shit
is
gonna
mean
shit
where
we're
goin
They
tell
you
to
stop,
but
you
just
sit
there
ignorin
Even
though
you
wake
up
feelin
like
shit
every
mornin
But
you're
young,
you've
got
a
lot
of
drugs
to
do
Girls
to
screw,
parties
to
crash,
sucks
to
be
you
If
I
could
take
it
all
back
now,
I
wouldn't
I
would
have
did
more
shit
that
people
said
that
I
shouldn't
But
I'm
all
grown
up
now
and
upgraded
and
graduated
to
better
drugs
and
updated
But
I
still
got
a
lot
of
growin
up
to
do
I
still
got
a
whole
lot
of
throwin
up
to
spew
But
when
it's
all
said
and
done
I'll
be
40
before
I
know
it
with
a
40
on
the
porch
tellin
stories
with
a
bottle
of
Jack,
two
grandkids
in
my
lap
Babysiting
for
Hailey
while
Hailey's
out
gettin
smashed
Cause
every
time
I

to
try
to

freak
Their

'sleep
Pissy-drunk,

(YOU

That's

funeral
Chorus
2X
[Eminem]
That's
why
the
city
is
filled
with
a
bunch
of
fuckin
idiots
still
(still)
That's
why
the
first
motherfucker
poppin
some
shit
he
gets
killed
(killed)
That's
why
we
don't
call
it
Detroit,
we
call
it
Amityville
('Ville)
You
can
get
capped
after
just
havin
a
cavity
filled
(filled)
Ahahahaha,
that's
why
we're
crowned
the
murder
capital
still
(still)
This
ain't
Detroit,
this
is
motherfuckin
Hamburger
Hill!
(Hill!)
We
don't
do
drivebys,
we
park
in
front
of
houses
and
shoot
and
when
the
police
come
we
fuckin
shoot
it
out
with
them
too!
That's
the
mentality
here
(here)
that's
the
reality
here
(here)
Did
I
just
hear
somebody
say
they
wanna
challenge
me
here??
(huh?)
While
I'm
holdin
a
pistol
with
this
many
calibres
here??
(here??)
Got
some
registration
and
just
made
this
shit
valid
this
year?
(year?)
Cause
once
I
snap
I
can't
be
held
accountable
for
my
acts
and
that's
when
accidents
happen,
when
a
thousand
bullets
come
at
your
house
and
collapse
the
foundation
around
and
they
found
you
and
your
family
in
it
(AHHHHH!)

All

Standin

It's

So

When

I'm

See

You

One

And
during

he
accidentally
gets

Adam's

sliced

And
while

His
son
just
woke
up
and
he
just
walks
in
She
panics
and
he
gets
his
throat
cut
(Oh

God!)
So
now
they
both
dead
and
you
slash
your
own
throat
So
now
it's
double
homicide
and
suicide
with
no

I
should
have
known
better
when
you
started

act
weird
We

You

every

I

these

it's
a

to

I

I

My

did

The

came

disfigured,

It
was
a

who
would
grow

just
as

Don't

make

cause
that
baby
was
me
I'm
a

an

who
turned
crazed
But
how
the

you
sposed
to
grow
up
when
you
weren't
raised?
So
as
I
got
older
and
I
got
a
lot
taller
My
dick
shrunk
smaller,
but
my
balls
got
larger
I
drink
malt

you
up
quicker

you'd
wanna

I'd

His

Children
quiet

please
Brian
don't
throw

Mr.

will
be

[Eminem]
Hi
there
little
boys
and
girls
(FUCK
YOU!)
Today
we're
gonna
to
learn
how
to
poison
squirrels
But
first,
I'd
like
you
to
meet
my
friend
Bob
(Huh?)
Say
hi
Bob!
("Hi
Bob")
Bob's
30
and
still
lives
with
his
mom
and
he
don't
got
a
job,
cause
Bob
sits
at
home
and
smokes
pot
but
his
twelve-year
old
brother
looks
up
to
him
an
awful
lot
And
Bob
likes
to
hang
out
at
the
local
waffle
spot
and
wait
in
the
parkin
lot
for
waitresses
off
the
clock
when
it's
late
and
the
lot
gets
dark
and
fake
like
he
walks
his
dog
Drag
'em
in
the
woods
and
go
straight
to
the
chopping
blocks
(AHH!)
And
even
if
they
escaped
and
they
got
the
cops
the
ladies
would
all
be
so
afraid,
they
would
drop
the
charge
'til
one
night
Mrs.
Stacey
went
off
the
job
when
she
felt
someone
grab
her
whole
face
and
said
not
to
talk
But
Stacey
knew
it
was
Bob
and
said
knock
it
off
But
Bob
wouldn't
knock
it
off
cause
he's
crazy
and
off
his
rocker
Crazier
than
Slim
Shady
is
off
the
vodka
You
couldn't
even
take
him
to
Dre's
to
get
Bob
a
"Dr."
He
grabbed
Stace'
by
the
legs
as
chopped
it
off
her
and
dropped
her
off
in
the
lake
for
the
cops
to
find
her
But
ever
since
the
day
Stacey
went
off
to
wander
they
never
found
her,
and
Bob
still
hangs
at
the
waffle
diner
And
that's
the
story
of
Bob
and
his
marijuana,
and
what
it
might
do
to
you
So
see
if
the
squirrels
want
any
-
it's
bad
for
you
Chorus:
Mr.
Mackey
(Eminem)
See
children,
drugs
are
bahhhd
(c'mon)
and
if
you
don't
believe
me,
ask
ya
dahhhd
(ask
him
man)
and
if
you
don't
believe
him,
ask
ya
mom
(that's
right)
She'll
tell
you
how
she
does
'em
all
the
time
(she
will)
So
kids
say
no
to
drugs
(that's
right)
So
you
don't
act
like
everyone
else
does
(uh-huh)
Then
there's
really
nothin
else
to
say
(sing
along)
Drugs
are
just
bad,
mmm'kay?
[Eminem]
My
penis
is
the
size
of
a
peanut,
have
you
seen
it?
FUCK
NO
you
ain't
seen
it,
it's
the
size
of
a
peanut
(Huh?)
Speakin
of
peanuts,
you
know
what
else
is
bad
for
squirrels?
Ecstasy
is
the
worst
drug
in
the
world
If
someone
ever
offers
it
to
you,
don't
do
it
Kids
two
hits'll
probably
drain
all
your
spinal
fluid
and
spinal
fluid
is
final,
you
won't
get
it
back
So
don't
get
attached,
it'll
attack
every
bone
in
your
back
Meet
Zach,
twenty-one
years
old
After
hangin
out
with
some
friends
at
a
frat
party,
he
gets
bold
and
decides
to
try
five,
when
he's
bribed
by
five
guys
and
peer
pressure
will
win
every
time
you
try
to
fight
it
Suddenly,
he
starts
to
convulse
and
his
pulse
goes
into
hyperdrive
and
his
eyes
roll
back
in
his
skull
{*blblblblblb*}
His
back
starts
tah
-
look
like
the
McDonald's
Arches
He's
on
Donald's
carpet,
layin
horizontal
barfin
{*BLEH*}
And
everyone
in
the
apartment
starts
laughin
at
him
"Hey
Adam,
Zach
is
a
jackass,
look
at
him!"
cause
they
took
it
too,
so
they
think
it's
funny
So
they're
laughing
at
basically
nothing
except
maybe
wasting
his
money
Meanwhile,
Zach's
in
a
coma,
the
action
is
over
and
his
back
and
his
shoulders
hunched
up
like
he's
practicin
yoga
And
that's
the
story
of
Zach,
the
ecstasy
maniac
So
don't
even
feed
that
to
squirrels
class,
cause
it's
bad
for
you
Chorus:
Mr.
Mackey
(Eminem)
See
children,
drugs
are
bahhhd
(that's
right)
and
if
you
don't
believe
me,
ask

and
if

ask
ya
mom
(you
can)
She'll
tell
you
how
she
does
'em
all
the
time
(she
will)
So
kids
say
no
to
drugs
(smoke
crack)
So
you
don't
act
like
everyone
else
does
(that's
right)
And
there's
really
nothin
else
to
say
(but
umm)
Drugs
are
just
bad,
mmm'kay?
[Eminem]
And
last
but
not
least,
one
of
the
most
humungous
problems
among
young
people
today,
is
fungus
It
grows
from
cow
manure,
they
pick
it
out,
wipe
it
off,
bag
it
up,
and
you
put
it
right
in
your
mouth
and
chew
it
Yum
yum!
Then
you
start
to
see
some
dumb
stuff
And
everything
slows
down
when
you
eat
some
of
'em..
And
sometimes
you
see
things
that
aren't
there
(Like
what?)
Like
fat
woman
in
G-strings
with
orange
hair
(Mr.
Shady
what's
a
G-string?)
It's
yarn
Claire
Women
stick
'em
up
their
behinds,
go
out
and
wear
'em
(Huh?)
And
if
you
swallow
too
much
of
the
magic
mushrooms
Whoops,
did
I
say
magic
mushrooms?
I
meant
fungus
Ya
tongue
gets,
all
swoll
up
like
a
cow's
tongue
(How
come?)
cause
it
comes
from
a
cow's
dung
(Gross!!)
See
drugs
are
bad,
it's
a
common
fact
But
your
mom
and
dad,
know
that's
all
that
I'm
good
at
(Oh!)
But
don't
be
me,
cause
if
you
grow
up
and
you
go
and
O.D.
They're
gonna
come
for
me
and
I'ma
have
to
grow
a
goatee
and
get
a
disguise
and
hide,
cause
it'll
be
my
fault
So
don't
do
drugs,
and
do
exactly
as
I
don't,
cause
I'm
bad
for
you
Chorus:
Mr.
Mackey
(Eminem)
See
children,
drugs
are
bahhhd
(uh-huh)
and
if
you
don't
believe
me,
ask
ya

that
down)
and
if
you
don't
believe
him,
ask
ya
mom
(you
can
ask)
She'll
tell
you
how
she
does
'em
all
the
time
(and
she
will)
So
kids
say
no
to
drugs
(say
no)
So
you
don't
act
like
everyone

(like
I
do)
And
there's

their
necks
for
the
freedem

the
United

Government
has
sworn

uphold
Yo,
I
want
everyone

to
the

Verse
#1
I
never
woulda
dreamed
in
a
million
years
id
see
so
many
mutha
fuckin
people
who
feel
like
me
Who
share
the
same
views
And
the
same
exact
beliefs
Its
like
a
fuckin
army
marchin
in
back
of
me
So
many
lives
i
touched
So
much
anger
aimed
at
no
perticular
direction
Just
sprays
and
sprays
Straight
through
your
radio
wavs
It
plays
and
plays
Till
it
stays
stuck
in
your
head
For
days
and
days
who
woulda
thought
standin
in
this
mirror
Bleachin
my
hair
wit
some
Peroxide
Reachin
for
a
T
shirt
to
wear
That
i
would
catipult
to
the
fore-front
of
rap
like
this
How
can
i
predict
my
words
And
have
an
impact
like
this
I
musta
struck
a
chord
wit
somebody
up
in
the
office
Cuz
congress
keeps
tellin
me
I
aint
causin
nuttin
but
problems
And
now
they
sayin
im
in
trouble
wit
the
government
Im
lovin
it
I
shovelled
shit
all
my
life
And
now
im
dumpin
it
on

Verse
#2
Look

If

Shady

shelf
But
Shadys

Shady

Shady's
dimples
would
help
Make
ladies
swoon
baby
(ooo

Look
at
myself!
Lets
do
the
math
If
i
was
black
i
woulda
sold
half
I
aint
have
to
graduate
From
Lincoln
High
School
to
know
that
But
i
can
rap
so
fuck
school
Im
too
cool
to
go
back
Gimme
the
mic
Show
me
where
the
fuckin
studio's
at
When
i
was
underground
No
one
gave
a
fuck
i
was
white
No
lables
wanted
to
sign
me
Almost
gave
up,
i
was
like
"Fuck
it"
Until
i
met
Dre
The
only
one
who
looked
past
Gave
me
a
chance
And
i
lit
a
fire
up
under
his
ass
Helped
him
get
back
to
the
top
Every
fan
black
that
i
got
Was
probly
his
In
exchange
for
every
white
fan
that
he's
got
Like
damn
we
just
swapped
Sittin
back
look
at
this
shit
wow
Im
like
"Does
this
skin
work
for
my
benifit
now?"
Chorus
Verse
#3
See
the
problem
is
i
speak
to
suberban
kids
Who
otherwise
Woulda
never
knew
these
words
exist
These
moms
probly
woulda
never
gave
2
squirts
of
piss
Till
i
created
so
much
mutha
fuckin
turbulence
Straight
out
the
tube
right
into
ya
livin
rooms
i
came
And
kids
Flipped
When
they
found
out
i
was
produced
by
Dre
Thats
all
it
took
And
they
were
instantly
hooked
right
in
And
they
connected
wit
me
too
cuz
i
looked
like
them
Thats
why
they
put
my
lyrics
up
under
this
microscope
Searchin
wit
a
fine
toothed
comb
Its
like
this
rope
waitin
to
choke
Tightenin
around
my
throat
Watchin
me
while
i
write
this
like
"I
dont
like
this,
NO!"
All
i
hear
is
Lyrics
lyrics
constant
controversy
Sponsors
workin
round
the
clock
To
try
to
stop
my
concerts
early
Surely
hip
hop
is
never
a
problem
In
Harlem
only
In
Boston
After
it
bothered
ya
fathers
of
daughters
startin
to
blossom
Now
im
catchin
the
flack
from
these
activists
When
they
raggin
Actin
like
im
the
1st
rapper
to
smack
a
bitch
and
say
faggot
Shit
Just
look
at
me

A

Chorus
Outro
So
to
the
parents
of
America
I
am
the
damager
aimed
at
little
Erica
To
attack
her
character
The
ring
leader
of
the
circus
of
worthless
pawns
Sent
to
lead
the
march
right
up
to
the
steps
of
Congress
And
piss
on
the
lawns
of
the
whitehouse
To
burn
the
casket
and
replace
it
with
a
parental
advisory
sticker
To
spit
liquor
in
the
faces
of
this
democracy
of
hipocracy
Fuck
you
Ms
Cheeney
Fuck
you
Tipper
Gore
Fuck
you

the

Holy

To
the
Rapmobile

let's
go!
(Marshall!
Marshall!)
Bitches

gentlemen!
It's
showtime!
Hurry

step

up!
Introducing
the
star
of
our
show
His
name
is
(Marshall!)
You
wouldn't
want
to
be
Anywhere
else
in
the
world
right
now
So
without
further
ado,
I
bring
to
you
(Marshall!)
You
'bout
to
witness
hip-hop
in
its
most
purest
Most
rawest
form,
flow
almost
flawless
Most
hardest,
most
honest
known
artist
Chip
off
the
old
block,
but
old
Doc
is
(back)
Looks
like
Batman
brought
his
own
Robin
Oh
God,
Saddam's
got
his
own
Laden
With
his
own
private
plane,
his
own
pilot
Set
to
blow
college
dorm
rooms
doors
off
the
hinges
Oranges,
peach,
pears,
plums,
syringes
Vrinn,
vrinn!
Yeah,
here
I
come,
I'm
inches
Away
from
you,
dear,
fear
none
Hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
9-1-1,
so
Let's
get
down
to
business
I
don't
got
no
time
to
play
around,
what
is
this?
Must
be
a
circus
in
town,
let's
shut
the
shit
down
On
these
clowns;
can
I
get
a
witness?
(Hell
yeah!)

Quick,

Gee
willikers
Dre,
"Holy
bat
syllables!"
Look
at
all
the
bullshit
that
goes
on
In
Gotham
when
I'm
gone
Time
to
get
rid
of
these
rap
criminals
So
skip
to
your
lou
while
I
do
what
I
do
best
You
ain't
even
impressed
no
more,
you're
used
to
it
Flows
too
wet,
nobody
close
to
it
Nobody
says
it
but
still
everybody
knows
the
shit
The
most
hated
on
out
of
all
those
who
say
they
get
hated
on
in
eighty
songs
and
exaggerate
it
all
so
much
They
make
it
all
up,
there's
no
such
thing
Like
a
female
with
good
looks
who
cooks
and
cleans
It
just
means
so
much
more
to
so
much
more
People
when
you're
rappin'
and
you
know
what
for
The
show
must
go
on;
so
I'd
like
to
welcome
y'all
To
Marshall
and
Andre's
carnival,
c'mon!
Now
let's
get
down
to
business
I
don't
got

Must
be

It's
just
like
old
times,
the
Dynamic
Duo
Two
old
friends,
why
panic?
You
already
know
Who's
fully
capable,
the
two
caped
heroes
Dial
straight
down
the
center,
eight-zero-zero
You
can
even
call
collect,
the
most
feared
duet
Since
me
and
Elton
played
career
Russian
Roulette
And
never
even
see
me
blink
or
get
to
bustin'
a
sweat
People
steppin'
over
people
just
to
rush
to
the
set
Just
to
get
to
see
an
MC
who
breathes
so
freely
Ease
over
these
beats
and
be
so
breezy
Jesus,
how
can
shit
be
so
easy?
How
can
one
Chandra
be
so
Levy?
Turn
on
these
beats,
MC's
don't
see
me
Believe
me,
BET
and
MTV
Are
gonna
grieve
when
we
leave,
dog,
fo'
sheezy
Can't
leave
rap
alone,
the
game
needs
me
'Til
we
grow
beards,
get
weird
and
disappear
Into
the
mountains,
nothin'
but
clowns
down
here
But
we
ain't
fuckin'
around
round
here
Yo,
Dre
(What
up?)
Can
I
get
a
"hell
yeah"?
(Hell
yeah!)
Now
let's
get
down
to
business
I
don't
got

So
there

have
it,
folks
(Marshall!)
has
come
to
save
the
day
Back
with
his
friend
Andre
Here
to
remind
you
that
bullshit
does
not
pay
Because
(Marshall!)
and
Andre
are
here
to
stay
And
never
go
away,
until
our
dying
day
Until
we're
old
and
grey
(Marshall!)
So
until
next
time,
friends
Same
blonde
hair,
same
rap
channel
Good
night,
everyone!
Thank
you
for
coming!
Your
host
for
the
evening
(Marshall!)
Oh!
Heh
Where's
my
snare,
I
have
no
snare
in
my
headphones,
there
ya'
go,
yeah,
yo',
yo'...
Have
you
ever
been
hated
or
discriminated
against,
I
have,
i've
been
protested
and
demonstrated
against,
picket
signs
for
my
wicked
rhymes,
look
at
the
times,
sick
is
the
mind
of
the
motherfuckin'
kid
that's
behind,
all
this
commotion,
emotions
run
deep
as
ocean's
explodin',
tempers
flaring
from
parents,
just
blow
'em
off
and
keep
goin',
not
takin'
nothin'
from
no
one,
give
'em
hell
long
as
i'm
breathin',
keep
kickin'
ass
in
the
mornin',
an'
takin'
names
in
the
evening,
leave
'em
with
a
taste
as
sour
as
vinegar
in
they
mouth,
see
they
can
trigger
me
but
they'll
never
figure
me
out,
look
at
me
now,
I
bet
ya'
probably
sick
of
me
now,
ain't
you
mama,
i'ma
make
you
look
so
ridiculous
now...
[CHORUS]
I'm
sorry
mama,
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you,
I
never
meant
to
make
you
cry,
but
tonight
i'm
cleanin'
out
my
closet,
{one
more
time},
I
said
i'm
sorry
mama,
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you,
I
never
meant
to
make
you
cry,
but
tonight
i'm
cleanin'
out
my
closet...
I
got
some
skeletons
in
my
closet
and
I
don't
know
if
no
one
knows
it,
so
before
they
thrown
me
inside
my
coffin
and
close
it,
i'ma
expose
it,
i'll
take
you
back
to
'73,
before
I
ever
had
a
multi-platinum
sellin'
Cd,
I
was
a
baby,
maybe
I
was
just
a
couple
of
months,
my
faggot
father
must
have
had
his
pantie's
up
in
a
bunch,
cause
he
split,
I
wonder
if
he
even
kissed
me
goodbye,
no
I
don't
on
second
thought,
I
just
fuckin'
wished
he
would
die,
I
look
at
Hailie
and
I
couldn't
picture
leavin'
her
side,
even
if
I
hated
Kim,
I
grit
my
teeth
and
I'd
try,
to
make
it
work
with
her
at
least
for
Hailie's
sake,
I
maybe
made
some
mistakes
but
i'm
only
human,
but
i'm
man
enough
to
face
them
today,
what
I
did
was
stupid,
no
doubt
it
was
dumb,
but
the
smartest
shit
I
did
was
take
them
bullets
out
of
that
gun,
cause
id'a
killed
'em,
shit
I
would
have
shot
Kim
and
him
both,
it's
my
life,
i'd
like
to
welcome
y'all
to
the
Eminem
show...
[CHORUS]
Now
I
would
never
diss
my
own
mama
just
to
get
recognition,
take
a
second
to
listen
who
you
think
this
record
is
dissin',
but
put
yourself
in
my
position,
just
try
to
envision
witnessin'
your
Mama
poppin'
prescription
pills
in
the
kitchen,
bitchin'
that
someone's
always
goin'
through
her
purse
and
shits
missin',
going
through
public
housing
systems,
victim
of
Munchausen's
syndrome,
my
whole
life
I
was
made
to
believe
I
was
sick
when
I
wasn't
'til
I
grew
up,
now
I
blew
up,
it
makes
you
sick
to
ya'
stomach,
doesn't
it,
wasn't
it
the
reason
you
made
that
Cd
for
me,
ma,
so
you
could
try
to
justify
the
way
you
treated
me,
ma,
but
guess
what,
your
gettin'
older
now
and
it's
cold
when
your
lonely,
and
Nathan's
growing
up
so
quick,
he's
gonna
know
that
your
phoney,
and
Hailie's
getting
so
big
now,
you
should
see
her,
she's
beautiful,
but
you'll
never
see
her,
she
won't
even
be
at
your
funeral,
see
what
hurts
me
the
most
is
you
won't
admit
you
was
wrong,
bitch,
do
your
song,
keep
tellin'
yourself
that
you
was
a
mom,
but
how
dare
you
try
to
take
what
you
didn't
help
me
to
get,
you
selfish
bitch,
I
hope
you
fuckin'
burn
in
hell
for
this
shit,
remember
when
Ronnie
died
and
you
said
you
wished
it
was
me,
well
guess
what,
I
am
dead,
dead
to
you
as
can
be...

Nothing
moves
me
more
than
a

that
suits

Nothing
suits

Nothing

There's
nothing

I'm
a
soldier,
i'm
a
soldier,
i'm
a
soldier,
i'm
a
soldier...
Yo',
never
was
a
thug,
just
infatuated
with
guns,
never
was
a
gangsta,
'til
I
graduated
to
one,
and
got
the
rep
of
a
villain,
for
weapon
concealin',
took
the
image
of
a
thug,
kept
shit
appealin',
willin'
to
stick
out
my
neck,
for
respect
if
it
meant
life
or
death,
never
live
to
regret
what
I
said,
when
you're
me,
people
just
want
to
see,
if
it's
true,
if
it's
you,
what
you
say
in
your
rap's,
what
you
do,
so
they
feel,
as
part
of
your
obligation
to
fulfill,
when
they
see
you
on
the
streets,
face
to
face,
are
you
for
real,
in
confrontation
ain't
no
conversation,
if
you
feel
you're
in
violation,
any
hesitation'll
get
you
killed,
if
you
feel
it,
kill
it,
if
you
conceal
it,
reveal
it,
being
reasonable
will
leave
you
full
of
bullets,
pull
it,
squeeze
it,
till
it's
empty,
tempt
me,
push
me,
pussies,
I
need
a
good
reason
to
give
this
trigger
a
good
squeeze...
[Chorus:]
I'm
a
soldier,
these
shoulder's
hold
up
so
much,
they
won't
budge,
i'll
never
fall
or
fold
up,
i'm
a
soldier,
even
if
my
collar
bone's
crush
or
crumble,
I
will
never
slip
or
stumble,
i'm
a
soldier,
these
shoulder's
hold
up
so
much,
they
won't
budge,
i'll
never
fall
or
fold
up,
i'm
a
soldier,
even
if
my
collar
bone's
crush
or
crumble,
I
will
never
stumble...
I
love
pissin'
you
off,
it
get's
me
off,
like
my
lawyer's,
when
the
fuckin'
judge
let's
me
off,
all
you
motherfuckers
gotta
do
is
set
me
off,
i'll
violate
and
all
the
motherfuckin'
bet's
be
off,
i'm
a
lit
fuse,
anything
I
do
bitche,
it's
news,
pistol
whippin'
motherfuckin'
bouncers,
six-two,
who
needs
bullets,
soon
as
I
pull
it,
you
sweat
bullets,
an
excellent
method
to
get
rid
of
the
next
bully,
it's
actually
better
cause
instead
you
murderin',
you
can
hurt
em'
and
come
back
again
and
kick
dirt
at
'em,
it's
like
pourin'
salt
in
the
wounds,
assault
and
get
sued,
you
can
smell
the
lawsuits
soon
as
I
waltz
in
the
room,
everybody
halts
and
stops,
calls
the
cops,
all
you
see
is
bitches
comin'
out
their
halter
tops,
runnin'
and
duckin'
out
the
Hard
Rocks
parking
lot,
you'll
all
get
shot
whether
its
your
fault
or
not,
cause...
[Chorus]
I
spit
it
slow
so
these
kids
know
that
i'm
talkin'
to
'em,
give
it
back
to
these
damn
critics
and
sock
it
to
em,
i'm
like
a
thug,
with
a
little
bit
of
Pac
influence,
I
spew
it,
and
look
how
I
got
you
bitches
rockin'
to
it,
you
motherfuckers
could
never
do
it
like
I
could
do
it,
don't
even
try
it,
you'll
look
stupid,
do
not
pursue
it,
don't
ever
in
your
life,
try
to
knock
the
truest,
I
spit
the
illest
shit,
ever
been
dropped
to
two
inch,
so
ticky-tock
listen
as
the
sound
ticks
on
the
clock,
listen
to
the
sound
of
Kim
as
she
licks
on
a
cock,
listen
to
the
sound
of
me
spillin'
my
heart
through
this
pen,
motherfuckers
know
that
i'll
never
be
Marshall
again,
full
of
controversy
until
I
retire
my
jersey,
'til
the
fire
inside
dies
and
expires
at
thirty,
and
Lord
have
mercy
on
any
more
of
these
rappers
that
verse
me,
and
put
a
curse
on
authorities
in
the
face
of
adversity,
i'm
a...

Yo'

[Verse
1]
I
thought
I
had
it
all
figured
out,
I
did
I
thought
I
was
tough
enough
to
stick
it
out
with
Kim
But
I
wasn't
tough
enough
to
juggle
two
things
at
once
I
found
myself
layin'
on
my
knees
in
cuffs
Which
should've
been
a
reason
enough,
for
me
to
get
my
stuff
and
just
leave
How
come
I
couldn't
see
this
shit
myself,
it's
just
me
Nobody
couldn't
see
the
shit
I
felt
Knowin'
damn
well
she
wasn't
gonna
be
there
when
I
fell,
to
catch
me
The
minute
shit
was
heated
she
just
bailed
i'm
standin'
here
swingin'
on
like
thirty
people
by
myself
I
couldn't
even
see
the
millimetere
when
it
fell
Turned
around
saw
Gary
stashin'
the
heater
in
his
belt
Saw
the
bouncers
rush
him
and
beat
him
to
the
ground
I
just
sold
two
million
records,
I
don't
need
to
go
to
jail
I'm
not
about
to
lose
my
freedom
over
no
female
I
need
to
slow
down
Try
to
get
my
feet
on
solid
ground,
so
for
now
i'm...
[CHORUS]
[Verse
2]
Bury
my
face
in
comic
books,
cause
I
don't
want
to
look
At
nothin',
this
world's
too
much
I've
swallowed
all
I
could
If
I
could
swallow
a
bottle
of
tylenol
I
would,
and
end
it
for
good
Just
say
goodbye
to
Hollywood
I
probably
should,
these
problems
are
piling
all
at
once
Cause
everything
that
bothers
me,
I
got
it
bottled
up
I
think
i'm
bottomin'
out
But
i'm
not
about
to
give
up,
I
gotta
get
up
Thank
God,
I
got
a
little
girl
And
I'm
a
responsible
father
So
not
a
lot
of
good,
i'd
be
to
my
daughter
layin'
in
the
bottom
of
the
mud
Must
be
in
my
blood
cause
I
don't
know
how
I
do
it
All
I
know
is
I
don't
want
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
my
dad
Cause
I
hate
him
so
bad
The
worst
fear
that
I
had
was
growin'
up
to
be
like
his
fuckin'
ass,
man
If
you
could
understand
why
I
am
the
way
that
I
am
What
do
I
say
to
my
fans,
when
I
tell
'em
i'm...
[CHORUS]
[Verse
3]
I
don't
wanna
quit,
but
shit,
I
feel
like
this
is
it
For
me
to
have
this
much
appeal
like
this
is
sick
This
is
not
a
game,
this
fame,
in
real
life
this
is
sick
Publicity
stunt
my
ass,
conceal
my
fuckin'
dick
Fuck
the
guns,
i'm
done,
i'll
never
look
at
gats
If
I
scrap,
i'll
scrap
like
I
ain't
never
whooped
some
ass
I
love
my
fans
But
no
one
ever
puts
a
grasp
on
the
fact
i've
sacrificed
everything
I
have
I
never
dreamt
i'd
get
to
the
level
that
i'm
at,
this
is
whack
This
is
more
than
I
ever
could
of
asked
everywhere
I
go,
a
hat,
a
sweater
hood,
or
mask
What
about
math,
how
come
I
wasn't
ever
good
at
that
It's
like
the
boy
in
the
bubble,
who
never
could
adapt,
i'm
trapped
If
I
could
go
back,
I
never
woulda
rapped
I
sold
my
soul
to
the
devil,
i'll
never
get
it
back
I
just
wanna
leave
this
game
with
level
head
intact
Imagine
goin'
from
bein'
a
no
one
to
seein',
everything
blow
up
and
all
you
did
was
just
grow
up
emceeing
It's
fuckin'
crazy
Cause
all
I
wanted
was
to
give
Hailie
the
life
I
never
had
But
instead
I
forced
us
to
live
alienated,
so
i'm
sayin'...
[CHORUS]
[Outro]
Goodbye,
goodbye
Hollywood,
{Goodbye},
please
don't
cry
for
me,
when
i'm

That's
why
I
ain't
got
no
time,
for
these
games
and
stupid
tricks,
all
these
bitches
on
my
dick,
that's
how
dudes
be
getting
sick,
that's
how
dicks
be
getting
drips,
falling
victims
to
this
shit,
from
these
bitches
on
our
dicks,
fucking
chickens
with
no
ribs,
that's
why
I
ain't
got
no
time...
[Obie

Yo',
I
woke
up
fucked
up
off
the
liquor
I
drunk,
I
had
a
bag
of
the
skunk
won
in
last
nights
tunk,
pussy
residue
was
on
my
penis,
Denise
from
the
cleaners,
fucked
me
good,
you
should
of
seen
this,
big
booty
bitch,
switch
unbearable,
french
roll
stylin',
body
like
a
stallion,
sizin'
up
the
figure
while
my
shit
getting
bigger,
debatin'
on
a
fuck
or
do
I
want
to
be
her
nigga,
caressin'
this
bitch,
plus
i'm
checking
out
them
tit's,
sippin'
on
that
fine
shit
I
ain't
used
to
buyin',
I
gotta
hit
it
from
behind,
it's
mandatory,
like
takin'
hoe's
money,
but
that's
another
story,
for
surely,
the
pussy
on
toast
after
we
toast,
her
clothes
fell
like
bishop
in
juice,
the
womb
beater,
clean
pussy
eater,
insertin'
my
jock
in
that
spot
hotter
than
the
hottest
block,
don't
stop,
the
response
I
got
when
I
was
knockin'
it,
clock
steady
tickin',
kinky
finger
lickin',
and
can
on,
semen's
at
my
tip
when
she
moans,
I
gotta
slow
down
before
I
cum
soon,
and
work
that
nigga,
like
a
slave
owner,
when
I
dropped
off
my
outfit,
she
knew
I
wanted
to
bone
her,
she
foamin'
at
the
lips,
the
one
between
them
hips,
pubic
hairs
lookin'
like
some
sour
cream
dip,
without
the
nacho,
my
dick
hit
the
spot
though,
pussy
tighter
than
conditions
of
us
black
folks,
we
in
the
final
stretch,
the
last
part
of
sex,
I
bust
a
fat
ass
nut,
then
I
woke
up
next,
like
what
the
fuck
is
goin'
on
here,
this
bitch
evaporated,
pussy
and
all,
just
picked
up
and
vacated,
now
i'm
frusturated
cause
my
dick
was
unprotected,
and
Doctor
Wesley
tellin'
me
I
really
got
that
shit...
[CHORUS]
[Eminem]
Now
I
don't
wanna
hit
no
woman,
but
this
chick's
got
it
comin',
someone
better
get
this
bitch,
before
she
get's
kicked
in
the
stomach,
and
she's
pregnant,
but
she's
eggin'
me
on,
beggin'
me
to
throw
her
off
the
steps
of
this
porch,
my
only
weapon
is
force
and
I
don't
wanna
resort
to
any
violence
of
any
sort,
but
what's
she
shovin'
me
for,
doesn't
she
love
me
no
more,
wasn't
she
huggin'
me
four
minutes
ago
at
the
door,
man,
i'm
this
close
to
goin'
toe-to-toe
with
this
whore,
what
would
you
do
if
she
was
tellin'
you
she
wants
a
divorce,
she's
havin'
another
baby
in
a
month,
and
it's
yours,
and
you
find
out
it
isn't
cause
this
bitch
has
been
visitin'
someone
else,
and
suckin'
his
dick
and
kissin'
you
on
the
lips
when
you
get
back,
to
Michigan,
now
the
plot
is
thickenin'
worse,
cause
you
feel
like
you've
been
stickin'
your
fuckin'
dick
in
a
hearse,
so
you
paranoid
at
every
little
cold
that
you
get,
ever
since
they
told
you

I've
created
a
monster,
‘cause
nobody
wants
to
See
Marshall
no

they
want
Shady,
I'm
chopped
liver
Well,
if
you
want
Shady,
this
is
what
I'll
give
ya
A
little
bit
of
weed
mixed
with
some
hard
liquor
Some
vodka
that'll
jump
start
my
heart
quicker
Than
a
shock
when
I
get
shocked
at
the
hospital
By
the
doctor
when
I'm
not
co-operating
When
I'm
rocking
the
table
while
he's
operating
(heyyy!)
You
waited
this
long,
now
stop
debating
‘Cause
I'm
back,
I'm
on
the
rag
and
ovulating
I
know
that
you
got
a
job,
Ms.
Cheney
But
your
husband's
heart
problem's
complicating
So
the
FCC
won't
let
me
be
Or
let
me
be
me,
so
let
me
see
They
try
to
shut
me
down
on
MTV
But
it
feels
so
empty
without
me
So,
come
on
and
dip,
bum
on
your
lips
Fuck
that!
Cum
on
your
lips
and
some
on
your
tits
And
get
ready,
‘cause
this
shit's
about
to
get
heavy
I
just
settled
all
my
lawsuits—fuck
you,
Debbie!
Now
this
looks
like
a
job
for
me
So
everybody,
just
follow
me!
‘Cause
we
need
a
little
controversy
‘Cause
it
feels
so
empty
without
me
I
said
this
looks

for

So
everybody,
just
follow
me!
‘Cause
we
need
a

‘Cause
it
feels
so
empty
without
me
Little
hellions,
kids
feeling
rebellious
Embarrassed
their
parents
still
listen
to
Elvis
They
start
feeling
like
prisoners
helpless
'Til
someone
comes
along
on
a
mission
and
yells,
"Bitch!!!"
A
visionary,
vision
is
scary
Could
start
a
revolution,
polluting
the
airwaves
A
rebel,
so
just
let
me
revel
and
bask
In
the
fact
that
I
got
everyone
kissing
my
ass
{​​smack}​​
And
it's
a
disaster,
such
a
catastrophe
For
you
to
see
so
damn
much
of
my
ass—you
asked
for
me?
Well,
I'm
back,
na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix
your
bent
antenna,
tune
it
in,
and
then
I'm
gonna
Enter
in,
and
up
under
your
skin
like
a
splinter
The
center
of
attention,
back
for
the
winter
I'm
interesting,
the
best
thing
since
wrestling
Infesting
in
your
kid's
ears
and
nesting
Testing,
attention
please
Feel
the
tension
soon
as
someone
mentions
me
Here's
my
ten
cents,
my
two
cents
is
free
A
nuisance,
who
sent?
You
sent
for
me?
Now
this
looks
like
a
job
for
me
So
everybody,
just
follow
me!
‘Cause
we
need
a
little
controversy
‘Cause
it
feels
so
empty
without
me
I

So

follow
me!
‘Cause

‘Cause

A
tisk-it
a
task-it,
I'll
go
tit
for
tat
with
Anybody
who's
talking
"this
shit,
that
shit"
Chris
Kirkpatrick,
you
can
get
your
ass
kicked
Worse
than
them
little
Limp
Bizkit
bastards
And
Moby?
You
can
get
stomped
by
Obie
You
36-year-old
baldheaded
fag,
blow
me!
You
don't
know
me,
you're
too
old,
let
go
It's
over,
nobody
listens
to
techno
Now
let's
go,
just
give
me
the
signal
I'll
be
there
with
a
whole
list
full
of
new
insults
I
been
dope,
suspenseful
with
a
pencil
Ever
since
Prince
turned
himself
into
a
symbol
But
sometimes
the
shit
just
seems
Everybody
only
wants
to
discuss
me
So
this
must
mean
I'm
disgusting
But
it's
just
me,
I'm
just
obscene
No,
I'm
not
the
first
king
of
controversy
I
am
the
worst
thing
since
Elvis
Presley
To
do
black
music
so
selfishly
And
use
it
to
get
myself
wealthy
(Heyyy!)
There's
a
concept
that
works
Twenty
million
other
white
rappers
emerge
But
no
matter
how
many
fish
in
the
sea
It'll
be
so
empty
without
me
Now
this
looks
like
a
job
for
me
So
everybody,
just
follow
me!
‘Cause
we
need
a
little
controversy
‘Cause
it
feels
so
empty
without
me
I
said
this
looks
like
a
job
for
me
So
everybody,
just
follow
me!
‘Cause
we
need
a
little
controversy
‘Cause

Kids!
These
ideas
are,
nightmares
to
white
parents
Whose
worst
fear
is
a
child
with
dyed
hair
and
who
likes
earrings
Like
whatever
they
say
has
no
bearing
It's
so
scary
in
a
house
that
allows,
no
swearing
To
see
him
walking
around
with
his
headphones
blaring
Alone
in
his
own
zone,
cold
and
he
don't
care
He's
a
problem
child,
and
what
bothers
him
all
comes
out
When
he
talks
about,
his
fucking
dad
walking
out
Cause
he
hates
him
so
bad
that
he,
blocks
him
out
If
he
ever
saw
him
again
he'd
probably
knock
him
out
His
thoughts
are
wacked,
he's
mad
so
he's
talking
back
Talking
black,
brainwashed
from
rock
and
rap
He
sags
his
pants,
doo-rags
and
a
stocking
cap
His
step-father
hit
him
so
he
socked
him
back
And
broke
his
nose,
his
house
is
a
broken
home
There's
no
control,
he
just
lets
his
emotions
go
Sing
with
me,
sing
for
the
year
(sing
it)
Sing
for
the
laughter,
sing
for
the
tear
(Come
on!)
Sing
it
with
me,
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow,
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
Entertainment
is
changing,
intertwining
with
gangsters
In
the
land
of
the
killers
a
sinner's
mind
is
a
sanctum
Holy
or
unholy,
only
have
one
homie
Only
this
gun,
lonely
cause
don't
anyone
know
me
Yet
everybody
just
feels
like
they
can
relate
I
guess
words
are
a
mothafucka,
they
can
be
great
Or
they
can
degrade,
or
even
worse,
they
can
teach
hate
It's
like
these
kids
hang
on
every
single
statement
we
make
Like
they
worship
us,
plus
all
the
stores
ship
us
platinum
Now
how
the
fuck
did
this
metamorphosis
happen?
From
standing
on
corners
and
porches
just
rapping
To
having
a
fortune,
no
more
kissing
ass
But
then
these
critics
crucify
you,
journalists
try
to
burn
you
Fans
turn
on
you,
attorneys
all
want
a
turn
at
you
To
get
they
hands
on
every
dime
you
have
They
want
you
to
lose
your
mind
every
time
you
mad
So
they
can
try
to
make
you
out
to
look
like
a
loose
cannon
Any
dispute
won't
hesitate
to
produce
handguns
That's
why
these
prosecutors
wanna
convict
me
Strictly
just
to
get
me
off
of
these
streets
quickly
But
all
their
kids
been
listening
to
me
religiously
So
I'm
signing
CD's
while
police
fingerprint
me
They're
for
the
judge's
daughter
but
his
grudge
is
against
me
If
I'm
such
a
fucking
menace
this
shit
doesn't
make
sense
B
It's
all
political,
if
my
music
is
literal
Then
I'm
a
criminal,
how
the
fuck
can
I
raise
a
little
girl?
I
couldn't,
I
wouldn't
be
fit
to
You're
full
of
shit
too
Guerrera;
that
was
a
fist
that
hit
you
Sing
with
me,
sing
for
the
year
(sing
it)
Sing
for
the
laughter,
sing
for
the
tear
(sing
this
shit!)
Sing
it
with
me,
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow,
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
They
say
music
can
alter
moods
and
talk
to
you
Well,
can
it
load
a
gun
up
for
you
and
cock
it
too?
Well
if
it
can,
and
the
next
time
you
assault
a
dude
Just
tell
the
judge
it
was
my
fault,
and
I'll
get
sued
See
what
these
kids
do
is
hear
'bout
us
toting
pistols
And
they
wanna
get
one
cause,
they
think
the
shit's
cool
Not
knowing
we
really
just
protecting
ourselves
We
entertainers,
of
course
the
shit's
affecting
our
sales
You
ignoramus,
but
music
is
reflection
of
self
We
just
explain
it,
and
then
we
get
our
checks
in
the
mail
It's
fucked
up
ain't
it?
How
we
can
come
from
practically
nothing
To
being
able
to
have
any
fucking
thing
that
we
wanted
That's
why
we,
sing
for
these
kids
who
don't
have
a
thing
Except
for
a
dream
and
a
fucking
rap
magazine
Who
post
pin-up
pictures
on
they
walls
all
day
long
Idolize
their
favorite
rappers
and
know
all
their
songs
Or
for
anyone
who's
ever
been
through
shit
in
they
lives
So
they
sit
and
they
cry
at
night
wishing
they'd
die
'til
they
throw
on
a
rap
record
and
they
sit
and
they
vibe
We're
nothing
to
you,
but
we're
the
fucking
shit
in
their
eyes
That's
why
we,
seize
the
moment
try
to
freeze
it
and
own
it
Squeeze
it
and
hold
it,
cause
we
consider
these
minutes
golden
And
maybe
they'll
admit
it
when
we're
gone
Just
let
our
spirits
live
on
Through
our
lyrics
that
you
hear
in
our
songs
and
we
can
Sing
with
me,
sing
for
the
year
(sing
it)
Sing
for
the
laughter,
sing
for
the
tear
(Come
on!)
Sing
it
with
me,
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow,
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
Sing
with
me,
sing
for
the

Sing
for
the
laughter,

for
the
tear
(Come
on!)
Sing

me,
just

tomorrow,
the

will
take
you
away
(Mhmmm)
*inhales*
You
high,
baby?
(Yeah)
Yeah?
(Talk
to
me!)
You
want
me
to
tell
you
something?
(Uh
huh)
I
know
what
you
wanna
hear
I
know
you
want
me,
baby,
I
think
I
want
you
too
(I
think
I
love
you,
baby)
I
think
I
love
you
too
I'm
here
to
save
you,
girl,
come
be
in
Shady's
world
I
wanna
grow
together,
let's
let
our
love
unfurl
You

I
want
you
too
They
call
me
Superman,
I'm
here
to
rescue
you
I
wanna
save
you,
girl,
come
be
in
Shady's
world
(Ooh
boy,
you
drive
me
crazy)
Bitch,
you
make
me
hurl
They
call
me
Superman
Leap
tall
hoes
in
a
single
bound
I'm
single
now:
got
no
ring
on
this
finger
now
I'd
never
let
another
chick
bring
me
down
In
a
relationship;
save
it,
bitch!
Babysit?
You
make
me
sick
Superman
ain't
savin'
shit
Girl,
you
can
jump
on
Shady's
dick
Straight
from
the
hip,
cut
to
the
chase
I
tell
a
motherfuckin'
slut
to
her
face
Play
no
games,
say
no
names
Ever
since
I
broke
up
with
what's-her-face
I'm
a
different
man,
kiss
my
ass
Kiss
my
lips?
Bitch,
why
ask?
Kiss
my
dick,
get
my
cash?
I'd
rather
have
you
whip
my
ass
Don't
put
out,
I'll
put
you
out
Won't
get
out,
I'll
push
you
out
Puss
blew
out,
poppin'
shit
Wouldn't
piss
on
fire
to
put
you
out
Am
I
too
nice?
Buy
you
ice?
Bitch,
if
you
died,
wouldn't
buy
you
life
What,
you
tryin'
to
be
my
new
wife?
What,
you
Mariah?
Fly
through
twice
But
I
do
know
one
thing
though
Bitches,
they
come,
they
go
Saturday
through
Sunday,
Monday
Monday
through
Sunday,
yo
Maybe
I'll
love
you
one
day
Maybe
we'll
someday
grow
'Til
then
just
sit
your
drunk
ass
on
that
fuckin'
runway,
ho
Cause
I
can't
be
your
Superman
Can't
be
your
Superman
Can't

Can't

I
can't

Don't

It's
no
secret,
everybody

Yeah,

That's
about
as
far
as
your
buddy
goes
We'll
be
friends,
I'll
call
you
again
I'll
chase
you
around
every
bar
you
attend
Never
know
what
kinda
car
I

in
We'll
see
how
much
you
be
partyin'
then
You
don't
want
that,
neither
do
I
I
don't
wanna
flip
when
I
see
you
with
guys
Too
much
pride,
between
you
and
I
Not
a
jealous
man,
but
females
lie
But
I
guess
that's
just
what
sluts
do
How
could
it
ever
be
just
us
two?
I'd
never
love
you
enough
to
trust
you
We

I

There

Leave

Good

You

You

Ooh

Don't

End

backhands
Put
anthrax

a
Tampax
And
slap
you
'til
you
can't
stand
Girl,
you
just
blew
your
chance
Don't
mean
to
ruin
your
plans
But
I
do
know
one
thing
though
Bitches,

come,
they
go
Saturday
through
Sunday,
Monday
Monday
through
Sunday,
yo
Maybe
I'll
love
you
one
day
Maybe
we'll
someday
grow
'Til
then
just
sit
your
drunk
ass
on
that
fuckin'
runway,
ho
Cause
I
can't
be

Can't

Your

Can't

Your

I

Shady's

let
our
love

You

you
know
I
want
you
too
They
call

Superman,
I'm
here
to
rescue
you
I
wanna
save
you,
girl,
come
be
in
Shady's
world
(Ooh

crazy)
Bitch,

Cause
I
can't
be
your

Can't

Can't

Can't

I

Yo,
I
can't
sing,
but
I
feel
like
singing
I
wanna
fuckin'
sing
Cause
I'm
happy
Yeah,
I'm
happy
I
got
my
baby
back
Yo,
check
it
out
Some
days
I
sit
starin'
out
the
window
Watchin'
this
world
pass
me
by
Sometimes
I
think
there's
nothin'
to
live
for
I
almost
break
down
and
cry
Sometimes
I
think
I'm
crazy
I'm
crazy?
Oh,
so
crazy
Why
am
I
here?
Am
I
just
wastin'
my
time?
But
then
I
see
my
baby
Suddenly
I'm
not
crazy
It
all
makes
sense
when
I
look
into
her
eyes,
oh
no
Cause
sometimes
it
feels
Like
the
world's
on
my
shoulders
Everyone's
leanin'
on
me
Cause
sometimes
it
feels
Like
the
world's
almost
over
But
then
she
comes
back
to
me
My
baby
girl
keeps
gettin'
older
I
watch
her
grow
up
with
pride
People
make
jokes
cause
they
don't
understand
me
They
just
don't
see
my
real
side
I
act
like
shit
don't
faze
me
Inside
it
drives
me
crazy
My
insecurities
could
eat
me
alive
But
then
I
see
my
baby
Suddenly
I'm
not
crazy
It
all
makes
sense
when
I
look
into
her
eyes,
oh
no
Cause
sometimes
it
feels
Like
the
world's
on
my
shoulders
Everyone's
leanin'
on
me
Cause
sometimes
it
feels
Like
the
world's
almost
over
But
then
she
comes
back
to
me
Man,
if
I
could
sing,
I'd
keep
singin'
this
song
to
my
daughter
If
I
could
hit
the
notes,
I'd
blow
somethin'
as
long
as
my
father
To
show
her
how
I
feel
about
her,
how
proud
I
am
that
I
got
her
God,
I'm
a
daddy,
I'm
so
glad
that
her
mom
didn't
*want
her*
Now,
you
probably
get
this
picture
from
my
public
persona
That
I'm
a
pistol-packin'
drug
addict
who
bags
on
his
mama
But
I
wanna
just
take
this
time
out
to
be
perfectly
honest
Cause
there's
a
lot
of
shit
I
keep
bottled
That
hurts
deep
inside
of
my
soul
And
just
know
that
I
grow
colder
the
older
I
grow
This
boulder
on
my
shoulder
gets
heavy
and
harder
to
hold
And
this
load
is
like
the
weight
of
the
world
And
I
think
my
neck
is
breakin'
Should
I
just
give
up
or
try
to
live
up
to
these
expectations?
Now
look,
I
love
my
daughter
more
than
life
in
itself
But
I
got
a
wife
that's
determined
to
make
my
life
livin'
hell
But
I
handle
it
well,
given
the
circumstances
I'm
dealt
So
many
chances,
man,
it's
too
bad,
coulda
had
someone
else
But
the
years
that
I've
wasted
Is
nothin'
to
the
tears
that
I've
tasted
So
here's
what
I'm
facin':
three
felonies,
six
years
of
probation
I've
went
to
jail
for
this
woman
I've
been
to
bat
for
this
woman
I've
taken
bats
to
people's
backs
Bent
over
backwards
for
this
woman
Man,
I
shoulda
seen
it
comin',
what'd
I
stick
my
penis
up
in?
Wouldn't
have
ripped
the
prenup
up
If
I'd
have
seen
what
she
was
fuckin',
but
fuck
it
It's
over,
there's
no
more
reason
to
cry
no
more
I
got
my
baby,
baby,
the
only
lady
that
I
adore,
Hailie
So
sayonara,
try
tomorrow,
nice
to
know
ya
Our
baby's
traveled
back
to
the
arms
of
her
rightful
owner
And
suddenly
it
seems
like
my
shoulder
blades
have
just
shifted
It's
like
the
greatest
gift
you
can
get,
the
weight
has
been
lifted
And
now
it
don't
feel
like
the
world's
on
my
shoulders
Everyone's
leanin'
on
me
Cause
my
baby
knows
that
her
daddy's
a
soldier
Nothin'
can
take
her
from
me
Wooo!
Told
you
I
can't
sing
Oh
well,
I
tried
Hailie,
remember
when
I
said
If
you
ever
need
anything,
Daddy
would
be
right
there?
Guess
what,
Daddy's
here
And
I
ain't
goin'
nowhere,
baby
I
love
you
(??*smooch*)??

[Steve
Berman:]
What?

[Secretary:]
We

Eminem
here
to
see
you
[Steve
Berman
(Eminem):]
About
fuckin'
time!
Send
him
in
(Steve!
Good
to
see
ya
man)
Look
who
decided
to
show
his
face!
I
hope
you've
had
fun
in
the
last
4
years.
(Look
man,
I
apologise
again
for-)
For
shooting
me?
!
Do
you
know
I
lost
the
use
of
my
right
arm?
(Again,
it
was
a
mistake,)
(a
terrible
mist-
are
you
wearing
a
bulletproof
vest?)
And
then
you
go
and
you
do
what?
Hide
out?
stay
in
Detroit
from
us
5
years
while
the
music
industry
melts
the
fuck
down?
Do
you
know
how
many
people
lost
their
jobs
because
of
your
fuckin
vacation?
(Well
that's
actually
why
I'm
here,
I
was
gonna,
put
out
some
new
music
and
I
wanted
to
play
it
for
you,
and
get
your
opinion)
Do
I
really
need
to
hear
it?
Let
me
guess,
another
album
about
poor
me,
I'm
so
famous
that
it's
ruined
my
rich
little
life,
and
I'm
such
a
tortured
artist.
Let
me
make
music
about
it
and
my
tragic
love
life,
am
I
on
to
something
here?
(Come
on
man
it's
not
like
that
yo-)
You
know
what?
Just
hand
the
fuckin
thing
over
I'm
done
talkin
to
you.
Think
you
can
just
come
and
go
as
you
please.
Big
selfish
superstar
(Steve,
I
had
a
drug
problem)
Oh
poor
me,
I
had
a
drug
problem.
Who
hasn't
had
a
drug
problem
in
this
town?
You
know
what?
[cocks
gun]
(Hey!
hey!)
Just
lay
the
shit
down
on
my
desk
and
get
the
fuck
out
(Woah,
woah,
woah.
Jesus
Christ
man!)
(Alright
alright
here,
fine)
What's
this
shit?
Two
CD's?
(That's
what
I've
been
tryin
to
tell
you
man,
there's
2
albums)
Just
get
out!
(Alright!)
Get
the
fuck
out
(Alright
man,
see
you
later)
Music,
reality,
sometimes
it's
hard
to
tell
the
difference
But
we
as
entertainers
have
a
responsibility
to
these
kids
Sike!
If
I
were
to
die
murdered
in
cold
blood
tomorrow
Would
you
feel
sorrow
or
show
love
Or
would
it
matter
Can
never
be
the
lead-off
batter
of
things
Shit
for
me
to
feed
off
I'm
see-saw
battlin
But
theres
way
too
much
at
stake
for
me
to
be
fake
There's
too
much
on
my
plate
And
I
came
way
too
far
in
this
game
to
turn
and
walk
away
And
not
say
what
I
got
to
say
What
the
fuck
you
take
me
for?
a
joke?
you
smokin
crack?
Before
I
do
that,
I
beg
Mariah
to
take
me
back
I
get
up
'for
i
get
down,
run
myself
in
the
ground,
'for
I
put
some
wack
shit
out
I'm
tryin-a
smack
this
one
out
the
park,
five-thousand
mark
Ya'll
steady
tryin
to
drown
the
shark
Ain't

nothin
but
piss

off
Lid
to
the
can
of
whoop
ass,

me
off
See

Fuck

Talk

if
you're
really
feeling
froggish,
leap
Yo

you
gonna
let
him
get
away
with
that?
He
tried
to
play
you,
you
can't
let
him
skate
with
that
Man
I
hate
this
crap,
this
ain't
rap,
This
is
crazy
the
way
we
act
When
we
confuse
hip-hop
with
real
life
when
the
music
stops
There
ain't
no
getting
rid
of
McVeigh
If
so
you
woulda
tried
The
only
way
I'm
leavin
this
bitch
is
suicide
I
have
died
clinically,
arrived
back
at
my
enemy's
crib
with
hennesy,
Got
drunk
then
I
finished
he
I'm
every
nigga's
favorite
arch-enemy.
Physically
fitted
to
be
the
most
dangerous
nigga
with
beef
I
spark
willingly
with
a
dillinger
in
the
dark
dilligently
I'm
not
what
you
think
I
appear
to
be
fucked
up
Mentally
endangered
I
can't
stay
away
from
a
razor
I
just
want
my
face
in
a
paper
I
wish
a
nigga
had
a
grenade
to
squeeze
tight
to
awake
neighbors
for
acres
I
murder
you
Danger
had
me
turned
into
a
mad
man,
son
of
sam,
bitch,
I'm
surgical
I'l
allergic
to
dyin,
you
think
not?
you
got
balls?
We
can
see
how
large
When
the
music
stops
I
was
happy
having
a
deal
at
first,
Thought
money
would
make
me
happy
but
It
only
made
my
pain
worst,
It
hurts
when
u
see
ur
friends
turn
their
back
on
u
dawg
When
u
ain't
got
nothing
left
but
ur
word
and
ur
balls
And
you're
stressed
from
the
calls
of
your
new
friends
Beggin'
with
they
hands
out
Checking
for
ur
record
when
its
selling
When
it
aint,
that's
the
end,
no
laughs
No
friends
no
girl
Just
the
gin
u
drink
till
u
car
spin
u
then
[Screech]
Damn!
[Crash]
U
slam
into
the
wall
and
u
fall
Out
the
car,
trying
to
crawl
with
one
arm
About
to
lose
it
all
in
a
pool
of
alcohol
If
my
funeral's
tomorrow,
wonder
if
they
would
even
call
when
the
music
stops
Let's
see
how
many
of
your
men
loyal,
When
i
pull
up
looking
for
you,
With
a
pistol
sipping
on
a
can
of
pennzoil
I'm
revved
up,
who
said
what
would
lead
bust
ur
head
would
just
explode
With
red
stuff
i'm
hand
cuffed
tossed
in
the
paddy
wagon
Braggin
about
how
u
shot
it
like
a
coward,
bullets
devour
you
showered
you
Niggars,
if
i
was
u
niggas,
i'll
run
while
given
the
chance
Understand
i
can
enchance
the
spirit
of
man
Death
itself,
it
can't
hurt
me,
just
the
thought
of
dying
alone
that
really
Irks
me,
u
ain't
worthy
to
speak
thoughts
of
cheap
talk
Be
smart
and
stop
trying
to
walk
how
g's
walk
before
we
spark
Hug
the
floor
while
we
plan
to
the
war
with
ur
life,
fuck
the
tour
and
the
mic
I'll
rather
fuck
a
whore
with
a
knife,
deliver
that
shit
the
coroner's
like
You
high
hype
poppin'
shit
in
broad
day
light
nigga
ur
a
gonna
at
night
When
The
Music
Stops
Instigators,
turn
pits
in
cages
Let
loose
and
bit
the
neighbours
wrist
to
razors
Ya'll
don't
want
war,
you
want
talk
In
the
dark
my
dogs
all
bark
like
woof
Proof
nigga
I'm
a
wolf,
get
your
whole
roof
Caved
in
like
reindeer
hoofs
Stomped
the
roof
shake
the
floor
tiles
loose
The

more
I

This

Put

Or

When

I'ma
step
on
you
and
not
even
know
it
Ya
midget,
Mini-Me,
with
a
buncha
little
Mini-You's
Runnin
around
your
backyard
swimming
pools
Over
80
million
records
sold
And
I
ain't
had
to
do
it
with
10
or
11
year
olds
[Chorus:]
Cuz
what
you
say
is
what
you
say
Say
what
you
say
how
you
say
it
whenever
you
sayin
it
Just
remember
how
you
said
it
when
you
was
sprayin
it
So
who
you
playin
with
huh
huh
huh
huh?
Cuz
what
you
say
is
what
you
say
Say
what
you
say
how
you
say
it
whenever
you
sayin
it
Just
remember
how
you
said
it
when
you
was
sprayin
it
So
who

with
huh
huh

huh?
[Eminem]
Second
verse,
it
gets
worst
It
gets
no
better
than
this
Amatuers
drink
veteran
piss
From
a
Dixie
cup,
if
you
ever
mix
me
up
Or
confuse
me
with
a
Canibus
or
Dre
with
a
Dupri
Will
rub
it
in,
every
club
your
in,
we'll
have
you
Blackballed
and
make
sure
you
never
rap
a
fucken
again
Dre
ain't
havin
it
as
long
as
Im
here,
play
Devil's
Advocate
[Dr.
Dre]
If
there
was
some
magic
shit
I
could
wave
Over
the
indusrty
that
could
save
it
when
I'm
gone
And
bury
to
make
sure
the
tradition
carries
on
I
would
[Eminem]
If
I
could
only
use
this
power
for
good
I
wouldn't,
not
even
if
I
could
[Dr.
Dre]
From
the
hood
and
I'm
a
hornet
And
I'ma
only
sting
when
I'm
cornered
[Eminem]
And
I'ma
only
sucker
punch
or
swing
without
warnin
And
swing
to
knock
somebody's
fuckin
head
off
Cuz
I
know,
when
they
get
up,
I
won't
get
a
chance
to
let
off
Another
punch,
I'm
punk-rock,
no
one's
punk
Don't
give
a
fuck,
white
Pac,
so
much
spunk
When
I
was
little
I
knew
I
would
blow
up
And
sell
a
mil
or
grow
up
to
be
a
tiller
Go
nuts
and
be
a
killer
[Dr.
Dre]
And
I'm
somethin
of
a
phenom
One
puff
of
the
chron
I'm
unstoppable,
I'm
alive,
I'm
on
top
again
There's
no
obstacle
that
I
can't
conquer
So
come
along
with
us
(Come
On)
[Chorus:]
Cuz
what
you
say
is
what
you
say
Say
what
you
say
how
you
say
it
whenever
you
sayin
it
Just
remember
how
you
said
it
when
you
was
sprayin
it
So
who
you
playin
with
huh
huh
huh
huh?
Cuz
what
you
say
is
what
you
say
Say
what
you
say
how
you
say
it
whenever
you
sayin
it
Just
remember
how
you
said
it
when
you
was
sprayin
it
So
who
you
playin
with
huh
huh
huh
huh?
[Dr.
Dre]
Now
anybody
who
knows
Dre
Knows
I'm
about
fast
cars
and
alize,
partyin
all
day
But
I
handle
my
business
cuz
it's
work
before
play
Don't
look
for
trouble
but
I
serve
you
gourmet
However
you
want
it,
you
could
have
it
your
way
You
fuck
my
night
up,
I'ma
fuck
up
your
day
Bullet
with
your
name,
sendin
it
your
way
That
goes
for
anyone
who
walks
thru
that
doorway
Cuz
this
is
my
space,
you
invade
it
Live
to
regret
it
and
you
die
tryin
to
violate
it
Fuck
around
and
you'll
get
anahilated
Eyes
diliated
[Eminem]
Ha,
like
my
old
lady
Cuz
what
you
say
is
what
you
say
Sometimes
what
you
mean
is
2
different
things
Depending
on
your
mood,
if
it
swings,
think
too
many
things
Little
hit
of
Dre's
weed,
I
can
do
anything
Catch
a
contact,
then
I'm
gone
and
I'm
back
I
speed
write
and
my
loose
leaves
my
lanch
pad
[Dr.
Dre]
And
I
can
pull
any
string
Don't
have
to
prove
anything
Catch
a
contract
on
your
head
You
headed
West,
talk
shit
about
Dre?
You
better
get
a
vest,
then
invest
in
something
To
protect
your
head
and
neck
[Eminem]
And
it's
back
and
forth
all
day
like
Red
and
Meth
I
joke
when
I
say
I'm
the
best
in
the
booth
But
a
lot
of
truth
is
said
injest
And
if
I
ever
do
live
to
be
a
legend
I'ma
die
a
sudden
death,
5
mics
in
The
Source
Ain't
holdin'
my
fuckin
breath
But
I
suffocate
for
the
respect
Fore
I
breath
the
collect
the
fuckin
check
[Chorus:]
Cuz
what
you
say
is
what
you
say
Say
what
you
say
how
you
say
it
whenever
you
sayin
it
Just
remember
how
you
said
it
when
you
was
sprayin
it
So
who
you
playin
with
huh
huh
huh
huh?
Cuz
what
you
say
is
what
you
say
Say
what
you
say
how
you
say
it
whenever
you
sayin
it
Just
remember
how
you
said
it
when
you
was
sprayin
it
So
who
you
playin
with
huh
huh
huh
huh?
[Dr.
Dre]
Watch
your
fuckin'
mouth
[Timbaland]
Yo
this
Timbaland,
tell
him
I
said
suck
[tchka]
my
dick
Cause
sometimes
you
just
feel
tired,
feel
weak
And
when
you
feel
weak,
you
feel
like
you
wanna
just
give
up
But
you
gotta
search
within
you,
and
gotta
find
that
inner
strength,
and
just
pull
that
shit
out
of
you
And
get
that
motivation
to
not
give
up
And
not
be
a
quitter,
no
matter
how
bad
you
wanna
just
fall
flat
on
your
face,
and
collapse
Till
I
collapse
I'm
spilling
these
raps
long
as
you
feel
'em
Till
the
day
that
I
drop
you'll
never
say
that
I'm
not
killing
'em
Cause
when
I
am
not,
then
I'mma
stop
penning
'em
And
I
am
not
hip
hop
and
I'm
just
not
Eminem
Subliminal
thoughts,
when
I'ma
stop
sending
'em?
Women
are
caught
in
webs,
spin
'em
and
hock
venom
Adrenaline
shots
of
penicillin
could
not
get
the
illin'
to
stop
Amoxicillin's
just
not
real
enough
The
criminal
cop
killin',
hip-hop
villain
A
minimal
swap
to
cop
millions
of
Pac
listeners
You're
coming
with
me,
feel
it
or
not,
you're
gonna
fear
it
Like
I
showed
you
the
spirit
of
God
lives
in
us
You
hear
it
a
lot,
lyrics
to
shock
Is
it
a
miracle
or
am
I
just
product
of
pop
fizzin'
up?
Fa
shizzel
my
wizzel,
this
is
the
plot,
listen
up
You
bizzels
forgot,
Slizzel
does
not
give
a
fuck
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Music
is
like
magic,
there's
a
certain
feeling
you
get
When
you
real
and
you
spit,
and
people
are
feeling
your
shit
This
is
your
moment,
and
every
single
minute
you
spend
Tryna
hold
on
to
it
because
you
may
never
get
it
again
So
while
you're
in
it,
try
to
get
as
much
shit
as
you
can
And
when
your
run
is
over
just
admit
when
it's
at
its
end
Because
I'm
at
the
end
of
my
wits
with
half
the
shit
that
gets
in
I
got
a
list,
here's
the
order
of
my
list
that
it's
in
It
goes
Reggie,
Jay-Z,
2Pac
and
Biggie
Andre
from
OutKast,
Jada,
Kurupt,
Nas
and
then
me
But
in
this
industry
I'm
the
cause
of
a
lot
of
envy
So
when
I'm
not
put
on
this
list
the
shit
does
not
offend
me
That's
why
you
see
me
walk
around
like
nothing's
bothering
me
Even
though
half
you
people
got
a
fuckin'
problem
with
me
You
hate
it
but
you
know
respect
you
got
to
give
me
The
press's
wet
dream,
like
Bobby
and
Whitney,
Nate,
hit
me
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Soon
as
a
verse
starts
I
eat
at
an
emcee's
heart
What
is
he
thinking?
How
not
to
go
against
me,
smart
And
it's
absurd
how
people
hang
on
every
word
I'll
probably
never
get
the
props
I
feel
I
ever
deserve
But
I'll
never
be
served,
my
spot
is
forever
reserved
If
I
ever
leave
Earth,
that
would
be
the
death
of
me
first
Cause
in
my
heart
of
hearts
I
know
nothing
could
ever
be
worse
That's
why
I'm
clever
when
I
put
together
every
verse
My
thoughts
are
sporadic,
I
act
like
I'm
an
addict
I
rap
like
I'm
addicted
to
smack
like
I'm
Kim
Mathers
But
I
don't
want
to
go
forth
and
back
in
constant
battles
The
fact
is
I
would
rather
sit
back
and
bomb
some
rappers
So
this
is
like
a
full-blown
attack
I'm
launching
at
'em
The
track
is
on
some
battling
raps,
who
want
some
static?
Cause
I
don't
really
think
that
the
fact
that
I'm
Slim
matters
A
plaque
and
platinum
status
is
whack
if
I'm
not
the
baddest
So...
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Until
the
roof
(until
the
roof)
The
roof
comes
off
(the
roof
comes
off)
Until
my
legs
(until
my
legs)
Give
out
from
(underneath
me)
I
will
not
fall,
I
will
stand
tall
Feels
like
no
one
can
beat
me
"Hello,
boys
and
girls!
Today
we're
gonna
talk
about
father
and
daughter
relationships.
Do
you
have
a
daddy?
I'll
bet
you
do..!
Who's
your
daddy?"
"Daddy,
what
are
you
doing?"
Okay
then!
Everybody,
listen
up!
I'm
going
to
Hell!
Who's
coming
with
me?
Somebody,
please
help
him!
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
There's
no
mountain
I
can't
climb
There's
no
tower
too
high
No
plane
that
I
can't
learn
how
to
fly
What
do
I
gotta
do
to
get
through
to
you
To
show
you
there
ain't
nothin'
I
can't
take
this
chainsaw
to?
(Rahhnnn!)
Fuckin'
brains,
brawn
and
brass
balls
I
cut
'em
off
and
got
'em
pickled
and
bronzed
in
a
glass
jar
Inside
of
a
hall,
with
my
framed
autographed
sunglasses
With
Elton
John's
name
on
my
drag
wall
I'm
out
the
closet,
I've
been
lyin'
my
ass
off
All
this
time,
me
and
Dre
been
fuckin'
with
hats
off
(Suck
it,
Marshall!)
So
tell
Laura
and
her
husband
to
back
off
'Fore
I
push
this
motherfuckin'
button
and
blast
off
And
launch
one
at
these
Russians,
and
that's
all
Blow
every
fuckin'
thing
except
Afghanistan
on
the
map
off
When
will
it
stop?
When
will
I
knock
the
crap
off?
{*knocking*}
Hailie,
tell
'em,
baby!
(My
dad's
lost
it!)
There's
really
nothin'
else
to
say,
I
can't
explain
it
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
A
little
help
from
Hailie
Jade,
won't
you
tell
'em,
baby?
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
There's
nothin'
you
could
do
or
say
that
could
ever
change
me
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
There's
no
one
on
Earth
that
can
save
me,
not
even
Hailie
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
It's
like
my
mother
always
told
me
Rana
rana
rana
rana
rana
rana
rana
rana
rana
and
codeine
And
goddamn
it,
you
little
motherfucker
If
you
ain't
got
nothin'
nice
to
say,
then
don't
say
nothin'!
Uh
Fuck
that
shit,
bitch!
Eat
a
motherfuckin'
dick,
chew
on
a
prick
And
lick
a
million
motherfuckin'
cocks
per
second
I'd
rather
put
out
a
motherfuckin'
gospel
record
I'd
rather
be
a
pussy-whipped
bitch
Eat
pussy
and
have
pussy
lips
glued
to
my
face,
with
a
clit
Ring
in
my
nose
than
quit
bringin'
my
flows
Quit
givin'
me
my
ammo;
can't
you
see
why
I'm
so
mean?
If
y'all
leave
me
alone
this
wouldn't
be
my
M.O.
I
wouldn't
have
to
go
eenee-meene-minie-moe
Catch
a
homo
by
his
toe,
man,
I
don't
know
no
more
Am
I
the
only
fuckin'
one
who's
normal
any
more?
(Dad!)
There's
really
nothin'
else
to
say
I
can't
explain
it
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
A
little
help
from
Hailie
Jade
Won't
you
tell
'em,
baby?
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
There's
nothin'
you
could
do
or
say
That
could
ever
change
me
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
There's
no
one
on
Earth
that
can
save
me
Not
even
Hailie
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
My
songs
can
make
you
cry,
take
you
by
surprise
At
the
same
time,
can
make
you
dry
your
eyes
With
the
same
rhyme
See,
what
you're
seein'
is
a
genius
at
work
Which
to
me
isn't
work
So
it's
easy
to
misinterpret
it
at
first
Cause
when
I
speak,
it's
tongue-in-cheek
I'd
yank
my
fuckin'
teeth
Before
I'd
ever
bite
my
tongue,
I'd
slice
my
gums
Get
struck
by
fuckin'
lightning
twice
at
once
And
die
and
come
back
as
Vanilla
Ice's
son
And
walk
around
the
rest
of
my
life
spit
on
And
kicked
and
hit
with
shit
every
time
I
sung
Like
R.
Kelly
as
soon
as
"Bump
and
Grind"
comes
on
More
pain
inside
of
my
brain
Than
the
eyes
of
a
little
girl
inside
of
a
plane
Aimed
at
the
World
Trade
Standin'
on
Ronnie's
grave,
screamin'
at
the
sky
'Til
clouds
gather;
it's
Clyde
Mathers
and
Bonnie
Jade
And
that's
pretty
much
the
gist
of
it
The
parents
are
pissed,
but
the
kids
love
it
9
millimeter
heaters
stashed
In
two-seaters
with
meat
cleavers
I
don't
blame
you,
I
wouldn't
let
Hailie
listen
to
me
neither
There's
really
nothin'
else
to
say
I
can't
explain
it
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
A
little
help
from
Hailie
Jade
Won't
you
tell
'em,
baby?
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
There's
nothin'
you
could
do
or
say
That
could
ever
change
me
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
There's
no
one
on
Earth
that
can
save
me
Not
even
Hailie
I
think
my
dad's
gone
crazy!
Crazy!
Ha
ha
ha
ha!
You're
funny,
Daddy!
Is
this
thing
on?
Where'd
everybody
go?
Guess
who's
back?
Back
again.
Ken
is
back,
tell
some·men
Rub
my
back,
Rub
my
back,
Rub
my
back,
Rub
my
back.
Eh
Wait..Hello?
Eh..Goodnight
Listen
Now!
Psst..
Hey,
Listen
I
love
my
job
It
makes
me
feel
like...
superman
Can
you
fly?
I
can
Wanna
see?
[Chorus]
I'm
only
entertaining
you
why
Going
to
stimulate
making
you
high
And
take
you
and
I,
to
a
place
that
you
can't
see
But
I
believe
you
can
fly
I
don't
need
nobody
home
I'm
just
partying
I'm
not
your
dad,
not
your
mom,
not
your
guardian
Just
a
man
whos
on
the
mic,
so
let
me...
entertain
you
[Verse
1]
My
lyrical
content
is
constantly
undefined
No
wonder
why
I
constantly
bomb
back
To
come
back
attacks
with
constant
concepts
From
lyrics
constantly
took
out
of
context
Failure
to
communicate
with
congresses
Been
a
problem
for
the
longest
I
guess
but
Maybe
one
day
we
can
make
some
progress
Food
for
thought
see
how
long
it
takes
to
digest
Feeling
good
when
I
should
be
ashamed
Shit,
I
really
should've
fell
when
I
stood
See
I
came
like
a
flame
in
the
night
Like
a
ghost
in
the
dark,
there's
a
ray,
there's
a
light
There's
a
hope
there's
a
spark
But
when
planets
collide,
they'll
never
see
eye
to
eye
Until
they
decide
to
set
the
differences
aside
And
this
is
why
only
one
of
us
will
survive
So
children,
follow
my
lead
and
feel
the
vibe
because
[Chorus
x1]
[Verse
2]
My
music
can
be
slightly
amusing
You
shouldn't
take
lyrics
so
serious
It
might
be
confusing
Trying
to
seperate
the
truth
from
entertainment
It's
stupid
ain't
it?
I
get
sick
of
trying
to
explain
it
See
I
can
sit
and
argue
with
you
but
it
goes
beyond
Just
being
a
snot,
pointy
nosed,
bleached
blonde
Cuz'
I
came
here
to
uplift
let
your
woes
be
gone
Tell
em'
to
get
fucked
and
just
mosey
on
Constantly
movin'
constantly
using
the
constitution
As
a
form
of
restitution
Bless
the
children,
nothing
less
than
brilliant
Let
me
entertain
you
like
Robbie
Williams
I'll
be
here
when
y'all
are
gone
re-building
We're
all
revolving,
still
evolving,
still
Slim
How
many
kids
will
cop
me?
Probably
millions
But
Im'a
do
this
as
a
fuckin'
hobby
till
then...
[Chorus
X1]
[Verse
3]
My
lyrical
content
contains
subject
matter
That
sucks
up
all
these
fucked
up
young
kids
Out
of
a
long
and
great
common
denominate
Add
it
up
and
you'll
see
thats
why
I
dominate
I
try
to
stimulate
but
kids
imulate
And
mimmick
ever
move
you
make
"Slim
you're
great"
But
wait,
can't
you
see
im
only
here
to
entertain?
I
gotta
be
the
one
to
go
against
the
grain
Cuz
man,
I
see
it,
feel
it,
live
it
But
its
inhumane
for
me
to
see
you
be
influenced
And
pretend
you
ain't
But
they
don't
understand
that
i've
been
through
pain
If
you
get
to
know
me
I
can
be
a
friend
you
gain
But
you
can't
just
stand
there
and
try
to
touch
It
hurts
but
your
jealousy
probably
tears
you
up
inside
as
much
And
its
such
a
pleasure
every
button
that
I
touch
I
treasure
every
glutton
that
I
punish
in
my
lust
But
i'm

[chorus]
Monkey

Dont

the
first
move
Just

Cause
they
always
gunna
see
and

what
the
other
one

So
let
em'
come
to
you
The
rest
of
us
follow
suit
Monkey
see
monkey

Tweedle-de-tweedle-dum
If
they
really
want
it
bad
enough
well
then
they
gunna
come
Now
here
they
come
as
we
expected
now
we
just
set
em'
up
Check-mate
motherfucker
Games
over
We
won
Tweedle-de-tweedle-dum
It
doesnt
take
much
For
me
to
raise
such
a
stink
up
When
motherfuckers
hate
your
guts
You
aint
even
gotta
say
much
For
me
to
put
a
pen
to
a
blank
sheet
of
papers
Like
smearing
blood
stains
with
a
paint
brush
I
cant
explain
what
it
is
my
brain
does
But
however
it
works
its
insane
Its
plain
nutz
And
it
aint
just
my
brain
thas
dangerous
Its
a
whole
combination
of
things
It
takes
nutz
And
im
not
affriad
to
raise
the
stakes
up
I
got
a
million
bucks
in
the
banks
and
8
trucks
For
anybody
who
gets
on
the
track
and
spanks
us
Im
patiently
waiting
for
the
day
Im
anxious
To
see
the
look
on
ya
fake
mugs
When
you
thugs
go
bankrupt
Ya
drunk
Ya
aint
tough
Whatever
you
drank
musta
just
turned
ya
into
some
gangstas
This
is
me
talking
motherfucker
This
aint
drugs
You
wanna
pop,
shit
wake-up,
then
make-up
FUCK
THAT
Its
too
late
chump
now
face
up
I
pray
for
the
day
that
someone
who
spits
with
the
calliber
that
nas
and
jay
does
Opens
up
his
jaw
to
say
something
or
rattle
my
name
off
Or
rattle
the
first
thing
from
the
top
of
his
brain
off
So
i
can
blow
the
fuckin
dust
off
of
this
chainsaw
And
give
him
the
surgery
that
he
came
for
Till
i
pull
the
paint
off
I
never
been
shot
But
i
think
me
and
50
musta
been
cut
from
the
same
cloth
Cause
ive
always
came
off
Like
ja's
chain
When
they
try
to
rush
him
and
lost
And
came
back
and
gave
him
a
watch
in
exchange
for
it
I
dont
stop
The
only
thing
i
wait
for
Is
day
that
i
dont
gotta
report
to
probate
court
Cause
ima
give
ya
all
the
reason
to
hate
more
Cause
ive
been
holding
my
tounge
till
i
got
a
sprained
jaw
Alot
of
rappers
on
my
list
that
just
aint
ja
And
ima
read
that
motherfucker
off
from
april
You
pussies

soft
since

mile
When

shootin
more
than
just
paint
balls
Trust

A

But

Fuck

My

I

I

The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it

to
you
You

I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
[verse
1]
It's
sick
but
who
could
ever
predict
we'd
be
doin'
the
same
shit
We
say
that
we
do
it
for
our
baby
but
we
don't,
we
do
it
for
us
It's
lust,
'cuz
neither
one
of
us
trusts
each
other
so
we
fuck
'till
we
bust,
'till
cuss
each
other
out,
we
know
what
it's
about
Shout
'till
I
throw
you
out
the
house,
you
throw
me
out
the
house
I
throw
you
on
the
couch,
punch
you
in
the
mouth,
we
fist
fight
'till
we
turn
this
mother
out
and
apologize
after,
laughter
Pain,
it's
insane,
we're
back
in
the
same
chapter
again
And
it's
sad
but
it's
true,
when
i'm
laying
here
with
you
There
ain't
nothing
anyone
could
ever
say
or
ever
do
'cuz
[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
[verse
2]
'Cuz
I
hate
you,
do
you
hate
me?
Good,
'cuz
you're
so
fuckin
beautiful
when
you're
angry
It
makes
me
wanna
just
take
you
and
just
throw
you
on
the
bed
and
fuck
you
like
I
don't
even
know
you
You
FUCK
other
people
and
I
FUCK
other
people
You're
a
SLUT,
but
i'm
equal,
i'm
a
MUTT,
we're
both
evilin
our
ways
but
neither
one
of
us
would
ever
admit
it
'Cuz
one
of
us
would
have
one
up
on
the
other
so
forget
it
We
can
make
accusations,
people
spread
rumours
But
they
ain't
got
proof,
'till
they
do,
it's
just
the
two
of
us
You
and
me,
'cuz
any
chick
can
say
that
she's
screwin'
me
But
you
gotta
believe
it
to
a
degree
'cuz
true
indeed
If
you
didn't
I
wouldn't
be
hittin',
yeah
I
would
'Cuz
the
sex
is
too
damn
good,
if
I
ran,
who
would
I
run
to
that
would
be
this
soft
and
warm?
So
it's
off
and
on
Usually
more
off
then
on
but
at
least
we
know
that
we
Share
this
common
bond,
you're
the
only
one
I
can
fuck
without
a
condom
on,
I
hope
the
only
reason
that
I
cope
Is
'cuz
of
that
fact
and
I
can
bust
in
that,
and
that's
why
[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
[verse
3]
I
can
never
understand
it,
that's
why
I
don't
try
From
junior
high
until
we
both
die,
you
silly
hoe
why
must
we
try
Is
it
really
so
rough
that
we
must
always
call
each
other's
Billy
Goat's
Gruff
Try
to
pull
each
other's
legs
until
the
other
begs
We're
lying
to
ourself,
that's
the
beauty
of
it,
yeah
'Cuz
we
truly
love
each
other,
that's
why
we
always
fight
And
all
we
do
is
shove
each
other
every
other
fuckin'
night
And
it's
clear,
it
ain't
gonna
change,
this
pinned
up
rage
We
both
have,
we
both
feel
like
we've
been
upstaged
By
someone
else,
we
both
been
someone
else's
someone
else
The
problem
is
neither
one
wants
help,
it's
an
addiction
And
it
can't
be
fixed,
our
family's
mixed
up
There's
a
baby
sister
in
the
mix
and
it
hurts
'cuz
the
pieces
to
the
puzzle
don't
fit
And
anybody
who
thinks
he
knows
us
doesn't
know
shit
And
they're
probably
just
tired
of
hearing
it
all
the
time
on
every
song
Every
lyric
and
every
rhyme,
all
the
hoopla,
all
of
the
woopty
woo
What
you
put
me
through,
fuckin'
woopty
do
But
I
won't
be
made
a
fool
of,
if
this
is
true
love
You
wouldn't
do
what
you
did
last
time,
you
wouldn't
screw
up
This
time,
'cuz
this
time
girl
i'm
tellin
you
what
You
do
it
again
and
i'm
fuckin'
you
up
'cuz
no
matter
[chorus
2]
What
you
say,
what
you
do
I'ma
hunt
you
down
'till
I
find
you
No
matter
where
you
run,
i'll
be
right
there
Right
behind
you
in
your
nightmares
So
much
for
them
flowers,
and
the
candy
All
the
times
that
you
threw
it
back
at
me
Told
me
you
hate
me,
you
'gon
hate
me
more
When
you
find
out
you
can't
escape
me,
whore
[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more

voice]
Here
we
go...
Now
once
upon
a
time
not
long
ago
There
was
a
little
rapper
about
to
blow
But
his
album
came
and
it
was
not
good
I
think
it
went
lead
or
double
copper
wood
So
the
silly
little
fans
they
were
mislead
By
a
nerdy
internet
computer
hip-hop
head
"Me
and
you,
'Clef,
we're
gonna
make
some
cash
Grab
the
silver
paint
and
let's
paint
my
ass"
Hey
mister,
would
ya
care
to
bare
witness
to
The
ass-whippin'
I'm
about
to
administer
To
this
ass-kissin'
little
vaginal
blister
Stanabis,
little
Marshall
Mathers'
sister
And
in
this
corner,
we
have
the
mister
Not
havin'
it,
it's
the
mad
sinister
Dr.
Evil
with
his
bag
of
tricks
for
this
little
antagonist
faggot
dick-suckin'
Ex-LL
Cool
J
fan
from
Windsor
I'm
'bout
to
murder
little
Kenny
fag
Keniff-sta
You
bastard
I
ain't
wanna
have
to
diss
ya
Canabis,
where
the
fuck
you
at?
I
miss
ya!
[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch,
oh
Can-i-bitch
Where
for
art
thou
Can-i-bitch?
Please
tell
me
what
happened
with
That
style
that
you
were
rappin'
with
Can-i-bitch,
oh
Can-i-bitch
Are
you
from
Los
Angeles
New
York
or
just
a
janitor
From
Canada?
Oh
Can-i-bitch
Now
at
first
I
ain't
really
understand
the
shit
Picture
me
for
a
second
and
imagine
it
Chillin'
in
the
Bat-Mansion
and
relaxin'
When
all
a
sudden
some
bullshit
comes
across
the
scanners
It's
Can-i-bitch
on
some
"Stan
Lives"
shit
It
creeped
me
out
at
first.
Man
this
is
sick
For
me,
being
just
a
sick,
this
conflict
Gets
my
dick
harder
than
arithmetic
And
I
know
how
you
jealous
ones
envy
I
shoulda
knew
better
from
the
first
few
letters
you
sent
me
The
first
two
letters
you
were
tellin'
me
shit
Like
you
respect
me,
like
any
other
regular
MC
The
third
letter
you
ask
how
come
I
ain't
return
None
of
the
messages
at
Shady
Records
you
left
me
The
fourth
letter:
"Slim,
you
really
startin'
to
upset
me!"
The
fifth
letter
told
me
you
were
comin'
to
get
me
The
sixth
letter
there's
a
bomb
threat
in
our
building
This
crazy
motherfucker's
really
tryin'
to
kill
me!
So
I
went
back
and
read
the
first
few
letters
that
said
Some
shit
about
a
message
you
left
Oh
shit,
that's
not
an
"E"
that's
an
"A"
This
dude
wants
to
leave
me
a
"massage,"
he's
gay!!
Right
away
I'm
on
the
phone
with
Dr.
Dre
We
got
a
bogey!
(Marshall
I'm
on
the
way)
[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch,
oh
Can-i-bitch
Where
for
art
thou
Can-i-bitch?
Please
tell
me
what
happened
with
That
style
that
you
were
rappin'
with
Can-i-bitch,
oh
Can-i-bitch
Are
you
from
Los
Angeles
New
York
or
just
a
janitor
From
Canada?
Oh
Can-i-bitch
So
in
two
seconds
flat
Dre's
at
my
crib
The
funny
thing
is
we
both
know
where
this
kid
lives
And
neither
one
of
us
have
Canadian
citizenship
Shit.
Oh
Dre,
wait
a
mintue
that's
it
All
we
gotta
do
is
use
a
bit
of
turbo
boost
We
can
fly
over
the
border
"Let's
go"
[WOOSH!]
So
we're
off
to
Toronto
and
we're
gainin'
speed
[BOOSH!]
(What
was
that?
Oh)
Jermaine
Dupri
Fuck
It,
keep
goin'
no
time
to
waste
Wait,
backup
hit
him
one
more
time
in
case
Okay
..
fuck
now
he's
draggin'
under
the
car
Oh
well,
only
30
more
thousand
miles
Meanwhile
me
and
Dre
are
tryin'
to
conversate
Just
tryin'
to
find
a
reason
for
the
constant
hate
And
tryin'
to
figure
out
what
happened
to
'Germaine
Propaine'
"He
couldn't
have
fell
off
that
hard"
Ain't
no
way
"What
happened
to
the
way
you
was
rappin'
when
you
was
scandalous
That
Canibus
turned
into
a
television
evangelist"
Plus
he
raps
with
his
regular
voice
[BOOSH!
BOOSH!]
[BOOSH!
BOOSH!]
(What
was
that?)
Pet
Shop
Boys
So
we
pull
up
to
the
bridge
where
he
last
was
spotted
His
corpse
was
still
movin'
but
his
ass
was
rotted
He
kinda
smelled
a
little
like
Courtney
Love
I
figure
if
I
stick
him
with
a
fork
he's
done
So
I
stabbed
him
twice,
kept
jabbin',
Christ
He
won't
die,
this
guy's
like
a
battered
wife
He's
like
Kim,
he
keeps
comin'
back
for
more
But
he
won't
fight
back
I
cracked
his
jaw
Hold
up,
'Bis
quit
foldin'
up!
Punch
me
in
the
chest!
Make
my
shoulders
touch!
Do
somethin'!
At
least
one
punchline
C'mon
till
the
meter
reads
9-9-9-
ty-nine
percent
of
my
fans
are
blonde
'Bis
c'mon
answer
me
man
respond!
Tell
me
'bout
the
sun
rain
moon
and
stars
Intergalatical
metaphors
from
Mars!
Raw
to
the
floor,
raw
like
Reservoir
Dogs
Bite
another
line
from
Redman's
song!
Suddenly
the
stub
from
a
dead
man's
arm
From
a
midget
reaches
out
from
under
the
car
It's
JD,
this
motherfucker
won't
die
neither
Dre
starts
sprayin'
him
with
cans
of
ether
We
stomped
the
bitch
and
then
stopmed
the
bitch
again
(Compton!)
Detroit
bitch!
Talk
some
shit
again!
Stomp
him!
(switch
feet)
Stomp
him!
(switch
again!)
Dre
alright
he's
dead
dog,
quit
kickin
him!
I
think
Stanabis
jumped
off
the
bridge
again
(Damn)
He
disappeared
yo
he's
gone
he
did
it
again
[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch,
oh
Can-i-bitch
Where
for
art
thou
Can-i-bitch?
Please
tell
me
what
happened
with
That
style
that
you
were
rappin'
with
Can-i-bitch,
oh
Can-i-bitch
Are
you
from
Los
Angeles
New
York
or
just
a
janitor
From
Canada?
Oh
Can-i-bitch
[Intro]
Yo,
check
it
out,
it's
fucked
up,
and
I
don't
see
either
one
of
us
budging
[Verse]
I'm
withholding
my
anger
Though
I'd
like
to
be
the
strangler
Of
this
punk
ass
little
pussy's
puny
neck
It's
my
right
to
insist
That
he
acknowledge
my
existence
But
he
just
displays
complete
lack
of
respect
That's
what
he
says
to
himself
As
he
uses
magazines
to
trash
me
As
he
sits
with
both
feet
up
at
his
desk
Smokes
a
bag
of
his
weed
And
starts
imagining
things
And
he
just
can't
see
that
he's
manically
depressed
And
in
his
jealousy
and
envy
It
just
whirls
him
in
a
frenzy
As
he
turns
on
MTV
and
sees
my
face
He
don't
exist
in
this
world
So
he
just
twists
and
he
twirls
Spirals
and
spins
till
he
hurls
himself
into
rage
And
it's
destroying
him
slowly
Cuz
he
does
not
even
know
me
Even
though
he
sees
me
everywhere
he
goes
So
he
just
tortures
himself
He
has
no
fortune
and
wealth
So
he
extorts
someone
else
to
get
his
dough
And
now
he's
acting
like
a
bully
So
he
tries
to
push
and
pull
me
But
he
knows
that
he
can't
fool
me
so
he's
mad
He
has
no
choice
but
to
scream
And
raise
his
voice
up
at
me
Cuz
it
annoys
him
to
see
that
I
ain't
scared
[Chorus]
You
aint
no
motherfucking
(bully)
And
I
aint
bowing
to
no
motherfucking
(bully)
I
won't
allow
it,
aint
gon
coward
to
no
(bully)
I'll
be
damned
if
I
don't
stand
up
to
a
(bully)
Fight
like
a
man
and
throw
my
hands
up
to
a
(bully...)
And
I
know
it
must
be
fucking
with
you
emotionall(y...)
[Verse]
Now
I'm
not
trying
to
make
no
more
enemies
No
more
unfortunately
There's
so
many
motherfuckers
that
just
are
They
just
keep
pounding
at
me
Now
that
I'm
down
with
50
Suddenly
now
I
got
beef
with
this
faggot
Ja'
[laughter]
But
his
ass
is
such
a
puppet
Irv
could
shove
his
whole
hand
up
it
And
just
make
him
say
what
he
wants
him
to
say
But
Suge
has
Irv's
on
a
string
And
Irv's
so
nervous
that
he
Says
anything
to
this
man
to
keep
him
at
bay
So
now
Ja
thinks
that
he's
so
tough
And
Murder
Inc.'s
the
big
bad
wolf
And
they
go
huff
and
puff
and
blow
our
label
down
But
our
building's
made
out
of
bricks
So
you
ain't
taking
out
shit
I
dawg
you
just
did
a
song
with
Bobby
Brown
So
now
you
try
to
pull
a
race
card
And
it
backfires
in
your
face
hard
Cuz
you
know
we
don't
play
that
black
and
white
shit
Plus
this
stylist
that
you
fucked
When
you
was
ecstasied
up
Was
just
a
man
who's
dressed
up
as
a
white
bitch
[Chorus]
You
must
be
taking
to
much
(E...)
[Verse]
Now
what
bothers
me
the
most
About
hip-hop
is
we
so
close
To
picking
up
where
we
left
off
with
Big
and
Pac
We
just
lost
Jam
Master
J
Big
L
got
blasted
away
Plus
we
lost
Bugs,
Slang
Toungue,
and
Freaky
Ta
It's
like
a
never-ending
cycle
That
just
seems
to
come
full
circle
Everybody's
gotta
be
so
fucking
hard
I'm
not
excluding
myself
Cuz
I
been
stupid
as
well
I
been
known
to
lose
it
when
someone
says
something
smart
But
as
we
grow
as
men
We
learn
to
let
shit
go,
but
then
again
There's
only
so
much
bullshit
we
can
really
stand
We
all
got
reps
to
uphold
When
someone
steps
on
our
toes
It's
no
exception,
it
goes
for
every
man
But
if
Irv
really
gave
a
fuck
About
Ja
like
he
claims
he
does
He'd
wake
him
up
and
make
his
boy
get
off
them
drugs
But
he
just
keeps
feeding
him
pills
So
if
that
E
doesn't
kill
him
Someone
from
G-Unit
will
and
I
ain't
buzzed
Dawg,
I'm
talking
to
you
straight
If
the
situation
escalates
Any
worse,
we're
gonna
lose
another
soldier
to
this
game
And
if
I
get
killed
for
this
rap
I
got
a
million
in
cash
That
says
I
will
get
you
back
in
Halie's
name
[Chorus]
Irvine,
get
your
boy
off
that
(E...)
[Spoken]
Get
at
me,
dawg
Holla
(feat.
D12)
Good
mornin
Haha,
wake
your
mother
fuckin
arses
up
Yo
what
is
the
what?
Well
come
on
then,
you
know
what
time
it
is
Stop
sleepin
on
my
roof
bitch
For
whatever
it's
worth
it's
worth
me
havin
my
arse
whipped
Cause
I'ma
have
the
last
lift
that
ever
gets
arse
squished
I
just
can't
get
past
these
little
pissants
That
wanna
be
rauny
bad
asses
so
bad
And
they
so
mad
they
can't
stand
it
Cause
we
can
and
they
can't
spit
(Haawk)
And
they
can't
handle
it
like
a
man
And
that's
when
it
just
happens
And
I
snap
and
it's
a
wrap,
and
it's
a
scrap
an
then
it
isn't
rap
is
it?
Hip-Hop
isn't
a
sport
anymore
when
you
got
to
go
and
resort
back
into
that
shit
Maybe
I'm
old
fashioned
but
my
pashion
Is
to
smash
anyone
rappin
without
havin
a
slappin
Believe
me
I'd
much
rather
pick
up
a
pencil
than
a
pistol
but
I'm
pissed
now
But
it
all
depends
on
just
how
far
it
get's
took
on
the
mic
Cause
I'm
tellin
you
right
now
your
not
gonna
like
it
Cause
if
I
get
pushed
over
the
edge
then
I'm
pullin
you
with
me
You
poke
a
stick
at
a
big
boy
you
get
bit
B
These
words
stick
to
you
like
crazy
glue
When
you
diss
me
cause
they
just
bounce
off
me
like
bullets
do
fifty!
I'm
the
beatiful-est
thing
and
your
gonna
miss
me
when
I'm
gone
Like
Kieth
Murry
when
he
threw
a
stool
and
hit
a
girl
acci-dently
(argghhh!!)
I
do
this
for
Swifty,
Kon
and
Kuniva,
Bizzy
&
Proof
are
you
with
me?
[Chorus:
Eminem]
Come

In

Fuck

The

In

death
project,

You

It

When

Either

or
we'll

You

Your

I

and
we
won't
even
keep

a

I

from
a
mind
of
a
mental

When

You

Yo

But
so
what
this
beef
is
like
'What
tha
fuck
did
he
say
in
his
rap
Em?'
I
can
see
that
he's
just
a
punk
I
mean
these
niggas
squeeze
on
me
Please
I'm
seeing
guts
I
don't
need
no
enemies,
as
my
family
a
couple
trucks
Am
I
empty
seein
them
??
I
emtpy
out
them
??
to
fight
you
In
front
of
every
reporter
that
I
don't
like
No
need
for
metaphores
I
get
yours
across
when
I
write
So
emotions
enough
to
say
"fuck
you
bitch,
and
I
don't
like
you,
WHAT!"
I
might
as
well
give
this
up
like
heavy
sales
And
just
fuck
an
leave
D12
and
this
blunt
We
can't
self
destruct
I've
never
felt
it
this
much
Come
on
fellas,
get
up
We
got
to
fight
like
Bugs
last
night
of
his
life
[Kon
Artis]
I
walk
with
a
limp,
pistol
hangin
off'a
tha
hip
I'm
awkward
and
quick
enough
an
sick
when
sparkin
a
fith
Your
carcus
is
split
even
the
beef
is
partially
thick
We
can't
take
you
serious,
you
a
comedy
skit
You
probaly
wish
that
you
could
be
out
shootin
them
G's
But
the
only
thing
you
shoot
is
the
breeze
I
can't
believe
you
speaking
on
movin
key's
But
every
time
we
hear
you
kick
it
The
only
thing
you
sellin
is
wolf
tickets
I
look
wicked
cause
niggas
will
test
your
nut
sack

Lord
please

for
what
I

For
I

what
I've
done
[Chorus]
Father
please
forgive
me
for
I
know
not
what
I
do
I
just
never
had
the
chance
to
ever
meet
you
Therefore
I
did
not
know
that
I
would
grow
to
be
My
mother's
evil
seed
and
do
these
evil
deeds
Momma
had
a
baby
and
it's
head
popped
off
(head
popped
off,
head
popped
off,
head
popped
off,
head
popped
off,
head
popped
off)
My
momma
don't
want
me,
the
next
thing
I
know
I'm
gettin'
dropped
off
(gettin'
dropped
off,
gettin'
dropped
off,
gettin'
dropped
off,
gettin'
dropped

Ring
ring
ring,
on
the
door

of
the
next
door
neighbors
on
their
front
porch
(their
front
porch,
their
front
porch,
their
front
porch,
their
front
porch)
But
they
didn't
want
me
neither
so
they
left
me
on
someone
elses
lawn
(elses
lawn,
elses
lawn,
elses
lawn)
Till
somebody
finally
took
me
in,
my
great
aunt,
uncle
Edna
'n
Charles
(Edna

Charles,
Edna
'n
Charles,
Edna

Charles,
Edna

They
were
the
ones
who
were
left
in
charge
My
elementary
they
gang
up
on
me
and
sang
this
song
(sang
this
song,
sang
this
song,
sang
this
song,
sang
this
song)
It
went
a
little
something
like
mary
had
a
little
lamb,
little
lamb,
little
lamb
Debbie
had
a
Satan
spawn,
Satan
spawn
Momma
why
do
they
keep
saying
this
I
just
dont
understand,
understand
And
by
the
way,
where's
my
dad?
[Chorus]
Predominantly,
predominantly,
everythings
always
predominantly
Predominantly
white,
predominantly
black
Well,
what
about
me,
where
does
that
leave
me
Well
I
guess
that
I'm
between
predominantly
both
of
'em
I
think
if
I
hear
that
fuckin'
word
again
I'mma
scream
While
I'm
projectile
vomiting,
what
do
I
look
like,
a
comedian
to
you?
Do
you
think
that
I'm
kidding?
What
do
I
look
like
some
kind
of
idi-wait
a
minute,
shit,
don't
answer
that
Why
am
I
so
misunderstood?
Why
do
I
go
through
so
much
bullshit,
it
sucks
bullshit,
it's
tush
mull
bish
Woe
is
me,
there
goes
poor
Marshall
again
Whining
about
his
millions
and
his
mansion
and
his
sorrow
he's
always
drownin'
in
And
the
dad
that
he
never
had,
and
how
his
childhood
was
so
bad
And
how
his
mom
was
a
dope
addict,
and
his
ex-wife
how
they
go
at
it
Man
I'd
hate
to
have
it,
as
bad
as
that
Mr.
Mathers
claims
he
had
it
I
can't
imagine
it,
that
little
rich
poor
white
bastard
Needs
to
take
some
of
that
cash
out
the
bank
and
take
a
bath
in
it
Man
if
I
only
had
half
of
it.
If
you
only
knew
the
half
of
it
[Chorus]
Evil
deeds,
while
I
plant
these
evil
seeds
Please
release
me
from
these
deamons
I
never
had
any
of
this
shit
planned
ma,
please
believe
I
don't
wanna
be
Satan's
spawn,
never
got
the
chance
to
say
I'm
sorry
Now
look
at
all
the
pain
I
caused
Dear
Santa
Clause,
why
you
not
comin'
this
year
again
What
did
I
do
that
was
so
bad
to
deserve
this
Everything
could
have
been
so
perfect
But
life
ain't
a
fairytale,
I'm
about
to
be
hoist
up
in
the
air
Forty
feet
below
me,
there's
people
everywhere
I
don't
even
know
what
it
feel
like,
they
know
me
cuz
I'm
in
this
ferris
wheel
And
all
i
wanna
do
is
go
to
the
mall
and
take
hailie
on
the
carousel
Without
this
crowd
everywhere
I
go,
but
life
is
like
a
merry-go-round
Here
we
go
now,
doe
see
doe
now,
curtains
up,
the
show
must
go
now
Ring
around
the
rosie,
the
shows
over,
you
can
all
go
home
now
But
the
curtain
just
don't
close
for
me,
this
ain't
how
fame
is
supposed
to
be
Where's
the
switch
I
could
just
turn
off
and
on,
this
ain't
what
I
chose
to
be
So
please
god,
give
me
the
strength
to
have
what
it
takes
to
carry
on
Till
I
pass
50
back
the
baton,
the
camera's
on,
my
soul
is
gone
[Chorus
x2]
[Eminem]
There's
not
much
you
could
do
or
say
to
phase
me
People
think
I'm
a
little
bit
crazy
I
get
it
from
all
angles,
even
occasionally
Doc
Dre-zie'll
Have
to
step
in
every
once
in
a
while
to
save
me
To
make
me
stop
and
think
about
it
'fore
I
just
say
things
Sometimes
I
forget
what
other
people
just
may
think
A
lot
of
rappers
finally
wouldn't
know
how
to
take
me
If
they
heard
some
shit,
I'd
lay
the
tape
'fore
they
erase
me
I
maybe
a
little
too
fast
paced
and
racy
Sometimes
the
average
listener
rewinds
and
plays
me
twenty
times
cuz
I
say
so
many
rhymes,
it
may
seem
like
I'm
goin
too
fast
cuz
my
mind
is
racing
And
I
could
give
a
fuck
what
category
you
place
me
Long
as
when
I'm
pushing
up
daisies
and
gone
As
long
as
you
place
me
amongst
one
of
them
greats
When
I
hit
the
heavenly
gates
I'll
be
cool
beside
Jay-Z
For
every
single
die
hard
fan
who
embraced
me
I'm
thankful
for
the
talent
in
which
God
gave
me
And
I'm
thankful
for
the
environment
that
he
placed
me
Believe
it
or
not,
I
thank
my
mom
for
how
she
raised
me
In
the
neighborhood
daily,
they
jumped
and
chased
me
It
only
made
me
what
I
am
today,
see
Regardless
of
what
anybody
believes
who
hates
me
You
ain't
gonna
make
or
break
me
Tryna
strip
me
of
my
credibility
and
make
me
look
fake,
G
You're
only
gonna
be
in
for
a
rude
awakening
Cuz
sooner
or
later
you
haters
are
all
gonna
face
me
And
when
you
face
me
with
all
the
shit
you've
been
saving
to
say
to
me
You
had
all
this
time
to
think
about
it
Now
don't
pussy
out
and
try
to
about
face
me
Cuz
I've
been
patiently
waiting
for
the
day
That
we
finally
meet
in
the
same
place
to
see
[Chorus
x2
-
Nate
Dogg]
No
matter
how
many
battles
I
been
in
and
won
No
matter
how
many
magazines
on
my
nuts
No
matter
how
many
MC's
I
eat
up
Ooh
ooh,
it's
never
enough
[50
Cent]
My
flow's
untouchable
now
you
gotta
face
it
Uh
oh,
it
gets
worse
when
I
go
back
to
the
basics
You
go
say
the
wrong
shit
and
get
your
face
split
The
smell
of
victory,
love
it
so
much
I
can
taste
it
I
spot
my
target,
blaze
it,
direct
hit
Graze
it,
your
peace
talk,
save
it
You
shit
sounds
dated,
you're
overrated
I'm
obligated
to
study
your
moves
then
crush
you
mutherfuckers
If
I'm
the
best
and
the
worst,
then
God's
gift
is
a
curse
Soldier
trained
to
destroy,
you
payin'
attention
boy?
I
spit
shit,
slick
shit,
so
quick
you
miss
it
To
be
specific
I
go
ballistic
as
hieroglyphic
My
music
is
a
drug,
press
play,
you
ain't
gotta
sniff
it
Chew
it
or
pop
it,
roll
a
bag
or
chop
it
Get
your
high
over
and
over,
but
you
gotta
cop
it
When
it's
hot,
it's
hot
Your
hatin'
is
undeniable,
stop
it
[Chorus
x2]
[Intro]
What
we
have
to
do
is
deal
with
it
when
these
individuals
are
young
enough.
If
you
wish
to
be
saved,
not
in
a
religious
sense
but
not
to
constitute
what
this
country
at
times
calls
if
or
which
over.
We
seem
to
be
approaching
an
age
of
the
gross.
We
all
have
this
idea
that
we
should
move
up
from
our
parents
station
and
each
generation
should
do
a
little
bit
better.
[Verse
1-
Eminem]
Come
on,
let's
cut
the
bullshit
enough
Let's
get
it
started,
let's
start
addressing
this
issue
and
open
it
up
Let's
take
this
shit
back
to
bassmint
And
we
can
disscuss
statements
thats
made
on
this
tape
And
its
whole
origin
of
the
music
that
we
all
know
and
love
The
music
that
we
all
enjoy
the
music
you
all
accuse
me
of
tryna
destroy
Let's
rewind
it
to
89
when
I
was
a
boy
on
the
east
side
of
Detroit
Crossin
8
Mile
into
Warren,
into
hick
territory
I'd
like
to
share
a
story,
this
is
my
story
and
cant
no
body
tell
it
for
me
You
will
well
inform
me,
I
am
well
aware
that
I
don't
belong
here
You've
made
that
perfectly
clear,
I
get
my
ass
kicked
damn
near
everywhere
From
Bel-Air
shopping
center
just
for
stopping
in
there
From
the
black
side
all
the
way
to
the
white
side
Okay
there's
a
bright
side
a
day
that
I
might
slide
You
may
call
it
a
past
I
call
it
haulin
my
ass
Through
that
patch
of
grass
over
them
railroad
tracks
Oh
them
railroad
tracks,
them
old
railroad
tracks
Them
good
old
notorious
oh
well
known
tracks
[Chorus
x2]
Come
on
lets
go
back
Follow
the
yellow
brick
road
as
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with
me
as
I
take
you
through
this
nifty
little
place
I
once
used
to
call
home
sweet
home
[Verse
2-
Eminem]
I
roam
the
streets
so
much
they
call
me
a
drifter
Sometimes
I
stick
up
a
thumb
just
to
hitch
hike
Just
to
get
picked
up
to
get
me
a
lift
to
8
mile
and
Van
Dyke
And
steal
a
god
damn
bike
from
somebody's
backyard
And
drop
it
off
at
the
park
that
was
the
half
way
mark
To
meet
Kim
had
to
walk
back
to
her
mama's
on
Chalmers
after
dark
To
sneak
me
in
the
house
when
I'm
kicked
out
my
mom's
Thats
about
the
time
I
first
met
Proof
with
Goofy
Gary
on
the
steps
At
Osbourne
handing
out
some
flyers,
he
was
doin
some
talent
shows
At
Centerline
High,
I
had
told
him
to
stop
by
and
check
this
out
sometime
He
looked
at
me
like
I'm
out
my
mind
shook
his
head
like
white
boys
dont
know
how
to
rhyme
I
spit
out
a
line
and
rhymed
birthday
with
first
place
And
we
both
had
the
same
rhymes
that
sound
alike
We
was
on
the
same
shit
that
Big
Daddy
Kane
shit
with
compound
syllables
sound
combined
From
that
day
we
was
down
to
ride
somehow
we
knew
we'd
meet
again
somewhere
down
the
line
[Chorus
x2]
Come
on
lets
go
back
Follow
the
yellow
brick
road
as
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with
me
as
I
take
you
through
this
nifty
little
place
I
once
used
to
call
home
sweet
home
[Verse
3-
Eminem]
My
first
year
in
9th
grade,
can't
forget
that
day
at
school
It
was
cool
till
your
man
MC
Sham
came
through
And
said
that
Puma's
The
Brand
'cause
the
clan
makes
troops
It
was
rumors
but
man
god
damned
they
flew
Musta
been
true
because
man
we
done
banned
they
shoes
I
had
the
new
ones
the
Cool
J,
Ice
land
swayed
too
And
we
just
through
them
in
the
trash
like
they
yesterday's
news
Guess
who
came
through
next,
X
clam
debut
Professor
X
and
glorious
exists
in
a
state
of
red,
black,
and
green
With
a
key
sissies
now
with
this
bein
a
new
trend
We
don't
fit
in
crackas
is
out
with
Cactus
albums
Blackness
is
in,
African
symbols
and
medallions
Represents
black
power
and
we
ain't
know
what
it
meant
Me
and
my
man
Howard
and
would
go
to
the
mall
with
'em
All
over
our
necks
like
we're
showin
'em
off
not
knowin
at
all
We
was
bein
laughed
at
you
ain't
even
half
black
You
ain't
supposed
to
have
that
homie
let
me
grab
that
And
that
Flavor
Flave
clock
we
gon'
have
to
snatch
that
All
I
remember
is
meetin
back
at
Manix's
basement
Sayin
how
we
hate
this,
our
races
wit
dope
the
x
clan
take
this
Which
reminds
me
back
in
89
me
and
Kim
broke
up
for
the
first
time
She
was
tryna
two
time
me
and
there
was
this
black
girl
At
our
school
who
thought
I
was
cool
cuz
I
rapped
so
she
was
kinda
eyein
me
And
oh
the
irony
guess
what
her
name
was
ain't
even
gon'
say
it
plus
The
same
color
hair
as
hers
was
and
blue
contacts
and
a
pair
of
jugs
The
bombest
god
damn
girl
in
our
whole
school
if
I
could
pull
it
Not
only
would
I
become
more
popular
but
I
would
be
able
to
piss
Kim
off
at
the
same
time
But
it
backfired
I
was
supposed
to
dump
her
but
she
dumped
me
for
this
black
guy
And
thats
the
last
I
ever
seen
or
heard
or
spoke
to
the
oh
foolish
pride
girl
But
I've
heard
people
say
they
heard
the
tape
and
it
ain't
that
bad
But
it
was
I
singled
out
a
whole
race
and
for
that
apologize
I
was
wrong
cuz
no
matter
what
color
a
girl
is
she
still
a
hoe
[Chorus
x2]
Come
on
lets
go
back
Follow
the
yellow
brick
road
as
we
go
on
another
episode
Journey
with
me
as
I
take
you
through
this
nifty
little
place
I
once
used
to
call
home
sweet
home
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart,
left
right
left,
we
all
fall
down...
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left,
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
I'm
supposed
to
be
the
soldier
Who
never
blows
his
composure
Even
though
I
hold
the
weight
of
the
whole
world
on
my
shoulders,
I
ain't
never
supposed
to
show
it
My
crew
ain't
supposed
to
know
it
Even
if
it
means
going
toe
to
toe
with
a
Benzino
It
don't
matter
I'd
never
drag
them
in
battles
that
I
can
handle
'Less
I
absolutely
have
to,
I'm
supposed
to
set
an
example
I
need
to
be
the
leader,
my
crew
looks
for
me
to
guide
'em
If
some
shit
ever
does
pop
off,
I'm
supposed
to
be
beside
'em
That
Ja
shit,
I
tried
to
squash
it
It
was
too
late
to
stop
it
There's
a
certain
line
you
just
don't
cross,
and
he
crossed
it
I
heard
him
say
Hailie's
name
on
a
song
And
I
just
lost
it
it
was
crazy
The
shit
went
way
beyond
some
Jay
Z
and
Nas
shit
And
even
though
the
battle
is
won,
I
feel
like
we
lost
it
I
spent
so
much
energy
on
it,
honestly
I'm
exhausted
And
I'm
so
caught
in
it
I
almost
feel
I'm
the
one
who
caused
it
This
ain't
what
I'm
in
hip
hop
for,
it's
not
why
I
got
in
it
That
was
never
my
object,
for
someone
to
get
killed
Why
would
I
want
to
destroy
something
I
helped
build?
It
wasn't
my
intentions,
my
intentions
were
good
I
went
through
my
whole
career
without
ever
mentioning
And
that
was
just
outta
respect,
for
not
running
my
mouth
And
talking
about
something
that
I
knew
nothing
about
Plus
Dre
told
me
stay
out,
this
just
wasn't
my
beef
So
I
did,
I
just
fell
back,
watched
and
gritted
my
teeth
While
he's
all
over
TV
Down-talking
the
man
who
literally
saved
my
life
Like,
fuck
it,
I
understand
This
is
business,
and
this
shit
just
isn't
none
of
my
business
I'm
still
knowing
this
shit
could
pop
off
at
any
minute,
cause
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
There
used
to
be
a
time
when
you
could
just
say
a
rhyme
and
Wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
one
of
your
people
dyin'
But
now
it's
elevated
Cause
once
you
put
someone's
kids
in
it
The
shit
gets
escalated
it
ain't
just
words
no
more,
is
it?
It's
a
different
ball
game
You
call
names
and
you
ain't
just
rappin'
We
actually
tried
to
stop
the
50
and
Ja
beef
from
happenin'
Me
and
Dre
had
sat
with
him
Kicked
it
and
had
a
chat
with
him
And
asked
him
not
to
start
it,
he
wasn't
gonna
go
after
him
Until
Ja
started
yappin'
in
magazines
how
he
stabbed
him
Fuck
it,
"50,
smash
him!
Mash
him
and
let
him
have
it!"
Meanwhile
my
attention's
pulled
in
another
direction
Some
receptionist
at
the
Source
Who
answers
phones
at
his
desk
Has
an
erection
for
me
and
thinks
that
I'll
be
his
resurrection
Tries
to
blow
the
dust
off
his
mic
and
make
a
new
record
But
now
he's
fucked
the
game
up,
cause
one
of
the
ways
I
came
up,
Was
through
that
publication
The
same
one
that
made
me
famous
Now
the
owner
of
it
has
got
a
grudge
against
me
for
nothin'?
Well,
fuck
it,
that
mothafucka
could
get
it
too,
fuck
him
then!
But
I'm
so
busy
being
pissed
off,
I
don't
stop
to
think
That
we
just
inherited
50's
beef
with
Murder
Inc
And
he's
inherited
mine,
which
is
fine
Ain't
like
either
of
us
mind
We
still
have
soldiers
that's
on
the
front
line
That's
willing
to
die
for
us
as
soon
as
we
give
the
orders
Never
to
extort
us,
strictly
to
show
they
support
us
And
maybe
shout
'em
out
in
a
rap
or
up
in
the
chorus
To
show
'em
we
love
'em
back
And
let
them
know
how
important
it
is
To
have
Runyon
Avenue
soldiers
up
in
our
corners
Their
loyalty
to
us
is
worth
more
than
any
award
is
But
I
ain't
tryin'
to
have
none
of
my
people
hurt
or
murdered
It
ain't
worth
it,
I
can't
think
of
a
perfecter
way
to
word
it
Than
to
just
say
that
I
love
y'all
too
much
to
see
the
verdict
I'll
walk
away
from
it
all
'fore
I
let
it
go
any
further
But
don't
get
it
twisted,
it's
not
a
plea
that
I'm
coppin'
I'm
just
willing
to
be
the
bigger
man
if
y'all
can
quit
poppin'
Off
at
your
jaws,
well,
then
I
can
Cause
frankly
I'm
sick
of
talkin'.
I'm
not
going
to
let
someone
else's
coffin
rest
on
my
conscience,
cause
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
I
pledge
allegiance
to
the
flag
of
the
United
States
of
America
And
to
the
Republic
for
which
it
stands
One
nation
under
God
Indivisible...
It
feels
so
good
to
be
back..
I
scrutinize
every
word,
memorize
every
line
I
spit
it
once,
refuel
and
re-energize
and
rewind
I
give
sight
to
the
blind,
my
insight
through
the
mind
I
exercise
my
right
to
express
when
I
feel
it's
time
It's
just
all
in
your
mind,
what
you
interpret
it
as
I
say
to
fight,
you
take
it
as
I'mma
whip
someone's
ass
If
you
don't
understand,
don't
even
bother
to
ask
A
father
who
has
grown
up
with
a
fatherless
past
Who
has
blown
up
now
to
rap
phenomenon
that
has
Or
at
least
shows
no
difficulty
multi-task
And
in
juggling
both
perhaps
mastered
his
craft
Slash
entrepreneur
who
has
held
onto
few
more
rap
acts
Who's
had
a
few
obstacles
thrown
his
way
through
the
last
half
Of
his
career
typical
manure
moving
past
that
Mr.
kisses
ass
crack,
he's
a
class
act
Rubber
band
man,
yea
he
just
snaps
back
[Chorus:]
Come
along
follow
me
as
I
lead
through
the
darkness
As
I
provide
just
enough
spark
that
we
need
to
proceed
Carry
on,
give
me
hope,
give
me
strength
Come
with
me
and
I
won't
steer
you
wrong
Put
your
faith
and
your
trust
as
I
guide
us
through
the
fog
To
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
We
gonna
fight,
we
gonna
charge,
we
gonna
stomp,
we
gonna
march
Through
the
swamp,
we
gonna
mosh
through
the
marsh
Take
us
right
through
the
doors
(c'mon)
All
the
people
up
top
on
the
side
and
the
middle
Come
together
lets
all
bomb
and
swamp
just
a
little
Just
let
it
gradually
build
from
the
front
to
the
back
All
you
can
see
is
a
sea
of
people
some
white
and
some
black
Don't
matter
what
color,
all
that
matters
we
gathered
together
To
celebrate
for
the
same
cause
don't
matter
the
weather
If
it
rains
let
it
rain,
yea
the
wetter
the
better
They
ain't
gonna
stop
us
they
can't,
we
stronger
now
more
than
ever
They
tell
us
no
we
say
yea,
they
tell
us
stop
we
say
go
Rebel
with
a
rebel
yell,
raise
hell
we
gonna
let
em
know
Stomp,
push,
shove,
mush,
Fuck
Bush,
until
they
bring
our
troops
home
(c'mon)
[Chorus]
Imagine
it
pouring,
it's
raining
down
on
us
Mosh
pits
outside
the
oval
office
Someone's
tryina
tell
us
something,
Maybe
this
is
god
just
sayin'
we're
responsible
For
this
monster,
this
coward,
That
we
have
empowered
This
is
Bin
Laden,
look
at
his
head
noddin'
How
could
we
allow
something
like
this
without
pumping
our
fists
Now
this
is
our
final
hour
Let
me
be
the
voice
in
your
strength
and
your
choice
Let
me
simplify
the
rhyme
just
to
amplify
the
noise
Try
to
amplify
the
times
it,
and
multiply
by
six...
Teen
million
people,
Are
equal
at
this
high
pitch
Maybe
we
can
reach
alqueda
through
my
speech
Let
the
president
answer
a
higher
anarchy
Strap
him
with
an
Ak-47,
let
him
go,
fight
his
own
war
Let
him
impress
daddy
that
way
No
more
blood
for
oil,
we
got
our
own
battles
to
fight
on
our
own
soil
No
more
psychological
warfare,
to
trick
us
to
thinking
that
we
ain't
loyal
If
we
don't
serve
our
own
country,
we're
patronizing
a
hero
Look
in
his
eyes
its
all
lies
The
stars
and
stripes,
they've
been
swiped,
washed
out
and
wiped
And
replaced
with
his
own
face,
Mosh
now
or
die
If
I
get
sniped
tonight
you
know
why,
Cause
I
told
you
to
fight.
[Chorus]
And
as
we
proceed,
To
Mosh
through
this
desert
storm,
In
these
closing
statements,
if
they
should
argue
Let
us
beg
to
differ
As
we
set
aside
our
differences
And
assemble
our
own
army
To
disarm
this
Weapon
of
Mass
Destruction
That
we
call
our
President,
for
the
present
And
Mosh
for
the
future
of
our
next
generation
To
speak
and
be
heard
Mr.
President,
Mr.
Senator
Do
you
guy's
hear
us...hear
us...[laughing]
(Hailie)
[Sounds
of
someone
puking]
There
I
go--thinking
of
you
again
[Chorus]
You
don't
know
how
sick
you
make
me
You
make
me
fuckin'
sick
to
my
stomach
Every
time
I
think
of
you,
I
puke
You
must
just
not
know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You
may
not
think
you
do,
but
you
do
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
I
was
gonna
take
the
time
to
sit
down
and
write
you
a
little
poem
But
off
of
the
dome
would
probably
be
a
little
more,
more
suitable
for
this
type
of
song--whoa
I
got
a
million
reasons
off
the
top
of
my
head
that
I
could
think
of
Sixteen
bars,
this
ain't
enough
to
put
some
ink
ta
So
fuck
it,
I'ma
start
right
here
by
just
be
brief-a
Bout
to
rattle
off
some
other
reasons
I
knew
I
shouldn't
go
and
get
another
tattoo
of
you
On
my
arm,
but
what
do
I
go
and
do
I
go
and
get
another
one,
now
I
got
two
Ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
ooh
I'm
sittin'
here
with
your
name
on
my
skin
I
can't
believe
I
went
and
did
this
stupid
shit
again
My
next
girlfriend,
now
her
name's
gotta
be
Kim
Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it
If
you
only
knew
how
much
I
hated
you
For
every
motherfuckin'
thing
you
ever
put
us
through
Then
I
wouldn't
be
standing
here
crying
over
you
Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-who
[Chorus]
You
don't
know
how
sick
you
make
me
You
make
me
fuckin'
sick
to
my
stomach
Every
time
I
think
of
you,
I
puke
You
must
just
not
know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You
may
not
think
you
do,
but
you
do
Every
time
I
think
of
you
I
puke
I
was
gonna
take
the
time
to
sit
down
and
write
you
a
little
letter
But
I
thought
a
song
would
probably
be
a
little
better
Instead
of
a
letter
That
you'd
probably
just
shred
up--yeah
I
stumbled
on
your
picture
yesterday
and
it
made
me
stop
and
think
of
How
much
of
a
waste
it'd
be
for
me
to
put
some
ink
ta,
a
stupid
piece
a
Paper,
I'd
rather
let
you
see
how
Much
I
fuckin'
hate
you
in
a
freestyle
You're
a
fuckin'
coke-head
slut,
I
hope
you
fuckin'
die
I
hope
you
get
to
hell
and
Satan
sticks
a
needle
in
your
eye
I
hate
your
fuckin'
guts,
you
fuckin'
slut,
I
hope
you
die
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie
But
please
don't
get
me
wrong,
I'm
not
bitter
or
mad
It's
not
that
I
still
love
you,
it's
not
'cause
I
want
you
back
It's
just
that
when
I
think
of
you,
it
makes
me
wanna
gag-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag
What
else
can
I
do,
I
haven't
got
a
clue
Now
I
guess
I'll
just
move
on,
I
have
no
choice
but
to
But
every
time
I
think
of
you
now,
I'll
I
wanna
do
Is
pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke
[Chorus]
You
don't
know
how
sick
you
make
me
You
make
me
fuckin'
sick
to
my
stomach
Every
time
I
think
of
you,
I
puke
You
must
just
not
know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You
may
not
think
you
do,
but
you
do
Every
time
I
think
of
you,
I
puke
Fuckin'
bitch
Ohh!
Yeah!
So
much
for
first
single
on
this
one
[Verse
1]
Shady's
the
lable
Aftermath
is
the
stable
That
the
horses
come
out
of
errp
Of
course
we're
about
to
stir
up
Some
shit
thick
as
Mrs.
Butterworths
syrup
It's
the
mr.
picked
on
Christopher
Reeves
Just
for
no
reason
other
than
to
just
to
tease
him
Cause
he
was
his
biggest
fan.
He
used
to
be
Superman
Now
I`m
pourin
liquor
on
the
curb
in
his
name
for
him
Eminem
you
wait
till'
we
meet
up
again
Fucker
I'm
kicking
your
ass
for
everything
you've
ever
said
It
goes
one
for
the
money

for
the
fuckin
show
Ready
get
set,
let's
go
Here
comes
the
Buckin´
Bronco
stompin
and
stampedin
up
the
damn
street
Like

buffalo
soldiers,
I
told

I'm

to
blow
So
look
out
below,
geronimo,
motherfuckers
it´s
dominos
I'm
on
a
roll,
around
and
around
I
go
When
will
I
stop?
I
don't
know
Tryin´
to
pick
up
where
the
Eminem
Show
left
off
But
I
know
anything's
possible
Though
I'm
not
gonna
top
what
I
sold
I'm
at
the
top
of
my
game
That
shit
is
not
gonna
change
Long
as
I
got
Dr.
Dre
on
my
team
I'll
get
away
with
murder
I'm
like
O.J.
he's
like
my
Cochran
today
We
keep
them
Mark
Ferman
tapes
In
a
safe,
locked
Em´
away
Better
watch
what
you
say
Just
when
you
thought
you
were
safe
Them
fuckers
got
you
on
tape
You
swear
to
god
you
was
playin
Whether
or
not
you
was
little
Joshua
Gosh
I
wish
I
could
have
told
you
to
not
do
the
same
Cause
one
day
it
could
cost
you
your
name
[chorus]
And
this
was
supposed
to
be
my
first
single
But
I
just
fucked
that
off
so,
Fuck

let's
all
have
fun
let's

Slap

This

And

The
Source

Em´
Cause

could
have
sworn

Ni
And

tried
to

and

over
it
But

My

get
off
your
chest
And
address
it
about
my

I'd
love
to

All
you
gotta
do
is

up
the
phone
and
just
dial
up
this
number
It's
1-800
I'm
a
dick
sucker
I
love
to
suck
a
dick
And
if
someone
picks
up
you
can
talk
all
the
shit
you
want
about
me
Just
type
in
your
number
back
and
follow
it
by
the
pound
key
And
I'll
be
sure
to
get
back
As
soon
as
there

a
day

Dre
Wake
up

and
make
up
with
Ray
(Hey!)
So

Beat

big
cock,

a
big

Or
suck
a

and
lick
a

And

Hey,
what's
going
on,
this
is
Paul
Rosenberg,
attorney
of
law.
Listen,
I
listened
to
the
rough
copy
of
your
album
And
uh,
you
know
I've
just
got
to
be
honest
with
you
Can
you
tone
it
down
a
little
bit?
Because
there's
only
so
much
I
can
explain.
Give
me
a
call
[Dre
(Em)]
Yeah
(Definately,
definately,
definately,
definately
definately
K-mart)
Yeah,
yeah
[Eminem
(Dr.
Dre):]
You
find
me
offensive?
I
find
you
offensive
For
finding
me
offensive
Hence
if
I
should
draw
a
line
on
any
fences
If
so
to
what
extense
if
Any,
should
I
go?
'Cause
it's
getting
expensive
Being
on
the
other
side
of
the
courtroom
on
the
defensive
They
say
that
I
cause
extensive
Pshycological
nerve
damage
to
the
brain
when
I
go
to
lenghts
this,
Far
at
other
people's
expenses
I
say
your
all
just
too
god
damn
sensitive
It's
censorship
And
it's
down
right
blasphomous
Listen
to
shit
now
cause
I
won't
stand
for
this
And
Chirs-stiff-pher
Reeves
won't
sit
for
this
neither
And
let's
clear
this
up
too
I
ain't
got
no
beef
with
him
either
He
used
to
be
like
a
hero
to
me
I
even
believe
I,
had
one
of
those
25
cent
stickers
on
my
re--fridgerator
Right
next
to
Darth
Vader
And
Darth
must
have
put
a
hex
on
him
for
later
I
feel
like
it's
my
fault
cause
of
the
way
that
I
stuck
him
up
in
between
him
and
Lex
Luther
I
killed
Superman,
I
killed
Super--man
And
how
ironic,
that
I'd
be
the
bad
guy
Kryptonite:
The
Green
Chronic
[Chorus:]
Cause
I
ain't
got
no
legs!
Or
no
brain,
nice
to
meet
you
Hi,
my
name
is...
I
forgot
my
name!
My
name
was
not
to
become
what
I
became
with
this
level
of
fame
My
soul
is
possessed
by
this
devil
my
new
name
is....
Rain
Man
Now
in
the
Bible
it
says
Thou
shalt
not
watch
two
lesbians
in
bed,
Have
homosexual
sex
Unless
of
course
you
were
given
the
consent
to
join
in
Then
of
course,
it's
intercourse
And
it's
bi-sexual
sex
Which
isn't
as
bad,
as
long
as
you
show
some
remorse
for
your
actions
Either
before,
during
or
after
peforming
the
act
of
that
which
Is
normally
referred
to
have
such,
more
commonly
known
phrases
That
are
more
used
by
today's
kids
In
a
more
derogatory
way
but
Who's
to
say,
what's
fair
to
say,
and
what
not
to
say?
Let's
ask
Dr.
Dre
Dr.
Dre?
(What
up?)
I
gotta
question
if
I
may?
(Yeah)
Is
it
gay
to
play
Putt-Putt
golf
with
a
friend
(Yeah)
And
watch
his
butt-butt
when
he
tees
off?
(Yeah)
But,
ut!
I
ain't
done
yet
In
football
the
quarterback
yells
out
hutt-hutt
While
he
reaches
in
another
grown
man's
ass
Grabs
on
his
nuts
but
just
what
if
It
was
never
meant
it
was
just
an
accident
But
he
tripped,
fell,
slipped
and
his
penis
went
in
His
teeny
tiny
little
round
hiney
but
he
didn't
mean
it
But
his
little
weenie
flinched
just
a
little
bit
And
I
don't
mean
to
go
in
into
any
more
details
but
What
if
he
pictured
it
as
a
females
butt?
Is
that
gay?
I
just
need
to
clear
things
up
Til
then
i'll
just
walk
around
with
a
manly
strut
because...
[Chorus]
You
find
me
offensive,
I
find
you
offensive
Shit,
this
is
the
same
verse
I
just
did
this
When
am
I
gonna
come
to
my
good
senses?
Probably
the
day
Bush
comes
to
my
defenceses
My
spider
senses
telling
me
Spiderman
is
nearby
And
my
plan
is
to
get
him
next
And
open
up
a
whip
ass
canister
God
damn
it
Dre
where
is
the
god
damn
beat?
(Yeah)
Anyway,
anyway
I
don't
know
how
else
to
put
it
This
is
the
only
thing
that
I'm
good
at
I
am
the
bad
guy,
Kryptonite:
The
Green
Chronic
Demonic,
yep
yep,
don't
worry
I'm
on
it
I
got
it,
high
five
Nick
Lachey
Stuck
a
pen
in
Jessica's
head
and
walked
away
And
she
blew
around
the
room
like
a
balloon-a
Grabbed
the
last
can
of
chicken
tuna
Out
the
trash
can
and
screw
my
Head
is
straight
back
to
the
Neverland
Ranch
With
a
peanut
butter,
jelly,
chicken,
tuna
sandwhich
And
I
don't
gotta
make
no
god
damn
sense
I
just
did
a
whole
song
and
I
didn't
say
shit
[Chorus]
Cause
IIIAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAAA
AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH
Yo,
Rain
Man
Definately,
definately
Dr.
Dre
super
dope
beat
maker
two
thousand
and
Two
thousand
four
hundred
and
eighty
seven
million
Nine
hundred
and
n
seventy
three
thousand
four
hundred
and
sixty
three
And
seventy
(Yeah)
I
don't
understand
Why
are
you
being
so
mean?
You're
mean
mean
man
[Chorus]
You
are
just
jealous
of
me
Cuz
you,
you
just
can't
do
what
I
do
So
instead
of
just
admitting
it
You
walk
around
and
say
All
kinds
of
really
mean
things
About
me
cuz
you're
a
meanie,
a
meanie
But
it's
only
cuz
you're
Just
really
jealous
of
me
Cuz
I'm
what
you
want
to
be
So
you
just
look
like
an
idiot
When
you
say
these
mean
things
Cuz
it's
too
easy
to
see
You're
just
a
really
big
weenie,
big
weenie
[Verse
1]
Alright
listen,
I
need
you
to
focus
I
need
you
to
go
dig
deep
in
your
mind,
this
is
important
We
are
going
to
perform
an
experiment
of
the
sorts
I'm
going
to
have
to
ask
you
to
bear
with
me
for
a
moment
Now
I
need
you
to
open
your
mind-your
eyes
close
them
You
are
now
about
to
be
placed
under
my
hypnosis
For
the
next
four
and
a
half
minutes
We
are
going
to
explore
into
your
mind
To
find
out
why
you're
so
fuckin'
jealous
Now
why
did
they
make
Yoo-Hoo?
Hippity
ga-ga
boo-boo
Psych,
I'm
kidding
I
just
wanted
to
see
if
you're
still
listenin'
Ok,
now
I
need
your
undivided
attention
Sir
I
have
a
question
Why
do
I
always
sense
this
undeniable
tension
From
the
moment
that
I
enter
into
the
room
It
gets
all
quiet
and
whispers
Whenever
theres
conversation,
why
am
I
always
mentioned?
I've
been
dying
to
ask,
it's
been
itchin'
at
me
Is
it
just
because
[Chorus]
[Verse
2]
Alright
now
I,
I
just
flubbed
a
line
I
was
going
to
say
something
extremely
important
But
I
forgot
who
or
what
it
was,
I
fucked
up
Psych,
I'm
kidding
again
you
idiot,
no
I
didn't
That's
just
what
you
wanted
to
hear
from
me
Is
that
I
fucked
up
ain't
it?
But
I
can
bust
one
take
without
lookin'
at
no
paper
It
doesn't
take
a
bunch
of
takes
Or
me
to
stand
here
in
this
booth
all
day
For
me
to
say
the
truth,
ok?
You're
droolin,
you
have
tooth
decay
Your
mouth
is
open,
you're
disgusting
What
the
fuck
you
eat
for
lunch
A
bunch
of
sweets
or
something,
what?
You
munch
a
bunch
of
Crunch
'N
Munch?
Your
tooth
is
rotten
to
the
gum
Your
breath
stinks,
wanna
chew
some
gum?
Yes
I
do
sir,
what
am
I
on?
You
sir
are
on
chew
syrum
Marshall
I'm
so
jealous
of
you
Please
say
you
won't
tell
nobody
I'd
be
so
embarrassed,
I'm
just
absolutely
terrified
That
someone's
gonna
find
out
why
I'm
saying
All
these
terrible,
evil
and
awful
mean
things
It's
my
own
insecurity!
[Chorus]
[Verse
3]
Alright
now
we,
we're
going
to
conduct
That
experiment
that
we
were
talking
about
earlier
Just
to
see
what
a
frog
looks
like
when
it
takes
two
hits
of
ecstasy
Cuz
that's
exactly
what
your
eyes
look
like,
want
to
check
to
see?
Here's
a
mirror,
notice
the
resemblence
here?
Wait,
let
me
put
these
sun
glasses
on
Now
look
in
this
mirror,
how
about
now?
What
do
you
have
in
common?
You're
both
green
with
envy
and
look
like
idiots
with
sunglasses
on
'em
You
look
like
I
sound
like
singing
about
weenies
Now
take
my
weenie
out
of
your
mouth
This
is
between
me
and
you,
I
know
you're
not
happy
I
know
you'd
much
rather
see
me
lying
in
the
corner
of
a
room
somewhere
crying
Curled
up
in
a
ball
tweeked
out
of
my
mind
dying
There
is
no
denying
that
my
weenie
is
much
bigger
than
yours
is
Mine
is
like
sticking
a
banana
between
two
oranges
Why
you
even
doing
this
to
yourself,
it's
pointless
Why
do
we
have
to
keep
on
going
through
this,
this
is
tortuous
My
point
is
this
That
if
you
say
mean
things,
weenie
will
shrink
Now
I
fogot
what
the
chorus
is,
your
just
is...
[Chorus]
Eminem
-
Em
Calls
Paul
(Skit)
Encore
Aye
yo
Paul,
It's
Em
I
got
your
call
about
the
Michael
Jackson
thing
And
I
know
that
he's
not
'thrilled'
about
the
video
What
does
he
'wanna
be
startin'
somethin'?'
Well
I'll
show
him
who's
really
'bad'
Paul,
'the
way
you
make
me
feel'
with
these
calls
You
should
really
take
a
look
at
the
'man
in
the
mirror'
And
tell
him
to
'beat
it'
because
I
'won't
stop
till
I
get
enough'
Do
you
'remember
the
time'
we
were
watching
the
'Billy
Jean'
video?
Well
he'll
always
be
that
Michael
to
me
And
it
doesn't
matter
if
he's
'black
or
white'
Because
I
'can't
stop
loving
him'
and
I
hate
plastic
surgeons
And
I
hope
they
all
fucking
die!
How
do
you
like
that?
And
I
like
him,
I
like
him
a
lot
I
want
to
touch
him
but
I
can't
Excuse
me,
I'm
taking
a
shit
Sorry
Anyways,
call
me
back
I
have
this
idea
about
how
I
want
to
end
the
show
So,
hit
me
when
you
get
this
message
fucker
Oh,
and
by
the
way
No
I
don't
have
a
new
gun
[click]
(goddamn
it)
Down
down
down
Down
down
down
Down
down
down
Down
okay
Guess
who's
back,
back
again
Shady's
back,
tell
a
friend
Now
everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
To
the
dance
floor,
to
the
dance
floor
Now
everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
Alright,
stop
pajama
time
Come
here,
little
kiddies!
On
my
lap!
Guess
who's
back
with
a
brand
new
rap?
And
I
don't
mean
"rap"
as
in
a
new
case
Of
child
molestation
accusations
Ah
ah
ah
ah
ah,
no
worries
Papa's
got
a
brand
new
bag
of
toys
What
else
could
I
possibly
do
to
make
noise?
I've
done
touched
on
everything
but
little
boys
That's
not
a
stab
at
Michael
That's
just
a
metaphor,
I'm
just
psycho
I
go
a
little
bit
crazy
sometimes
I
get
a
little
bit
out
of
control
with
my
rhymes
Good
God,
dip,
do
a
little
slide
Bend
down,
touch
your
toes,
and
just
glide
To
the
center
of
the
dance
floor
Like
TP
for
my
bung-hole
And
it's
cool
if
you
let
one
go
Nobody's
gonna
know,
who'd
hear
it?
Give
a
little
"poot
poot,"
it's
okay
*fart
sound*
Oops,
my
CD
just
skipped
And
everyone
just
heard
you
let
one
rip
Now
I'm
gonna
make
you
dance
It's
your
chance,
yeah
boy,
shake
that
ass
Whoops,
I
mean
girl
girl,

Girl,

Alright,

It's
Friday
and
it's
my
day
Just
to
party
all
the
way
to
Sunday
Maybe
'til
Monday,
I
don't
know
what
day
Everyday's
just
a
holiday
Cruisin'
on
the
freeway,
feelin'
kind
of
breezy
Let
the
top
down
and
my
hair
blow
I
don't
know
where
I'm
goin',
all
I
know
is
When
I
get
there
someone's
gonna
(touch
my
body)
Excuse
me,
miss,
I
don't
mean
to
sound
like
a
jerk
But
I'm
feelin'
just
a
little
stressed
out
from
work
Would
you
punch
me
in
the
stomach
and
pull
my
hair
Spit
on
me,
maybe
gouge
my
eyes
out?
(Yeah)
Now,
what's
your
name,
girl?
What's
your
sign?
(Man,
you
must
be
up
out
your
mind)
Dre
(ah
ah)
beer
goggles,
blind
I'm
just
tryin'
to
unwind,

It's
Tuesday
and
I'm
locked
up
I'm
in
jail
and
I
don't
know
what
happened
They
say
I
was
runnin'
butt
naked
Down
the
street
screamin'
(ah
ah
ah
ah)
Your
honor,
I'm
sorry,
I
don't
remember
All
I
know
is
this
much,
I'm
not
guilty
They
said
"Save
it,
boy,
we
got
you
on
tape
Yellin'
at
an
old
lady"
(Touch
my
body!)
Now
this
is
the
part
where
the
rap
breaks
down
It
gets
real
intense,
no
one
makes
a
sound
Everything
looks
like
it's
8
Mile
now
The
beat
comes
back
and
everybody
lose
themselves
Now
snap
back
to
reality;
look,
there's
B.
Rabbit!
"Oh,
you
signed
me
up
to
battle?
I'm
a
grown
man!"
Chuba

Tall

Everyone

(ha!)
[Eminem]
If
there's
any
bitches
in
this
room,
then
there's
something
I
gotta
say
For
all
the
fools
who
fell
for
the
first
girl
who
comes
their
way
I've
been
down
that
road
and
now
I'm
back,
sittin'
on
square
one
Tryna
pick
myself
up
where
I
started
from
[Obie
Trice]
I
never
woulda
thought
that
I'd
see
you
outta
control
Even
though
my
penis
was
deep
down
in
your
hole
You
should
know
between
us
we
was
like
mates
to
soul
Nothing
could
intervene
us,
especially
no
hoes
You
was
more
or
so
the
chalant
type,
I
chose
To
more
shows,
haunted
you
nights
I
suppose
That's
how
it
go,
with
time
spent,
emotion
grows
In
the
beginning,
friends
we
decided
to
roll
So
who's
responsible
when
you
get
excited,
explode
And
Obie's
grinning,
then
you
invite
that
Obie's
cold
But
bitches
the
gon'
talk,
niggas
they
gon'
hate
We
established
this
way
before
we
became
mates
So
whats
required
is
that
you
chill
with
all
that
fire
Get
your
desire
when
I
retire
[Chorus]
Spend
some
time
with
me,
say
that
you'll
be
mine
I
never
thought
I'd
find
someone
to
be
mine
Lord
knows
I
was
right
cuz
you
just
crossed
the
line
Spend
some
time
with
me,
say
that
you'll
be
mine
[Eminem]
I
used
to
say
I
never
met
a
girl
like
you
before
Still
ain't
got
a
fuckin'
clue
as
to
who
you
truly
are
Almost
went
as
far
as
introducing
you
to
my
daughters
Till
you
went
as
far
as
goin'
and
snoopin'
through
my
drawers
Now
I
just
feel
stupid
for
the
loop
that
you
threw
me
for
Can't
believe
I
almost
flew
the
coop
for
some
stupid
whore
You
used
to
say
all
you
wanted
was
for
me
to
be
yours
All
I
ever
wanted
from
you
was
a
few
booty
calls
If
you
recall
I
used
to
treat
you
as
a
groupie
broad
When
we
fucked
I
refused
to
even
take
my
jewelry
off
But
it
threw
me
off
the
first
time
I
called
and
you
blew
me
off
It
was
a
shock,
it
struck
me
as
odd
but
it
turned
me
on
You
started
getting
moody
on
me,
pretty
soon
we'd
argue
And
the
ruder
you
got,
the
more
beautiful
you
got
to
me
And
who
woulda
even
knew
that
who
woulda
even
thought
possibly
Cupid
could
shoot
another
one
of
them
God
damn
darts
at
me
It's
true
that
I
got
shot
in
the
heart
But
when
someone
seems
too
good
to
be
true,
they
usually
are
But
see,
when
you're
in
it
it's
too
hard
to
see
Till
you
pull
up
and
see
some
other
dude's
car
parked
and
reach
Up
under
the
seat
as
your
heart
starts
to
beat
Before
you
make
a
decision
that's
life
altering
And
just
as
you
halt
and
you
turn
and
you
start
to
leave
You
hear
them
words
echoing,
almost
haunting,
that
taunting
ring
[Chorus]
[Stat
Quo]
In
most
cases,
Stat's
attitude
is
fuck-a-bitch
My
only
motive
is
to
get
head
and
fuck
a
bitch
But
you
was
different,
thought
we
shared
a
covenant
Even
held
your
hand
in
public,
we
sufferin'
because
of
this
Shorty
on
some
whole
'notha
other
shit
Tryna
play
sick
thinkin'
i'mma
trick
off
rick
I'll
admit,
I
was
caught
in
the
mix,
down
to
commit
Feed
you
the
best
of
me,
I
shoulda
fed
you
piss
We
started
off
closer
than
close
But
who
coulda
predicted
to
know,
your
triflin'
ways
woulda
stopped
our
growth
And
the
final
result,
back
in
that
same
boat
I
ask
myself,
do
I
love
these
hoes?
NO!
[50
cent]
Em
introduced
us,
"50
this
is
Tanya,
Tanya
this
is
50"
Then
slid
off
and
left
her
to
kick
it
with
me
I
complimented
her,
I
said
you
have
very
nice
lips
With
my
imagination,
I
could
see
her
suckin'
my
dick
We
played
the
phone
game,
a
week
later,
shit
changed
fast
Had
her
comin'
over
in
a
cab
to
give
me
some
ass
Downtown
Manhattan
on
the
balcony,
stare
at
the
skyline
Penthouse
full
of
imported
shit,
you
know
how
I
grind
She
got
to
talkin',
talkin'
like
an
opportunist
too
Why
talk
when
suckin'
my
dick
is
the
real
career
move?
Said
she's
an
inspiring
actress,
she
do
videos
for
practice
Yeah,
yeah,
know
how
many
times
had
I
heard
that
shit?
[Chorus]
Yeah
I
know
sometimes
things
may
not
always
make
sense
to
you
right
now
But
hey,
what
daddy
always
tell
you?
Straighten
up
little
soldier
Stiffen
up
that
upper
lip
What
you
crying
about?
You
got
me
Hailie
I
know
you
miss
your
mom
and
I
know
you
miss
your
dad
When
I'm
gone
but
I'm
trying
to
give
you
the
life
that
I
never
had
I
can
see
you're
sad,
even
when
you
smile,
even
when
you
laugh
I
can
see
it
in
your
eyes,
deep
inside
you
want
to
cry
Cuz
you're
scared,
I
ain't
there?
Daddy's
with
you
in
your
prayers
No
more
crying,
wipe
them
tears
Daddy's
here,
no
more
nightmares
We
gon'
pull
together
through
it,
we
gon'
do
it
Laney
uncles
crazy,
aint
he?
Yeah
but
he
loves
you
girl
and
you
better
know
it
We're
all
we
got
in
this
world
When
it
spins,
when
it
swirls
When
it
whirls,
when
it
twirls
Two
little
beautiful
girls
Lookin'
puzzled,
in
a
daze
I
know
it's
confusing
you
Daddy's
always
on
the
move,
mamma's
always
on
the
news
I
try
to
keep
you
sheltered
from
it
but
somehow
it
seems
The
harder
that
I
try
to
do
that,
the
more
it
backfires
on
me
All
the
things
growing
up
his
daddy
that
he
had
to
see
Daddy
don't
want
you
to
see
but
you
see
just
as
much
as
he
did
We
did
not
plan
it
to
be
this
way,
your
mother
and
me
But
things
have
gotten
so
bad
between
us
I
don't
see
us
ever
being
together
ever
again
Like
we
used
to
be
when
we
was
teenagers
But
then
of
course
everything
always
happens
for
a
reason
I
guess
it
was
never
meant
to
be
But
it's
just
something
we
have
no
control
over
and
that's
what
destiny
is
But
no
more
worries,
rest
your
head
and
go
to
sleep
Maybe
one
day
we'll
wake
up
and
this
will
all
just
be
a
dream
Now
hush
little
baby,
don't
you
cry
Everything's
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up
little
lady,
I
told
ya
Daddy's
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
mommy's
not
here
right
now
and
we
don't
know
why
We
feel
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy,
pretty
baby
But
I
promise
momma's
gon'
be
alright
It's
funny
I
remember
back
one
year
when
daddy
had
no
money
Mommy
wrapped
the
Christmas
presents
up
And
stuck
'em
under
the
tree
and
said
some
of
'em
were
from
me
Cuz
daddy
couldn't
buy
'em
I'll
never
forget
that
Christmas
I
sat
up
the
whole
night
crying
Cuz
daddy
felt
like
a
bum,
see
daddy
had
a
job
But
his
job
was
to
keep
the
food
on
the
table
for
you
and
mom
And
at
the
time
every
house
that
we
lived
in
Either
kept
getting
broken
into
and
robbed
Or
shot
up
on
the
block
and
your
mom
was
saving
money
for
you
in
a
jar
Tryna
start
a
piggy
bank
for
you
so
you
could
go
to
college
Almost
had
a
thousand
dollars
till
someone
broke
in
and
stole
it
And
I
know
it
hurt
so
bad
it
broke
your
momma's
heart
And
it
seemed
like
everything
was
just
startin'
to
fall
apart
Mom
and
dad
was
arguin'
a
lot
so
momma
moved
back
On
the
Chalmers
in
the
flat
one
bedroom
apartment
And
dad
moved
back
to
the
other
side
of
8
Mile
on
Novara
And
that's
when
daddy
went
to
California
with
his
CD
and
met
Dr.
Dre
And
flew
you
and
momma
out
to
see
me
But
daddy
had
to
work,
you
and
momma
had
to
leave
me
Then
you
started
seeing
daddy
on
the
T.V.
and
momma
didn't
like
it
And
you
and
Laney
were
to
young
to
understand
it
Papa
was
a
rollin'
stone,
momma
developed
a
habit
And
it
all
happened
too
fast
for
either
one
of
us
to
grab
it
I'm
just
sorry
you
were
there
and
had
to
witness
it
first
hand
Cuz
all
I
ever
wanted
to
do
was
just
make
you
proud
Now
I'm
sittin
in
this
empty
house,
just
reminiscing
Lookin'
at
your
baby
pictures,
it
just
trips
me
out
To
see
how
much
you
both
have
grown,
it's
almost
like
you're
sisters
now
Wow,
guess
you
pretty
much
are
and
daddy's
still
here
Laney
I'm
talkin'
to
you
too,
daddy's
still
here
I
like
the
sound
of
that,
yeah
It's
got
a
ring
to
it
don't
it?
Shh,
momma's
only
gone
for
the
moment
Now
hush
little
baby,
don't
you
cry
Everything's
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up
little
lady,
I
told
ya
Daddy's
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
mommy's
not
here
right
now
and
we
don't
know
why
We
feel
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy,
pretty
baby
But
I
promise
momma's
gon'
be
alright
And
if
you
ask
me
too
Daddy's
gonna
buy
you
a
mockingbird
I'mma
give
you
the
world
I'mma
buy
a
diamond
ring
for
you
I'mma
sing
for
you
I'll
do
anything
for
you
to
see
you
smile
And
if
that
mockingbird
don't
sing
and
that
ring
don't
shine
I'mma
break
that
birdies
neck
I'd
go
back
to
the
jewler
who
sold
it
to
ya
And
make
him
eat
every
carat
don't
fuck
with
dad
(haha)
[Ann
Wilson's
voice]
I
Tell
myself
that
I'm
doing
alright
Nothing
else
to
do
tonight
but
To
go
Crazy,
Crazy
On
You
Lemme
go
Crazy,
Crazy
on
you
youuuuuuuuu
[Verse
1]
Can't
you
see
what
you
do
to
me
baby?
You
make
me
crazy,
you
make
me
act
like
a
maniac.
I'm
like
a
lunatic,
you
make
me
sick
You
truly
are
the
only
one
who
can
do
this
to
me
You
just
make
me
get
so
crazy.
I
go
skitzo,
I
get
so
insane
I
just
go
skitzophrenic
One
minute
I
want
to
slit
your
throat
The
next
I
want
sex.
You
make
me
crazy,
the
way
we
act
like
2
maniacs
in
the
sac
We
fuck
like
2
jackrabbits
And
maybe
that's
a
bad
habit.
Cuz
the
next
day
we're
right
back
at
it
In
the
same
exact
pattern
What
the
fuck
is
the
matter
with
us
We
can't
figure
out
if
it's
Lust
or
it's
love
What's
sad
is
what's
attracting
us
to
each
other
They
say
that
every
man
grows
up
to
marry
his
own
mother.
Which
would
explain
why
you're
such
a
motherfucking
bitch
But
I
stay
and
still
stick
it
out
with
you
even
though
I
just
hit
you
today
But
you
deserve
it
you
hit
me
first
and
provoked
me
to
choke
you
Just
cuz
I
came
home
late
last
night
crawled
in
bed
and
I
woke
you.
But
if
there's
one
thing
about
you
I
admire
its,
baby,
Because
you
stay
with
me,
maybe,
because
you're
as
crazy
as
I
am
Cuz
when
I
look
at
you
I
can
see
an
angel
in
your
eyes
But
if
I
look
deeper
inside
I
see
your
freakish
little
side.
Like
a
devil
in
disguise,
You're
always
full
of
surprises
Always
pullin'
devises
Out
your
personal
vibrators
and
dildos
You
fucked
yourself
so
much
You
barely
feel
those
anymore
You're
only
24
but
you're
plenty
more
mature
Than
those
other
little
hoes
Who
just
act
like
little
girls
Like
they're
in
middle
school
still
You're
crazy
sexy
cool,
chillin
You
play
your
position
You
never
step
out
of
line
Even
though
I
stay
in
your
business
You've
always
kept
out
of
mine.
I
wonder
whats
on
your
mind
Sometimes
they
say
love
is
blind
Maybe
that's
why
the
first
time
I
dotted
your
eye
You
ain't
see
a
sign.
[with
Chorus]
Or
maybe
you
did
Maybe
you
like
being
shoved
Maybe
cuz
we're
crazy
in
loooove
[Chorus]
Crazy
on
you
Crazy
on
you
Let
me
go
crazy
crazy
on
youuuuuuuuu
[Verse
2]
You're
the
ink
to
my
paper
Where
my
pen
is
to
my
pad
The
moral,
the
very
fiber
The
whole
substance
to
my
rap.
You
are
my
reason
for
being
The
meaning
of
my
existence
If
it
wasn't
for
you
I
would
never
be
able
to
spit
this
As
intence
I
do
and
the
irony
Is
you
rely
on
me
as
much
as
I
rely
on
you
to
inspire
me
like
you
do.
You
provide
me
the
lighter
fluid
to
fuel
my
fire
You're
my
entire
supply
Gas,
the
match,
the
igniter.
The
only
way
that
I
am
able
to
stay
so
stable
Is
you're
the
legs
to
my
table
If
you
were
to
break
I'd
fall
on
my
face.
But
I'm
always
going
to
make
you
feel
I
don't
need
you
as
much
as
I
really
need
you
So
you
don't
use
it
to
your
advantage.
But
you're
essential
to
me
You're
the
air
I
breathe
I
believe
if
you
ever
leave
me
I'd
probably
have
no
reason
to
be.
You
are
the
Kim
to
my
Marshall
You're
the
Slim
to
my
Shady
The
Dre
to
my
Eminem
The
Elaina
to
my
Hailey.
You
are
the
word
I
am
looking
for
when
I'm
trying
to
describe
how
I
feel
inside
And
the
right
one
just
won't
come
to
my
mind.
You're
like
the
pillar
that
props
me
up
The
beam
that
supports
me
The
bitch
who
never
took
half,
The
wife
who
never
divorced
me.
You're
like
the
root
to
my
evil
You
let
my
devil
come
out
me
You
let
me
beat
the
shit
out
you
Before
you
beat
the
shit
out
me.
[with
Chorus]
And
no
matter
how
much
Too
much
is
never
enough
Maybe
cuz
we're
crazy
in
loooove
[Chorus]
I'm
crazy
on
you
Crazy
on
you
Let
me
go
crazy
crazy
on
youuuuuuuuu
(feat.
D12)

Sleepin

Still
tryna
get
inside
the
club
to
see
D12
perform
The

the

too
small
People
are
wall

three
thousand
and
some
odd
vans
And
some
cum
wad
from
out
the
parkin
lot
Get
into
an
argument
over
a
parkin
spot
He
decides
to
pull
his
gun
out
and
let's
a
few
of
'em
off
Missed
who
he's
aimin
for
six
feet
away's
the
door
In
St.
Andrew's
hall
not
a
stray
slidin
all
over
the
place
Sprays
one
bitch
in
the
face
another
one
of
'em
came
through
the
wall
Before
anyone
could
even
hear
the
first
shot
go
off
I'm
posted
up
by
the
bar
havin
a
Mozeltoff
Bullet
wizzed
right
by
my
ear
damn
near
shot
it
off
Thank
god
I'm
alive
I
gotta
find
Denaun
And
where
the
fuck
is
Von
he
usually
tucks
one
on
him
Wait
a
minute
I
think
I
just
saw
Bizarre
Nah
I
guess
not,
what
the
fuck
oh
my
god
it
was
I
never
saw
him
run
so
fast
in
my
life
Look
at
him
haulin
ass
I
think
he
left
his
wife
There
she
is
on
the
ground
bein
trampled
I
go
to
grab
her
up
by
the
damn
hand
and
I
can't
pull
her
God
damn
there
just
went
another
damn
bullet
I'm
hit
My
vest
is
barely
able
to
handle
it,
its
to
thin
If
I
get
hit
again
I
can't
do
it,
I
scoop
Dee
Follow
Bizarre's
path
and
ran
through
it
And
made
it
to
the
front
door
and
collapsed
on
the
steps
Looked
up
and
I
seen
Swift
shootin
it
out
But
I
can't
see
who
he's
shootin
it
out
with
But
Denaun's
right
behind
him
squeezin
his
four
fifth
[Chorus-
Eminem]
One
shot
two
shot
three
shots
four
shots
All
I
hear

gunshots
this
is
where
the
fun
stops
Bodies

hit
the
floor
music's
off
Parties
stop,
everybody
hit
the
door
someone's
lickin
shots
off

It's

Big

I

Although
I
can't
stay
here
to
fight
cuz
I'm
poppin

Thats
right
bitches
I'm
drunk
with
revenge
Shot

bouncer
in
the
neck
for
tryna
check
when
I
get
in
Swift
told
me
to
meet
him
here
so
its
clear
that
this
fucka
Shoot
out
the
back
of
his
truck
goes
up
in
this
mothafucka
So
one
shot
for
the
money
two's
to
stop
the
show
Third's
for
the
bartender
there's
plenty
of
shots
to

He

Proof

[Chorus-
Eminem]
One

All

[Eminem
singing]
There's
an
intruder
in
my
house
He
cut
my
phone-lines
can't
dial
out
I
scream
for
police
but
I
doubt
They're
gonna
hear
me
when
I
shout
[rapping]
A
couple
of
cocktails
will
send
me
to
jail
there's
a
couple
of
cops
hot
on
my
trail
But
this
time,
when
I
get
pulled
over
there's
a
doberman
pinscher
and
a
pitbull
in
the

these
pigs
'll

fooling

Bitch,

No

always
gotta
be
an
issue
when
you're

and
which
you're
gonna
see
in
the
long
run
Im'a

Fuck

I
don't

I'd

It's

but
I
said
precedents
and
the
standards
and
they
can't
stand
it
My
name
should've
been
bastard
the
shit
should've
been
plastered

with
a

I
should've
been
blasted
I
should've
been
had
a
cap
pulled

but
I'm
too

I'm

[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
[verse
1]
It's
sick
but
who
could
ever
predict
we'd
be
doin'
the
same
shit
We
say
that
we
do
it
for
our
baby
but
we
don't,
we
do
it
for
us
It's
lust,
'cuz
neither
one
of
us
trusts
each
other
so
we
fuck
'till
we
bust,
'till
cuss
each
other
out,
we
know
what
it's
about
Shout
'till
I
throw
you
out
the
house,
you
throw
me
out
the
house
I
throw
you
on
the
couch,
punch
you
in
the
mouth,
we
fist
fight
'till
we
turn
this
mother
out
and
apologize
after,
laughter
Pain,
it's
insane,
we're
back
in
the
same
chapter
again
And
it's
sad
but
it's
true,
when
i'm
laying
here
with
you
There
ain't
nothing
anyone
could
ever
say
or
ever
do
'cuz
[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
[verse
2]
'Cuz
I
hate
you,
do
you
hate
me?
Good,
'cuz
you're
so
fuckin
beautiful
when
you're
angry
It
makes
me
wanna
just
take
you
and
just
throw
you
on
the
bed
and
fuck
you
like
I
don't
even
know
you
You
FUCK
other
people
and
I
FUCK
other
people
You're
a
SLUT,
but
i'm
equal,
i'm
a
MUTT,
we're
both
evilin
our
ways
but
neither
one
of
us
would
ever
admit
it
'Cuz
one
of
us
would
have
one
up
on
the
other
so
forget
it
We
can
make
accusations,
people
spread
rumours
But
they
ain't
got
proof,
'till
they
do,
it's
just
the
two
of
us
You
and
me,
'cuz
any
chick
can
say
that
she's
screwin'
me
But
you
gotta
believe
it
to
a
degree
'cuz
true
indeed
If
you
didn't
I
wouldn't
be
hittin',
yeah
I
would
'Cuz
the
sex
is
too
damn
good,
if
I
ran,
who
would
I
run
to
that
would
be
this
soft
and
warm?
So
it's
off
and
on
Usually
more
off
then
on
but
at
least
we
know
that
we
Share
this
common
bond,
you're
the
only
one
I
can
fuck
without
a
condom
on,
I
hope
the
only
reason
that
I
cope
Is
'cuz
of
that
fact
and
I
can
bust
in
that,
and
that's
why
[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
[verse
3]
I
can
never
understand
it,
that's
why
I
don't
try
From
junior
high
until
we
both
die,
you
silly
hoe
why
must
we
try
Is
it
really
so
rough
that
we
must
always
call
each
other's
Billy
Goat's
Gruff
Try
to
pull
each
other's
legs
until
the
other
begs
We're
lying
to
ourself,
that's
the
beauty
of
it,
yeah
'Cuz
we
truly
love
each
other,
that's
why
we
always
fight
And
all
we
do
is
shove
each
other
every
other
fuckin'
night
And
it's
clear,
it
ain't
gonna
change,
this
pinned
up
rage
We
both
have,
we
both
feel
like
we've
been
upstaged
By
someone
else,
we
both
been
someone
else's
someone
else
The
problem
is
neither
one
wants
help,
it's
an
addiction
And
it
can't
be
fixed,
our
family's
mixed
up
There's
a
baby
sister
in
the
mix
and
it
hurts
'cuz
the
pieces
to
the
puzzle
don't
fit
And
anybody
who
thinks
he
knows
us
doesn't
know
shit
And
they're
probably
just
tired
of
hearing
it
all
the
time
on
every
song
Every
lyric
and
every
rhyme,
all
the
hoopla,
all
of
the
woopty
woo
What
you
put
me
through,
fuckin'
woopty
do
But
I
won't
be
made
a
fool
of,
if
this
is
true
love
You
wouldn't
do
what
you
did
last
time,
you
wouldn't
screw
up
This
time,
'cuz
this
time
girl
i'm
tellin
you
what
You
do
it
again
and
i'm
fuckin'
you
up
'cuz
no
matter
[chorus
2]
What
you
say,
what
you
do
I'ma
hunt
you
down
'till
I
find
you
No
matter
where
you
run,
i'll
be
right
there
Right
behind
you
in
your
nightmares
So
much
for
them
flowers,
and
the
candy
All
the
times
that
you
threw
it
back
at
me
Told
me
you
hate
me,
you
'gon
hate
me
more
When
you
find
out
you
can't
escape
me,
whore
[chorus]
The
more
you
put
me
through
The
more
it
makes
me
wanna
come
back
to
you
You
say
you
hate
me,
I
just
love
you
more
You
don't
want
me,
I
just
want
you
more
I
buy
you
flowers,
you
throw
'em
at
me
I
know
it's
sad
but
it's
making
me
happy
The
more
that
you
slap
me,
the
more
that
it
turns
me
on
Because
you
love
me
and
I
love
you
more
Once
you
call
my
name
out
things
will
never
be
the
same....
They
should
have
never
let
us
get
off
foot
in
this
game...
Ever
since
I
was
introduced
to
rap
music
I
been
missin
a
screw
like
Bishop
and
Juice
I
could
lose
it
at
any
moment
Those
who
know
me
know
it
So
they
probaly
told
you
go
with
the
flow
Just
so
that
I
don't
explode
And
have
another
episode
where
I
let
it
go
as
far
as
The
one
with
Benzino
did
I'm
waitin
for
that
next
beef,
I'm
cocked,
locked
and
loaded
I'm
ready
to
go
so
bad
I'm
goin
bananas,
My
dick's
so
hard
Anna
Nicole
could
use
it
to
fuckin
pole
vault
with
Oh
shit,
I
mean
when
she
was
still
bloated
Before
they
cut
her
stomach
open
and
lipoed
it
Anybody
I
throw
flames
at
gets
a
name
it's
a
game
Cause
they
know
that
they
don't
spit
the
same
It's
a
shame,
what
people
do
for
10
minutes
of
fame
Everyday
it's
the
same
thing,
People
in
this
game
try
to
buddy
buddy
us
Just
to
get
close
enough
to
study
us
Everybody
just
wants
to
have
somethin
to
do
with
that
They
all
tryin
to
get
that
stamp
They
after
that
Shady
-
Aftermath
money
It's
like
a
monopoly
They
probaly
just
now
finally
understand
how
to
rob
fully
50
Cent
was
like
a
fuckin
jackpot
for
me
And
Dre,
it's
like
we
hit
the
fuckin
lottery
And
a
damn
slot
machine
at
the
same
time
as
eachother
Why
the
fuck
you
think
we
ride
like
we
brothers
When
we
rhyme
with
eachother
In
time
we
discovered
that
we
have
more
in
common
Then
we
thought
with
eachother
Both
robbed
of
our
mothers
Our
fathers
ain't
want
us
What
was
wrong
with
us,
was
it
our
fault
Cause
we
started
thinkin
god
doesn't
love
us
Two
odd
motheruckers
who
just
happened
to
meet
at
the
right
time
What
a
coincidence
cause
when
50
got
shot
up
in
Jamaica
Queens
I
still
remember
the
call
up
in
??
Big
L
had
just
got
popped
just
a
month
before
If
50
lives
he's
gettin
dropped
from
Columbia
Two
years
later
me
and
Doc
had
to
come
and
operate
That's
when
he
popped
up
a

[Eminem]
Whatever..
Dre,
just
let
it
run
Aiyyo
turn
the
beat
up
a
little
bit
Aiyyo..
this
song
is
for
anyone..
fuck
it
Just
shut
up
and
listen,
aiyyo..
I
sit
back
with
this
pack
of
Zig
Zags
and
this
bag
of
this
weed
it
gives
me
the
shit
needed
to
be
the
most
meanest
MC
on
this
--
on
this
Earth
And
since
birth
I've
been
cursed
with
this
curse
to
just
curse
And
just
blurt
this
berserk
and
bizarre
shit
that
works
And
it
sells
and
it
helps
in
itself
to
relieve
all
this
tension
dispensin
these
sentences
Gettin
this
stress
that's
been
eatin
me
recently
off
of
this
chest
and
I
rest
again
peacefully
(peacefully)..
but
at
least
have
the
decency
in
you
to
leave
me
alone,
when
you
freaks
see
me
out
in
the
streets
when
I'm
eatin
or
feedin
my
daughter
to
not
come
and
speak
to
me
(speak
to
me)..
I
don't
know
you
and
no,
I
don't
owe
you
a
mo-therfuck-in
thing
I'm
not
Mr.
N'Sync,
I'm
not
what
your
friends
think
I'm
not
Mr.
Friendly,
I
can
be
a
prick
if
you
tempt
me
my
tank
is
on
empty
(is
on
empty)..
No
patience
is
in
me
and
if
you
offend
me
I'm
liftin
you
10
feet
(liftin
you
10
feet)..
in
the
air
I
don't
care
who
is
there
and
who
saw
me
destroy
you
Go
call
you
a
lawyer,
file
you
a
lawsuit
I'll
smile
in
the
courtroom
and
buy
you
a
wardrobe
I'm
tired
of
all
you
(of
all
you)..
I
don't
mean
to
be
mean
but
that's
all
I
can
be
is
just
me
Chorus:
Eminem
And
I
am,
whatever
you
say
I
am
If
I
wasn't,
then
why
would
I
say
I
am?
In
the
paper,
the
news
everyday
I
am
Radio
won't
even
play
my
jam
Cause
I
am,
whatever
you
say
I
am
If
I
wasn't,
then
why
would
I
say
I
am?
In
the
paper,
the
news
everyday
I
am
I
don't
know
it's
just
the
way
I
am
[Eminem]
Sometimes
I
just
feel
like
my
father,
I
hate
to
be
bothered
with
all
of
this
nonsense
it's
constant
And,
"Oh,
it's
his
lyrical
content
-
-
the
song
'Guilty
Conscience'
has
gotten
such
rotten
responses"
And
all
of
this
controversy
circles
me
and
it
seems
like
the
media
immediately
points
a
finger
at
me
(finger
at
me)..
So
I
point
one
back
at
'em,
but
not
the
index
or
pinkie
or
the
ring
or
the
thumb,
it's
the
one
you
put
up
when
you
don't
give
a
fuck,
when
you
won't
just
put
up
with
the
bullshit
they
pull,
cause
they
full
of
shit
too
When
a
dude's
gettin
bullied
and
shoots
up
his
school
and
they
blame
it
on
Marilyn
(on
Marilyn)..
and
the
heroin
Where
were
the
parents
at?
And
look
where
it's
at
Middle
America,
now
it's
a
tragedy
Now
it's
so
sad
to
see,
an
upper
class
ci-ty
havin
this
happenin
(this
happenin)..
then
attack
Eminem
cause
I
rap
this
way
(rap
this
way)..
But
I'm
glad
cause
they
feed
me
the
fuel
that
I
need
for
the
fire
to
burn
and
it's
burnin
and
I
have
returned
Chorus
[Eminem]
I'm
so
sick
and
tired
of
bein
admired
that
I
wish
that
I
would
just
die
or
get
fired
and
dropped
from
my
label
and
stop
with
the
fables
I'm
not
gonna
be
able
to
top
on
"My
Name
is.."
And
pigeon-holed
into
some
pop-py
sensation
to
cop
me
rotation
at
rock'n'roll
stations
And
I
just
do
not
got
the
patience
(got
the
patience)..
to
deal
with
these
cocky
caucasians
who
think
I'm
some
wigger
who
just
tries
to
be
black
cause
I
talk
with
an
accent,
and
grab
on
my
balls,
so
they
always
keep
askin
the
same
fuckin
questions
(fuckin
questions)..
What
school
did
I
go
to,
what
hood
I
grew
up
in
The
why,
the
who
what
when,
the
where,
and
the
how
'til
I'm
grabbin
my
hair
and
I'm
tearin
it
out
cause
they
drivin
me
crazy
(drivin
me
crazy)..
I
can't
take
it
I'm
racin,
I'm
pacin,
I
stand
and
I
sit
And
I'm
thankful
for
ev-ery
fan
that
I
get
But
I
can't
take
a
SHIT,
in
the
bathroom
without
someone
standin
by
it
No
I
won't
sign
your
autograph
You
can
call
me
an
asshole
I'm

Dr.

said,
"Slim

Uh-uhhh!
"So

Well
since
age
twelve,
I've
felt
like
I'm
someone
else
Cause
I
hung
my
original
self
from
the
top
bunk
with
a
belt
Got
pissed
off
and
ripped
Pamela
Lee's
tits
off
And
smacked
her
so
hard
I
knocked
her
clothes
backwards
like
Kris
Kross
I
smoke
a
fat
pound
of
grass
and
fall
on
my
ass
faster
than
the
fat
bitch
who
sat
down
too
fast
C'mere
slut!
(Shady,
wait

I

My
English
teacher
wanted
to
fuck
me
in
junior
high
the
only
problem
was,
my
english
teacher
was
a
guy.
I
smacked
him
in
his
face
with
an
eraser,
chased
him
with
a
stapler
and
stapled
his
nuts
to
a
stack
of
paper
(Owwwwwwww!)
Walked
in
the
strip
club,
had
my
jacket
zipped
up
Flashed
the
bartender,
then
stuck
my
dick
in
the
tip
cup
Extraterrestrial,
killin
pedestrians
Rapin
lesbians
while
they
screamin::
"LET'S
JUST

Ninety-nine
percent
of
my
life
I
was
lied
to
I
just
found
out
my
mom
does
more
dope
than
I
do
I
told
her
I'd
grow
up
to
be
a
famous
rapper
Make
a
record
about
doin
drugs
and
name
it
after
her
(Oh
thank
you!)
You
know
you
blew
up
when
the
women
rush
the
stands
and
try
to
touch
your
hands
like
some
screamin
Usher
fans
(Aaahhhhhh!)
This
guy
at
White
Castle
asked
for
my

Dr.

don't
just
stand
there,
OPERATE!
I'm
not

it's
too
scary
to
die
I'll
have
to
be
carried
inside
the
cemetery
and
buried
alive
Am

I
can
barely

I
just

All
my

I
was

I
ain't

in
years,
and
my

are
too
hairy
to
hide
(Whoops!)
Clothes
ripped
like
the
Incredible

(hachhh-too)
I
spit
when
I
talk,
I'll
fuck

walks
(C'mere)
When
I

I
used

I

HOW

GONNA
BREAST

MOM?
(WAH!)
YOU
AIN'T

(WAHHH!)
I
lay

in

Put
a
bulleproof

on

shoot
myself
in

(BANG!)
I'm
steamin

The

I
can't

And
even

Dear
Slim,
I

but
you
still
ain't
callin
I
left
my
cell,
my
pager,
and
my
home
phone
at
the
bottom
I
sent
two
letters
back
in
autumn,
you
must
not-a
got
'em
There
probably
was
a
problem
at
the
post
office
or
somethin'
Sometimes
I
scribble
addresses
too
sloppy
when
I
jot
'em
but
anyways;
fuck
it,
what's
been
up?
Man
how's
your
daughter?
My
girlfriend's
pregnant
too,
I'm
bout
to
be
a
father
If
I
have
a
daughter,
guess
what
I'ma
call
her?
I'ma
name
her
Bonnie
I
read
about
your
Uncle
Ronnie
too
I'm
sorry
I
had
a
friend
kill
himself
over
some
bitch
who
didn't
want
him
I
know
you
probably
hear
this
everyday,
but
I'm
your
biggest
fan
I
even
got
the
underground
shit
that
you
did
with
Scam
I
got
a
room
full
of
your
posters
and
your
pictures
man
I
like
the
shit
you
did
with
Ruckus
too,
that
shit
was
fat
Anyways,
I
hope
you
get
this
man,
hit
me
back,
just
to
chat,
truly
yours,
your
biggest
fan
This

man,
he's
only
six
years
old
We
waited
in
the
blistering
cold
for
you
four
hours
and
you
just
said,
"No."
That's
pretty
shitty
man
-
you're
like
his
fuckin
idol
He
wants
to
be
just
like
you
man,
he
likes
you
more
than
I
do
I
ain't
that
mad
though,
I
just
don't
like
being
lied
to
Remember
when
we
met
in
Denver?
You
said
if
I'd
write
you,
you
would
write
back
See,
I'm
just
like
you
in
a
way;
I
never
knew
my
father
neither
He
used
to
always
cheat
on
my
mom
and
beat
her
I
can
relate
to
what
you're
saying
in
your
songs
So
when
I
have
a
shitty
day,
I
drift
away
and
put
'em
on
Cause
I
don't
really
got
shit
else
So
that
shit
helps
when
I'm
depressed
I
even
got
a
tattoo
of
your
name
across
the
chest
Sometimes
I
even
cut
myself
to
see
how
much
it
bleeds
It's
like
adrenaline,
the
pain
is
such
a
sudden
rush
for
me
See
everything
you
say
is
real
And
I
respect
you
cause
you
tell
it
My
girlfriend's
jealous
cause
I
talk
about
you
24/7
But
she
don't
know
you
like
I
know
you,
Slim,
no
one
does
She
don't
know
what
it
was
like
for
people
like
us
growin'
up
You
gotta
call
me,
man
I'll
be
the
biggest
fan
you'll
ever
lose,
sincerely
yours,
Stan
P.S.
We
should
be
together
too
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'll
all
be
gray,
but
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so
bad
Dear
Mr.
I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll
be
the
last
package
I
ever
send
your
ass
It's
been
six
months
and
still
no
word

I
don't
deserve
it?
I
know
you
got
my
last
two
letters
I
wrote
the
addresses
on
'em
perfect
So
this
is
my
cassette
I'm
sending
you,
I
hope
you
hear
it
I'm
in
the
car
right
now,
I'm
doing
90
on
the
freeway
Hey,
Slim,
I
drank
a
fifth
of
vodka,
you
dare
me
to
drive?
You
know
the
song
by
Phil
Collins
"In
the
Air
of
the
Night"
about
that
guy
who
could've
saved
that
other
guy
from
drownin'
But
didn't,
then
Phil
saw
it
all,
then
at
a
show
he
found
him?
That's
kinda
how
this
is
You
could've
rescued
me
from
drowning
Now
it's
too
late,
I'm
on
a
thousand
downers
now,
I'm
drowsy
And
all
I
wanted
was
a
lousy
letter
or
a
call
I
hope
you
know
I
ripped
all
of
your
pictures
off
the
wall
I
loved
you,
Slim,
we
could've
been
together

think
about
it!
You
ruined
it
now,
I
hope
you
can't
sleep
and
you
dream
about
it
And
when
you
dream
I
hope
you
can't
sleep
and
you
scream
about
it
I
hope
your
conscience
eats
at
you
and
you
can't
breathe
without
me
See,
Slim--shut
up,
bitch!
I'm
tryin'
to
talk
Hey,
Slim,
that's
my
girlfriend
screamin'
in
the
trunk
But
I
didn't
slit
her
throat,
I
just
tied
her
up,
see,
I
ain't
like
you
Cause
if
she
suffocates
she'll
suffer
more
And
then
she'll
die
too
Well,
gotta
go,
I'm
almost
at
the
bridge
now
Oh
shit,
I
forgot,
how
am
I
supposed
to
send
this
shit
out?
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'll
all
be
gray,
but
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so
bad
Dear,
Stan,
I
meant
to
write
you
sooner,
but
I
just
been
busy
You
said
your
girlfriend's
pregnant
now.
How
far
along
is
she?
Look,
I'm
really
flattered
you
would
call
your
daughter
that
And
here's
an
autograph
for
your
brother
I
wrote
it
on
a
Starter
cap
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
see
you
at
the
show,
I
must've
missed
you
Don't
think
I
did
that
shit
intentionally
just
to
diss
you
But
what's
this
shit
you
said
about
you
like
to
cut
your
wrists
too?
I
say
that
shit
just
clowning,
dawg
Come
on,
how
fucked
up
is
you?
You
got
some
issues,
Stan,
I
think
you
need
some
counselin'
To
help
your
ass
from
bouncin'
off
the
walls
When
you
get
down
some
And
what's
this
shit
about
us
meant
to
be
together?
That
type
of
shit'll
make
me
not
want
us
to
meet
each
other
I
really
think
you
and
your
girlfriend
need
each
other
Or
maybe
you
just
need
to
treat
her
better
I
hope
you
get
to
read
this
letter
I
just
hope
it
reaches
you
in
time
Before
you
hurt
yourself,
I
think
that
you'll
be
doing
just
fine
If
you
relax
a
little,
I'm
glad
I
inspire
you
But
Stan,
why
are
you
so
mad?
Try
to
understand
that
I
do
want
you
as
a
fan
I
just
don't
want
you
to
do
some
crazy
shit;
I
seen
this
one
shit
on
the
news
a
couple
weeks
ago
that
made
me
sick
Some
dude
was
drunk
and
drove
his
car
over
a
bridge
And
had
his
girlfriend
in
the
trunk
And
she
was
pregnant
with
his
kid
And
in
the
car
they
found
a
tape
But
they
didn't
say
who
it
was
to
Come
to
think
about
it,
his
name
was
it
was
you,
damn!
Look,
if
you
had
one
shot,
one
opportunity
To
seize
everything
you
ever
wanted-One
moment
Would
you
capture
it
or
just
let
it
slip?
His
palms
are
sweaty,
knees
weak,
arms
are
heavy
There's
vomit
on
his
sweater
already,
mom's
spaghetti
He's
nervous,
but
on
the
surface
he
looks
calm
and
ready
To
drop
bombs,
but
he
keeps
on
forgettin
What
he
wrote
down,
the
whole
crowd
goes
so
loud
He
opens
his
mouth,
but
the
words
won't
come
out
He's
chokin,
how
everybody's
jokin
now
The
clock's
run
out,
time's
up
over,
bloah!
Snap
back
to
reality,
Oh
there
goes
gravity
Oh,
there
goes
Rabbit,
he
choked
He's
so
mad,
but
he
won't
give
up
that
Easy,
no
He
won't
have
it
,
he
knows
his
whole
back's
to
these
ropes
It
don't
matter,
he's
dope
He
knows
that,
but
he's
broke
He's
so
stacked
that
he
knows
When
he
goes
back
to
his
mobile
home,
that's
when
it's
Back
to
the
lab
again
yo
This
whole
rap
shit
He
better
go
capture
this
moment
and
hope
it
don't
pass
him
You
better
lose
yourself
in
the
music,
the
moment
You
own
it,
you
better
never
let
it
go
You
only
get
one
shot,
do
not
miss
your
chance
to
blow
This
opportunity
comes
once
in
a
lifetime

You

This

yo
The
soul's
escaping,
through
this
hole
that
it's
gaping
This
world
is
mine
for
the
taking
Make
me
king,
as
we
move
toward
a,
new
world
order
A
normal
life
is
borin,
but
superstardom's
close
to
post
mortem
It
only
grows
harder,
only
grows
hotter
He
blows
us
all
over
these
hoes
is
all
on
him
Coast
to
coast
shows,
he's
know
as
the
globetrotter
Lonely
roads,
God
only
knows
He's
grown
farther
from
home,
he's
no
father
He
goes
home
and
barely
knows
his
own
daughter
But
hold
your
nose
cuz
here
goes
the
cold
water
His
hoes
don't
want
him
no
mo,
he's
cold
product
They
moved
on
to
the
next
schmoe
who
flows
He
nose
dove
and
sold
nada
So
the
soap
opera
is
told
and
unfolds
I
suppose
it's

his
boy,
and
his
boy,
and
his
gurl
haha,

[deep

These
ideas
are,
nightmares
to
white
parents
Whose
worst
fear
is
a
child
with
dyed
hair
and
who
likes
earrings
Like
whatever
they
say
has
no
bearing
It's
so
scary
in
a
house
that
allows,
no
swearing
To
see
him
walking
around
with
his
headphones
blaring
Alone
in
his
own
zone,
cold
and
he
don't
care
He's
a
problem
child,
and
what
bothers
him
all
comes
out
When
he
talks
about,
his
fucking
dad
walking
out
Cause
he
hates
him
so
bad
that
he,
blocks
him
out
If
he
ever
saw
him
again
he'd
probably
knock
him
out
His
thoughts
are
wacked,
he's
mad
so
he's
talking
back
Talking
black,
brainwashed
from
rock
and
rap
He
sags
his
pants,
doo-rags
and
a
stocking
cap
His
step-father
hit
him
so
he
socked
him
back
And
broke
his
nose,
his
house
is
a
broken
home
There's
no
control,
he
just
lets
his
emotions
go
Sing
with
me,
sing
for
the
year
(sing
it)
Sing
for
the
laughter,
sing
for
the
tear
(Come
on!)
Sing
it
with
me,
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow,
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
Entertainment
is
changing,
intertwining
with
gangsters
In
the
land
of
the
killers
a
sinner's
mind
is
a
sanctum
Holy
or
unholy,
only
have
one
homie
Only
this
gun,
lonely
cause
don't
anyone
know
me
Yet
everybody
just
feels
like
they
can
relate
I
guess
words
are
a
mothafucka,
they
can
be
great
Or
they
can
degrade,
or
even
worse,
they
can
teach
hate
It's
like
these
kids
hang
on
every
single
statement
we
make
Like
they
worship
us,
plus
all
the
stores
ship
us
platinum
Now
how
the
fuck
did
this
metamorphosis
happen?
From
standing
on
corners
and
porches
just
rapping
To
having
a
fortune,
no
more
kissing
ass
But
then
these
critics
crucify
you,
journalists
try
to
burn
you
Fans
turn
on
you,
attorneys
all
want
a
turn
at
you
To
get
they
hands
on
every
dime
you
have
They
want
you
to
lose
your
mind
every
time
you
mad
So
they
can
try
to
make
you
out
to
look
like
a
loose
cannon
Any
dispute
won't
hesitate
to
produce
handguns
That's
why
these
prosecutors
wanna
convict
me
Strictly
just
to
get
me
off
of
these
streets
quickly
But
all
their
kids
been
listening
to
me
religiously
So
I'm
signing
CD's
while
police
fingerprint
me
They're
for
the
judge's
daughter
but
his
grudge
is
against
me
If
I'm
such
a
fucking
menace
this
shit
doesn't
make
sense
B
It's
all
political,
if
my
music
is
literal
Then
I'm
a
criminal,
how
the
fuck
can
I
raise
a
little
girl?
I
couldn't,
I
wouldn't
be
fit
to
You're
full
of
shit
too
Guerrera;
that
was
a
fist
that
hit
you
Sing
with
me,
sing
for
the
year
(sing
it)
Sing
for
the
laughter,
sing
for
the
tear
(sing
this
shit!)
Sing
it
with
me,
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow,
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
They
say
music
can
alter
moods
and
talk
to
you
Well,
can
it
load
a
gun
up
for
you
and
cock
it
too?
Well
if
it
can,
and
the
next
time
you
assault
a
dude
Just
tell
the
judge
it
was
my
fault,
and
I'll
get
sued
See
what
these
kids
do
is
hear
'bout
us
toting
pistols
And
they
wanna
get
one
cause,
they
think
the
shit's
cool
Not
knowing
we
really
just
protecting
ourselves
We
entertainers,
of
course
the
shit's
affecting
our
sales
You
ignoramus,
but
music
is
reflection
of
self
We
just
explain
it,
and
then
we
get
our
checks
in
the
mail
It's
fucked
up
ain't
it?
How
we
can
come
from
practically
nothing
To
being
able
to
have
any
fucking
thing
that
we
wanted
That's
why
we,
sing
for
these
kids
who
don't
have
a
thing
Except
for
a
dream
and
a
fucking
rap
magazine
Who
post
pin-up
pictures
on
they
walls
all
day
long
Idolize
their
favorite
rappers
and
know
all
their
songs
Or
for
anyone
who's
ever
been
through
shit
in
they
lives
So
they
sit
and
they
cry
at
night
wishing
they'd
die
'til
they
throw
on
a
rap
record
and
they
sit
and
they
vibe
We're
nothing
to
you,
but
we're
the
fucking
shit
in
their
eyes
That's
why
we,
seize
the
moment
try
to
freeze
it
and
own
it
Squeeze
it
and
hold
it,
cause
we
consider
these
minutes
golden
And
maybe
they'll
admit
it
when
we're
gone
Just
let
our
spirits
live
on
Through
our
lyrics
that
you
hear
in
our
songs
and
we
can
Sing
with
me,
sing
for
the
year
(sing
it)
Sing
for
the
laughter,
sing
for
the
tear
(Come
on!)
Sing
it
with
me,
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow,
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away
Sing
with
me,
sing
for
the
year
(sing
it)
Sing
for
the
laughter,
sing
for
the
tear
(Come
on!)
Sing
it
with
me,
just
for
today
Maybe
tomorrow,
the
good
Lord
will
take
you
away

I've
created
a
monsta,
'cuz
nobody
wants
to
See
Marshall
no
more,
they
want
Shady,
I'm
chopped
liver.
Well,
if
you
want
Shady,
this
is
what
I'll
give
ya
A
little
bit
of
weed
mixed
with
some
hard
liquor
Some
vodka
that
will
jumpstart
my
heart
quicka
Then
a
shock
when
I
get
shocked
at
the
hospital
By
the
doctor
when
I'm
not
cooperating
When
I'm
rockin'
the
table
while
he's
operating
"Hey!"
You
waited
this
long
to
stop
debating
'Cuz
I'm
back,
I'm
on
the
rag
and
ovulating
I
know
that
you
got
a
job
Mrs.
Cheney
But
your
husband's
heart
problem
is
complicating
So
the
FCC
won't
let
me
be
Or
let
me
be
me
so
let
me
see
They
tried
to
shut
me
down
on
MTV
But
it
feels
so
empty
without
me
So
come
on
dip,
bum
on
your
lips
Fuck
that
Come
on
your
lips
and
some
on
your
tits,
And
get
ready
'cuz
this
shit's
about
to
get
heavy
I
just
settled
all
my
lawsuits,
"Fuck
you
Debbie!"
Chorus:
Now
this
looks
like
a
job
for
me
So
everybody
just
follow
me
'Cuz
we
need
a
little
controversy,
'Cuz
it
feels
so
empty
without
me
I
said
this
looks
like
a
job
for
me
So
everybody
just
follow
me
'Cuz
we
need
a
little
controversy,
'Cuz
it
feels
so
empty
without
me
Little
hellions,
kids
feelin'
rebellious
Embarrassed,
their
parents
still
listen
to
Elvis
They
start
feelin'
like
prisoners,
helpless,
'Til
someone
comes
along
on
a
mission
and
yells
"BITCH!"
A
visionary,
vision
is
scary,
could
start
a
revolution,
Pollutin'
the
air
waves
A
rebel,
So
let
me
just
revel
and
bask,
In
the
fact
that
I
got
everyone
kissin'
my
ass
And
it's
a
disaster,
such
a
catastrophe
For
you
to
see
so
damn
much
of
my
ass,
you
asked
for
me?
Well
I'm
back
(Da
Na
Na
Na
Na
Na
Na
Na
Na
Na)
fix
your
bent
antenna
Tune
it
in
and
then
I'm
gonna
enter
Into
the
front
of
your
skin
like
a
splinter
The
center
of
attention
back
for
the
winter
I'm
interesting,
the
best
thing
since
wrestling
Infesting
in
your
kids
ears
and
nesting
"Testing:
Attention
Please!"
Feel
the
tension
soon
as
someone
mentions
me
Here's
my
10
cents,
my
2
cents
is
free
A
nuisance,
who
sent,
you
sent
for
me?
(Chorus
2x)
Verse
3:
A
tisk-it
a
task-it,
I
go
tit
for
tat
with
anybody
who's
talkin'
this
shit,
that
shit
Chris
Kirkpatrick,
you
can
get
your
ass
kicked
Worse
than
them
little
Limp
Bizkit
bastards,
And
Moby?,
you
can
get
stoned
by
Obie,
You
36
year-old
bald-headed
fag
blow
me
You
don't
know
me,
you're
too
old
Let
go,
it's
over,
nobody
listens
to
techno
Now
let's
go,
just
give
me
the
signal
I'll
be
there
with
a
whole
list
full
of
new
insults
I
been
dope,
suspenseful
with
a
pencil
Ever
since
Prince
turned
himself
into
a
symbol
(knife
scrapes)
But
sometimes
the
shit
just
seems,
Everybody
only
wants
to
discuss
me
So
this
must
mean
I'm
disgusting,
But
it's
just
me
I'm
just
obscene
Though
I'm
not
the
first
king
of
controversy
I
am
the
worst
thing
since
Elvis
Presley,
To
do
Black
music
so
selfishly
And
use
it
to
get
myself
wealthy
(Hey!)
There's
a
concept
that
works
20
million
other
white
rappers
emerge
But
no
matta
how
many
fish
in
the
sea
It'll
be
so
empty
without
me
(Chorus
2x)
(Sung
twice:)
Heh-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la,
la-la-la-la
"Kids!"
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart,
left
right
left,
we
all
fall
down...
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left,
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
I'm
supposed
to
be
the
soldier
Who
never
blows
his
composure
Even
though
I
hold
the
weight
of
the
whole
world
on
my
shoulders,
I
ain't
never
supposed
to
show
it
My
crew
ain't
supposed
to
know
it
Even
if
it
means
going
toe
to
toe
with
a
Benzino
It
don't
matter
I'd
never
drag
them
in
battles
that
I
can
handle
'Less
I
absolutely
have
to,
I'm
supposed
to
set
an
example
I
need
to
be
the
leader,
my
crew
looks
for
me
to
guide
'em
If
some
shit
ever
does
pop
off,
I'm
supposed
to
be
beside
'em
That
Ja
shit,
I
tried
to
squash
it
It
was
too
late
to
stop
it
There's
a
certain
line
you
just
don't
cross,
and
he
crossed
it
I
heard
him
say
Hailie's
name
on
a
song
And
I
just
lost
it
it
was
crazy
The
shit
went
way
beyond
some
Jay
Z
and
Nas
shit
And
even
though
the
battle
is
won,
I
feel
like
we
lost
it
I
spent
so
much
energy
on
it,
honestly
I'm
exhausted
And
I'm
so
caught
in
it
I
almost
feel
I'm
the
one
who
caused
it
This
ain't
what
I'm
in
hip
hop
for,
it's
not
why
I
got
in
it
That
was
never
my
object,
for
someone
to
get
killed
Why
would
I
want
to
destroy
something
I
helped
build?
It
wasn't
my
intentions,
my
intentions
were
good
I
went
through
my
whole
career
without
ever
mentioning
And
that
was
just
outta
respect,
for
not
running
my
mouth
And
talking
about
something
that
I
knew
nothing
about
Plus
Dre
told
me
stay
out,
this
just
wasn't
my
beef
So
I
did,
I
just
fell
back,
watched
and
gritted
my
teeth
While
he's
all
over
TV
Down-talking
the
man
who
literally
saved
my
life
Like,
fuck
it,
I
understand
This
is
business,
and
this
shit
just
isn't
none
of
my
business
I'm
still
knowing
this
shit
could
pop
off
at
any
minute,
cause
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
There
used
to
be
a
time
when
you
could
just
say
a
rhyme
and
Wouldn't
have
to
worry
about
one
of
your
people
dyin'
But
now
it's
elevated
Cause
once
you
put
someone's
kids
in
it
The
shit
gets
escalated
it
ain't
just
words
no
more,
is
it?
It's
a
different
ball
game
You
call
names
and
you
ain't
just
rappin'
We
actually
tried
to
stop
the
50
and
Ja
beef
from
happenin'
Me
and
Dre
had
sat
with
him
Kicked
it
and
had
a
chat
with
him
And
asked
him
not
to
start
it,
he
wasn't
gonna
go
after
him
Until
Ja
started
yappin'
in
magazines
how
he
stabbed
him
Fuck
it,
"50,
smash
him!
Mash
him
and
let
him
have
it!"
Meanwhile
my
attention's
pulled
in
another
direction
Some
receptionist
at
the
Source
Who
answers
phones
at
his
desk
Has
an
erection
for
me
and
thinks
that
I'll
be
his
resurrection
Tries
to
blow
the
dust
off
his
mic
and
make
a
new
record
But
now
he's
fucked
the
game
up,
cause
one
of
the
ways
I
came
up,
Was
through
that
publication
The
same
one
that
made
me
famous
Now
the
owner
of
it
has
got
a
grudge
against
me
for
nothin'?
Well,
fuck
it,
that
mothafucka
could
get
it
too,
fuck
him
then!
But
I'm
so
busy
being
pissed
off,
I
don't
stop
to
think
That
we
just
inherited
50's
beef
with
Murder
Inc
And
he's
inherited
mine,
which
is
fine
Ain't
like
either
of
us
mind
We
still
have
soldiers
that's
on
the
front
line
That's
willing
to
die
for
us
as
soon
as
we
give
the
orders
Never
to
extort
us,
strictly
to
show
they
support
us
And
maybe
shout
'em
out
in
a
rap
or
up
in
the
chorus
To
show
'em
we
love
'em
back
And
let
them
know
how
important
it
is
To
have
Runyon
Avenue
soldiers
up
in
our
corners
Their
loyalty
to
us
is
worth
more
than
any
award
is
But
I
ain't
tryin'
to
have
none
of
my
people
hurt
or
murdered
It
ain't
worth
it,
I
can't
think
of
a
perfecter
way
to
word
it
Than
to
just
say
that
I
love
y'all
too
much
to
see
the
verdict
I'll
walk
away
from
it
all
'fore
I
let
it
go
any
further
But
don't
get
it
twisted,
it's
not
a
plea
that
I'm
coppin'
I'm
just
willing
to
be
the
bigger
man
if
y'all
can
quit
poppin'
Off
at
your
jaws,
well,
then
I
can
Cause
frankly
I'm
sick
of
talkin'.
I'm
not
going
to
let
someone
else's
coffin
rest
on
my
conscience,
cause
Step
by
step,
heart
to
heart
Left,
right,
left
we
all
fall
down
Like
toy
soldiers
Bit
by
bit,
torn
apart
We
never
win
but
the
battle
wages
on
For
toy
soldiers
May
I
have
your
attention
please?
May
I
have
your
attention
please?
Will
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
I
repeat,
will
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
We're
gonna
have
a
problem
here
Y'all
act
like
ya
never
seen
a
white
person
before
Jaws
all
on
the
floor
like
Pam,
like
Tommy
just
burst
in
the
door
And
started
whooping
her
ass
worse
than
before
They
first
were
divorce,
throwin?her
over
furniture
(Ahh!)
It's
the
return
of
the..."Ah,
wait,
no
way,
you're
kidding,
he
didn't
just
say
what
I
think
he
did,
did
he?"
And
Dr.
Dre
said...
Nothing
you
idiots!
Dr.
Dre's
dead,
he's
locked
in
my
basement!
(Ha-ha!)
Feminist
women
love
Eminem
"Slim
Shady,
I'm
sick
of
him
Look
at
him,
walking
around
grabbing
his
you-know-what
Flipping
the
you-know-who,
yeah,
but
he's
so
cute
though"
Yeah,
I
probably
got
a
couple
of
screws
up
in
my
head
loose
But
no
worse
than
what's
going
on
in
your
parents'
bedrooms
Sometimes,
I
wanna
get
on
TV
and
just
let
loose,
but
can't
But
it's
cool
for
Tom
Green
to
hump
a
dead
moose
"My
bum
is
on
your
lips,
my
bum
is
on
your
lips"
And
if
I'm
lucky,
you
might
just
give
it
a
little
kiss
And
that's
the
message
that
we
deliver
to
little
kids
And
expect
them
not
to
know
what
a
woman's
clitoris
is
Of
course
they
gonna
know
what
intercourse
is
By
the
time
they
hit
fourth
grade
They
got
the
Discovery
Channel
don't
they?
"We
ain't
nothing
but
mammals"
Well,
some
of
us
cannibals
Who
cut
other
people
open
like
cantaloupes
But
if
we
can
hump
dead
animals
and
antelopes
Then
there's
no
reason
that
a
man
and
another
man
can't
elope
But
if
you
feel
like
I
feel,
I
got
the
anecdote
Women
wave
your
panty-hoes,
sing
the
chorus
and
it
goes
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up
Cuz
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up
Will
Smith
don't
gotta
cuss
in
his
raps
to
sell
records
Well
I
do
so
"Fuck
him
and
fuck
you
too!"
You
think
I
give
a
damn
about
a
Grammy?
Half
of
you
critics
can't
even
stomach
me
let
alone
stand
me
"But
Slim,
what
if
you
win,
wouldn't
it
be
weird?"
Why?
So
you
guys
could
just
lie
to
get
me
here
So
you
can
sit
me
here
next
to
Britney
Spears
Shit
Christina
Aguilera
better
switch
me
chairs
So
I
can
sit
next
to
Carson
Daly
and
Fred
Durst
And
hear
them
argue
over
who
she
gave
head
to
first
You
little
bitch,
put
me
on
blast
on
MTV
"Yeah,
he's
cute,
but
I
think
he's
married
to
Kim,
hee-hee"
I
should
download
her
audio
on
MP3
and
show
the
whole
world
how
you
gave
Eminem
VD
I'm
sick
of
you
little
girl
and
boy
groups
All
you
do
is
annoy
me
so
I
have
been
sent
here
to
destroy
you
And
there's
a
million
of
us
just
like
me
Who
cuss
like
me;
who
just
don't
give
a
fuck
like
me
Who
dress
like
me;
walk,
talk
and
act
like
me
And
just
might
be
the
next
best
thing
but
not
quite
me!
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up
Cuz
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up
I'm
like
a
head
trip
to
listen
to
cuz
I'm
only
giving
you
Things
you
joke
about
with
your
friends
inside
your
living
room
The
only
difference
is
I
got
the
balls
to
say
it
In
front
of
y'all
and
I
don't
gotta
be
frost
or
sugar
coated
at
all
I
just
get
on
a
mic
and
spit
it
and
whether
you
like
to
admit
it
I
just
shitted
better
than
90
percent
of
you
rappers
out
there
Then
you
wonder
how
can
kids
eat
up
these
albums
like
valiums
It's
funny
cuz
at
the
rate
I'm
going
when
I'm
30
I'll
be
the
only
person
in
the
nursing
home
flirting
Pinching
nurses
asses
when
I'm
jacking
off
with
Jergens
And
I'm
jerkin?but
this
whole
bag
of
Viagra
isn't
working
And
every
single
person
is
a
Slim
Shady
lurking
He
could
be
working
at
Burger
King
spitting
on
your
onion
rings
Or
in
the
parking
lot,
circling,
screaming
"I
don't
give
a
fuck!"
With
his
windows
down
and
his
system
up
So,
will
the
real
Shady
please
stand
up?
And
put
one
of
those
fingers
on
each
hand
up?
And
be
proud
to
be
outta
ya
mind
and
outta
control
And
one
more
time,
loud
as
you
can,
how
does
it
go?
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up
Cuz
I'm
Slim
Shady,
yes
I'm
the
real
Shady
All
you
other
Slim
Shadys
are
just
imitating
So
won't
the
real
Slim
Shady
please
stand
up?
Please
stand
up,
please
stand
up
Ha
ha
Guess
there's
a
Slim
Shady
in
all
of
us
Fuck
it,
let's
all
stand
up
Yeah
I
know
sometimes
things
may
not
always
make
sense
to
you
right
now
But
hey,
what
daddy
always
tell
you?
Straighten
up
little
soldier
Stiffen
up
that
upper
lip
What
you
crying
about?
You
got
me
Hailie
I
know
you
miss
your
mom
and
I
know
you
miss
your
dad
When
I'm
gone
but
I'm
trying
to
give
you
the
life
that
I
never
had
I
can
see
you're
sad,
even
when
you
smile,
even
when
you
laugh
I
can
see
it
in
your
eyes,
deep
inside
you
want
to
cry
Cuz
you're
scared,
I
ain't
there?
Daddy's
with
you
in
your
prayers
No
more
crying,
wipe
them
tears
Daddy's
here,
no
more
nightmares
We
gon'
pull
together
through
it,
we
gon'
do
it
Laney
uncles
crazy,
aint
he?
Yeah
but
he
loves
you
girl
and
you
better
know
it
We're
all
we
got
in
this
world
When
it
spins,
when
it
swirls
When
it
whirls,
when
it
twirls
Two
little
beautiful
girls
Lookin'
puzzled,
in
a
daze
I
know
it's
confusing
you
Daddy's
always
on
the
move,
mamma's
always
on
the
news
I
try
to
keep
you
sheltered
from
it
but
somehow
it
seems
The
harder
that
I
try
to
do
that,
the
more
it
backfires
on
me
All
the
things
growing
up
his
daddy
that
he
had
to
see
Daddy
don't
want
you
to
see
but
you
see
just
as
much
as
he
did
We
did
not
plan
it
to
be
this
way,
your
mother
and
me
But
things
have
gotten
so
bad
between
us
I
don't
see
us
ever
being
together
ever
again
Like
we
used
to
be
when
we
was
teenagers
But
then
of
course
everything
always
happens
for
a
reason
I
guess
it
was
never
meant
to
be
But
it's
just
something
we
have
no
control
over
and
that's
what
destiny
is
But
no
more
worries,
rest
your
head
and
go
to
sleep
Maybe
one
day
we'll
wake
up
and
this
will
all
just
be
a
dream
Now
hush
little
baby,
don't
you
cry
Everything's
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up
little
lady,
I
told
ya
Daddy's
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
mommy's
not
here
right
now
and
we
don't
know
why
We
feel
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy,
pretty
baby
But
I
promise
momma's
gon'
be
alright
It's
funny
I
remember
back
one
year
when
daddy
had
no
money
Mommy
wrapped
the
Christmas
presents
up
And
stuck
'em
under
the
tree
and
said
some
of
'em
were
from
me
Cuz
daddy
couldn't
buy
'em
I'll
never
forget
that
Christmas
I
sat
up
the
whole
night
crying
Cuz
daddy
felt
like
a
bum,
see
daddy
had
a
job
But
his
job
was
to
keep
the
food
on
the
table
for
you
and
mom
And
at
the
time
every
house
that
we
lived
in
Either
kept
getting
broken
into
and
robbed
Or
shot
up
on
the
block
and
your
mom
was
saving
money
for
you
in
a
jar
Tryna
start
a
piggy
bank
for
you
so
you
could
go
to
college
Almost
had
a
thousand
dollars
till
someone
broke
in
and
stole
it
And
I
know
it
hurt
so
bad
it
broke
your
momma's
heart
And
it
seemed
like
everything
was
just
startin'
to
fall
apart
Mom
and
dad
was
arguin'
a
lot
so
momma
moved
back
On
the
Chalmers
in
the
flat
one
bedroom
apartment
And
dad
moved
back
to
the
other
side
of
8
Mile
on
Novara
And
that's
when
daddy
went
to
California
with
his
CD
and
met
Dr.
Dre
And
flew
you
and
momma
out
to
see
me
But
daddy
had
to
work,
you
and
momma
had
to
leave
me
Then
you
started
seeing
daddy
on
the
T.V.
and
momma
didn't
like
it
And
you
and
Laney
were
to
young
to
understand
it
Papa
was
a
rollin'
stone,
momma
developed
a
habit
And
it
all
happened
too
fast
for
either
one
of
us
to
grab
it
I'm
just
sorry
you
were
there
and
had
to
witness
it
first
hand
Cuz
all
I
ever
wanted
to
do
was
just
make
you
proud
Now
I'm
sittin
in
this
empty
house,
just
reminiscing
Lookin'
at
your
baby
pictures,
it
just
trips
me
out
To
see
how
much
you
both
have
grown,
it's
almost
like
you're
sisters
now
Wow,
guess
you
pretty
much
are
and
daddy's
still
here
Laney
I'm
talkin'
to
you
too,
daddy's
still
here
I
like
the
sound
of
that,
yeah
It's
got
a
ring
to
it
don't
it?
Shh,
momma's
only
gone
for
the
moment
Now
hush
little
baby,
don't
you
cry
Everything's
gonna
be
alright
Stiffen
that
upper
lip
up
little
lady,
I
told
ya
Daddy's
here
to
hold
ya
through
the
night
I
know
mommy's
not
here
right
now
and
we
don't
know
why
We
feel
how
we
feel
inside
It
may
seem
a
little
crazy,
pretty
baby
But
I
promise
momma's
gon'
be
alright
And
if
you
ask
me
too
Daddy's
gonna
buy
you
a
mockingbird
I'mma
give
you
the
world
I'mma
buy
a
diamond
ring
for
you
I'mma
sing
for
you
I'll
do
anything
for
you
to
see
you
smile
And
if
that
mockingbird
don't
sing
and
that
ring
don't
shine
I'mma
break
that
birdies
neck
I'd
go
back
to
the
jewler
who
sold
it
to
ya
And
make
him
eat
every
carat
don't
fuck
with
dad
(haha)
Meet
Eddie,
23
years
old.
Fed
up
with
life
and
the
way
things
are
going
(I'm
going
fucking
insane),
he
decides
to
rob
a
liquor
store
(I
can't
take
this
no
more,
I
can't
take
it
no
more,
homes).
But
on
his
way
in
he
has
a
sudden
change
of
heart
(Shit
is
mine),
and
suddenly
(I
gotta
do
this)
his
conscience
comes
into
play
(I
gotta
do
this).
Alright,
stop
(Uh?),
now
before
you
walk
in
the
door
Of
this
liquor
store
and
try
to
get
money
out
the
drawer
You
better
think
of
the
consequence
(Who
are
you?)
I'm
your
motherfuckin'
conscience!
That's
nonsense!
Go
in,
gaffle
the
money,
and
run
to
one
of
your
aunt's
cribs
And
borrow
a
damn
dress
and
one
of
her
blond
wigs
(Can
I
borrow
this?)
Tell
her
you
need
a
place
to
stay,
you'll
be
safe
for
days
If
you
shave
your
legs
with
Renee's
razor
blades
Yeah,
but
if
it
all
goes
through
like
it's
supposed
to
The
whole
neighborhood
knows
you
and
they'll
expose
you
Think
about
it
before
you
walk
in
the
door
first
Look
at
the
store
clerk,
she's
older
than
George
Burns
Fuck
that,
do
that
shit!
Shoot
that
bitch!
Can
you
afford
to
blow
this
shit,
are
you
that
rich?
Why
you
give
a
fuck
if
she
dies?
Are
you
that
bitch?
Do
you
really
think
she
gives
a
fuck
if
you
have
kids?
Man,
don't
do
it,
it's
not
worth
it
to
risk
it
(You're
right!)
Not
over
this
shit
(Stop!),
drop
the
biscuit
(I
will!)
Don't
even
listen
to
Slim,
yo,
he's
bad
for
you
You
know
what,
Dre?
I
don't
like
your
attitude
Stan:
Come
on,
just
come
in
here
for
a
minute.
Girl:
I
don't
know.
Stan:
Look...
Girl:
Damn.
Stan:
Look,
it's
gonna
be
alright,
alright?
Girl:
Oh—okay.
Stan:
Give
me
a
kiss.
Pull
your
pants
off,
come
on.
Meet
Stan,
21
years
old.
After
meeting
a
young
girl
at
a
rave
party,
things
start
getting
hot
and
heavy
in
an
upstairs
bedroom.
Once
again,
his
conscience
comes
into
play.
Now
listen
to
me,
while
you're
kissin'
her
cheek
And
smearin'
her
lipstick,
I
slipped
this
in
her
drink
Now
all
you
gotta
do
is
nibble
on
this
little
bitch's
earlobe
Yo,
this
girl's
only
fifteen
years
old
You
shouldn't
take
advantage
of
her,
it's
not
fair
Yo,
look
at
her
bush,
does
it
got
hair?
(Huh-uh)
Fuck
this
bitch
right
here
on
the
spot,
bare
'Til
she
passes
out
and
she
forgot
how
she
got
there
Man,
ain't
you
ever
seen
that
one
movie
Kids?
No,
but
I
seen
the
porno
with
Sun
Doobiest
Shit,

wanna
get
hauled
off
to
jail?
Man,
fuck
that,
hit
that
shit
raw
dog,
then
bail
(Man,
it
feels
good
to
be
home.)
Meet
Grady,
a
29-year-old
construction
worker.
After
coming
home
from
a
hard
day's
work,
he
walks
in
the
door
of
his
trailer
park
home
to
find
his
wife
in
bed
with
another
man.
(What
the
fuck!?
—
Grady!)
Alright,
calm
down,
relax,
start
breathin'
Fuck
that
shit,
you
just
caught
this
bitch
cheatin'
While
you
at
work
she's
with
some
dude
tryin'
to
get
off
Fuck
slittin'
her
throat,
cut
this
bitch's
head
off!
Wait,
what
if
there's
an
explanation
for
this
shit?
What,
she
tripped,
fell,
landed
on
his
dick?
Alright,
Shady,
maybe
he's
right,
Grady
But
think
about
the
baby
before
you
get
all
crazy
Okay,
thought
about
it?
Still
wanna
stab
her?
Grab
her
by
the
throat,
get
your
daughter
and
kidnap
her?
That's
what
I
did,
be
smart,
don't
be
a
retard
You
gonna
take
advice
from
somebody
who
slapped
Dee
Barnes?
(What
you
say?)
What's
wrong?
Didn't
think
I'd
remember?
(I'ma
kill
you,
motherfucker!)
Huh-uh-uh,
temper,

Dre,

How

'Cause

same
route

I

Been

Aw,

Shoot

Where's

and
demonstrated
against,
picket
signs
for
my
wicked
rhymes,
look
at
the
times,
sick
is
the
mind
of
the
motherfuckin'
kid
that's
behind,
all
this
commotion,
emotions
run
deep
as
ocean's
explodin',
tempers
flaring
from
parents,
just
blow
'em
off
and
keep
goin',
not
takin'
nothin'
from
no
one,
give
'em
hell
long
as
i'm
breathin',
keep
kickin'
ass
in
the
mornin',
an'
takin'
names
in
the
evening,
leave
'em
with
a
taste
as
sour
as
vinegar
in
they
mouth,
see
they
can
trigger
me
but
they'll
never
figure
me
out,
look
at
me
now,
I
bet
ya'
probably
sick
of
me
now,
ain't
you
mama,
i'ma
make
you
look
so
ridiculous
now...
[CHORUS]
I'm
sorry
mama,
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you,
I
never
meant
to
make
you
cry,
but
tonight
i'm
cleanin'
out
my
closet,
{one
more
time},
I
said
i'm
sorry
mama,
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you,
I
never
meant
to
make
you
cry,
but
tonight
i'm
cleanin'
out
my
closet...
I
got
some
skeletons
in
my
closet
and
I
don't
know
if
no
one
knows
it,
so
before
they
thrown
me
inside
my
coffin
and
close
it,
i'ma
expose
it,
i'll
take
you
back
to
'73,
before
I
ever
had
a
multi-platinum
sellin'
Cd,
I
was
a
baby,
maybe
I
was
just
a
couple
of
months,
my
faggot
father
must
have
had
his
pantie's
up
in
a
bunch,
cause
he
split,
I
wonder
if
he
even
kissed
me
goodbye,
no
I
don't
on
second
thought,
I
just
fuckin'
wished
he
would
die,
I
look
at
Hailie
and
I
couldn't
picture
leavin'
her
side,
even
if
I
hated
Kim,
I
grit
my
teeth
and
I'd
try,
to
make
it
work
with
her
at
least
for
Hailie's
sake,
I
maybe
made
some
mistakes
but
i'm
only
human,
but
i'm
man
enough
to
face
them
today,
what
I
did
was
stupid,
no
doubt
it
was
dumb,
but
the
smartest
shit
I
did
was
take
them
bullets
out
of
that
gun,
cause
id'a
killed
'em,
shit
I
would
have
shot
Kim
and
him
both,
it's
my
life,
i'd
like
to
welcome
y'all
to
the
Eminem
show...
[CHORUS]
Now
I
would
never
diss
my
own
mama
just
to
get
recognition,
take
a
second
to
listen
who
you
think
this
record
is
dissin',
but
put
yourself
in
my
position,
just
try
to
envision
witnessin'
your
Mama
poppin'
prescription
pills
in
the
kitchen,
bitchin'
that
someone's
always
goin'
through
her
purse
and
shits
missin',
going
through
public
housing
systems,
victim
of
Munchausen's
syndrome,
my
whole
life
I
was
made
to
believe
I
was
sick
when
I
wasn't
'til
I
grew
up,
now
I
blew
up,
it
makes
you
sick
to
ya'
stomach,
doesn't
it,
wasn't
it
the
reason
you
made
that
Cd
for
me,
ma,
so
you
could
try
to
justify
the
way
you
treated
me,
ma,
but
guess
what,
your
gettin'
older
now
and
it's
cold
when
your
lonely,
and
Nathan's
growing
up
so
quick,
he's
gonna
know
that
your
phoney,
and
Hailie's
getting
so
big
now,
you
should
see
her,
she's
beautiful,
but
you'll
never
see
her,
she
won't
even
be
at
your
funeral,
see
what
hurts
me
the
most
is
you
won't
admit
you
was
wrong,
bitch,
do
your
song,
keep
tellin'
yourself
that
you
was
a
mom,
but
how
dare
you
try
to
take
what
you
didn't
help
me
to
get,
you
selfish
bitch,
I
hope
you
fuckin'
burn
in
hell
for
this
shit,
remember
when
Ronnie
died
and
you
said
you
wished
it
was
me,
well
guess
what,
I
am
dead,
dead
to
you
as
can
be...
[CHORUS]
Down
down
down
Down
down
down
Down
down
down
Down
okay
Guess
who's
back,
back
again
Shady's
back,
tell
a
friend
Now
everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
To
the
dance
floor,
to
the
dance
floor
Now
everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
Alright,
stop
pajama
time
Come
here,
little
kiddies!
On
my
lap!
Guess
who's
back
with
a
brand
new
rap?
And
I
don't
mean
"rap"
as
in
a
new
case
Of
child
molestation
accusations
Ah
ah
ah
ah
ah,
no
worries
Papa's
got
a
brand
new
bag
of
toys
What
else
could
I
possibly
do
to
make
noise?
I've
done
touched
on
everything
but
little
boys
That's
not
a
stab
at
Michael
That's
just
a
metaphor,
I'm
just
psycho
I
go
a
little
bit
crazy
sometimes
I
get
a
little
bit
out
of
control
with
my
rhymes
Good
God,
dip,
do
a
little
slide
Bend
down,
touch
your
toes,
and
just
glide
To
the
center
of
the
dance
floor
Like
TP
for
my
bung-hole
And
it's
cool
if
you
let
one
go
Nobody's
gonna
know,
who'd
hear
it?
Give
a
little
"poot
poot,"
it's
okay
*fart
sound*
Oops,
my
CD
just
skipped
And
everyone
just
heard
you
let
one
rip
Now
I'm
gonna
make
you
dance
It's
your
chance,
yeah
boy,
shake
that
ass
Whoops,
I
mean
girl
girl,
girl,
girl
Girl,
you
know
you're
my
world
Alright,
now
lose
it!
(ah
ah
ah
ah

Just
lose
it!
(ah
ah
ah
ah

Go
crazy!
(ah
ah
ah
ah

Oh,
baby
(ah
ah)
oh,
baby,
baby
(ah
ah)
It's
Friday
and
it's
my
day
Just
to
party
all
the
way
to
Sunday
Maybe
'til
Monday,
I
don't
know
what
day
Everyday's
just
a
holiday
Cruisin'
on
the
freeway,
feelin'
kind
of
breezy
Let
the
top
down
and
my
hair
blow
I
don't
know
where
I'm
goin',
all
I
know
is
When
I
get
there
someone's
gonna
(touch
my
body)
Excuse
me,
miss,
I
don't
mean
to
sound
like
a
jerk
But
I'm
feelin'
just
a
little
stressed
out
from
work
Would
you
punch
me
in
the
stomach
and
pull
my
hair
Spit
on
me,
maybe
gouge
my
eyes
out?
(Yeah)
Now,
what's
your
name,
girl?
What's
your
sign?
(Man,
you
must
be
up
out
your
mind)
Dre
(ah
ah)
beer
goggles,
blind
I'm
just
tryin'
to
unwind,
now
I'm
Now
I'm
gonna
make
you
dance
It's
your
chance,
yeah
boy,
shake
that
ass
Whoops,
I
mean
girl
girl,
girl,
girl
Girl,
you
know
you're
my
world
Alright,
now
lose
it!
(ah
ah
ah

Just
lose
it!
(ah

Go
crazy!
(ah
ah
ah

Oh,
baby
(ah

oh,
baby,
baby
(ah
ah)
It's
Tuesday
and
I'm
locked
up
I'm
in
jail
and
I
don't
know
what
happened
They
say
I
was
runnin'
butt
naked
Down
the
street
screamin'
(ah
ah
ah
ah)
Your
honor,
I'm
sorry,
I
don't
remember
All
I
know
is
this
much,
I'm
not
guilty
They
said
"Save
it,
boy,
we
got
you
on
tape
Yellin'
at
an
old
lady"
(Touch
my
body!)
Now
this
is
the
part
where
the
rap
breaks
down
It
gets
real
intense,
no
one
makes
a
sound
Everything
looks
like
it's
8
Mile
now
The
beat
comes
back
and
everybody
lose
themselves
Now
snap
back
to
reality;
look,
there's
B.
Rabbit!
"Oh,
you
signed
me
up
to
battle?
I'm
a
grown
man!"
Chuba
chuba
chuba
chuba
chuba
chuba
chubby
I
don't
have
any
lines
to
go
right
here,
so
chuba
tellytubby
Fellas!
(what?)
fellas!
(what?)
Grab
your
left
nut,
make
your
right
one
jealous
(what?)
Black
girls,
white
girls,
skinny
girls,
fat
girls
Tall
girls,
small
girls,
I'm
calling
all
girls
Everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
It's
your
chance
for
a
little
romance
or
butt
squeezin'
It's
the
season,
just
go
(ah
ah
ah
ah);
it's
so
appeasin'
Now
I'm
gonna
make
you
dance
It's
your
chance,
yeah
boy,
shake
that
ass
Whoops,
I
mean
girl
girl,
girl,
girl
Girl,
you
know
you're
my
world
Alright,

lose
it!
(ah
ah

Just

(ah
ah
ah
ah

Go

(ah
ah
ah
ah

Oh,
baby
(ah
ah)
oh,
baby,
baby
(ah
ah)
Touch
my
body
Touch
my
body
Oooh
boy,
touch
my
body
I
mean
girl,
touch
my
body
Yeah,
it's
my
life,
my
own
words
I
guess
Have
you
ever
loved
someone
so
much
You'd
give
an
arm
for
Not
the
expression,
no
Literally
give
an
arm
for
When
they
know
they're
your
heart
And
you
know
you
are
their
armor
And
you
will
destroy
anyone
who
would
try
to
harm
her
But
what
happens
when
karma
Turns
right
around
and
bites
you
And
everything
you
stand
for
turns
on
you
to
spite
you
What
happens
when
you
become
the
main
source
of
her
pain
"Daddy
look
what
I
made"
"Dad's
gotta
go
catch
a
plane"
"Daddy
where's
mommy?
I
can't
find
mommy,
where
is
she?"
"I
don't
know,
go
play,
Hailie
baby,
your
daddy's
busy
Daddy's
writing
a
song,
this
song
ain't
gon
write
itself"
I
give
you
one
underdog,
and
you
gotta
swing
by
yourself
Then
turn
right
around
in
that
song
and
tell
her
you
love
her
And
put
hands
on
her
mother
who's
the
spittin'
image
of
her
That's
Slim
Shady,
yeah
baby
Slim
Shady's
crazy
Shady
made
me
But
tonight,
Shady's
rock-a-bye
baby
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
I
keep
havin'
this
dream,
I'm
pushin'
Hailie
on
a
swing,
she
keeps
screamin',
she
don't
want
me
to
sing
"You're
makin'
mommy
cry,
why,
why
is
mommy
cryin'"
"Baby,
daddy
ain't
leavin'
no
more,
Daddy
you're
lyin'
You
always
say
that,
you
always
say
this
is
the
last
time
But
you
ain't
leavin'
no
more
daddy,
you're
mine"
She's
pilin'
boxes
in
front
of
the
door
tryin'
to
block
it
"Daddy
please,
daddy,
don't
leave,
daddy,
no,
stop
it"
Goes
in
her
pocket,
pulls
out
a
tiny
necklace
locket
It's
got
a
picture,
"This
will
keep
you
safe
daddy,
take
it
with
ya"
I
look
up,
it's
just
me
standin'
in
the
mirror
These
fuckin'
walls
must
be
talkin',
'cause
man
I
can
hear
'em
They're
sayin',
"you
got
one
more
chance
to
do
right
And
it's
tonight,
now
go
out
and
show
em
that
you
love
'em
before
it's
too
late"
And
just
as
I
go
to
walk
out
of
my
bedroom
door
It
turns
to
a
stage,
they're
gone
and
the
spotlight
is
on
and
I'm
singin'
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
Sixty
thousand
people
all
jumpin'
out
their
seat
The
curtain
closes,
they're
throwin'
roses
at
my
feet
I
take
a
bow,
and
thank
you
all
for
comin
out
They're
screamin'
so
loud,
I
take
one
last
look
at
the
crowd
I
glance
down,
I
don't
believe
what
I'm
seein'
"Daddy,
its
me,
help
mommy,
her
wrists
are
bleedin'"
But
baby
we're
in
Sweden
How
did
you
get
to
Sweden?
"I
followed
you
daddy
You
told
me
that
you
weren't
leavin'
You
lied
to
me
dad,
and
now
you
made
mommy
sad
And
I
bought
you
this
coin,
it
says
number
one
dad
That's
all
I
wanted,
I
just
want
to
give
you
this
coin"
"I
get
the
point,
fine,
me
and
mommy
are
goin'"
"But
baby
wait,
it's
too
late
dad,
you
made
your
choice
Now
go
out
there
and
show
em
that
you
love
em
more
than
us
That's
what
they
want
They
want
you,
Marshall
They
keep
screamin'
your
name
It's
no
wonder
you
can't
go
to
sleep
Just
take
another
pill,
yeah
I
bet
you
you
will!
You
rap
about
it,
yeah
word,
kid
keep
it
real"
I
hear
a
applause,
all
this
time
I
couldn't
see
How
could
it
be,
that
the
curtain
is
closin'
on
me
I
turn
around,
find
a
gun
on
the
ground
Cock
it,
put
it
to
my
brain,
scream
Die
Shady!
And
pop
it
The
sky
darkens,
my
life
flashes
The
plane
that
I
was
supposed
to
be
on,
crashes,
and
burns
to
ashes
That's
when
I
wake
up
Alarm
clock's
ringing,
there's
birds
singin'
It's
spring
and
Hailie's
outside
swingin'
I
walk
right
up
to
Kim
and
kiss
her
tell
her
I
miss
her
Hailie
just
smiles
and
winks
at
her
little
sister
almost
as
if
to
say
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'll
all
be
gray,
but
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so
bad
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got

The

clouds
up
my
window
and
I

Dear
Slim,
I
wrote
but
you
still
ain't
callin
I
left
my
cell,
my
pager,
and
my
home
phone
at
the
bottom
I
sent
two
letters
back
in
autumn,
you
must
not-a
got
'em
There
probably
was
a
problem
at
the
post
office
or
somethin'
Sometimes
I
scribble
addresses
too
sloppy
when
I
jot
'em
but
anyways;
fuck
it,
what's
been
up?
Man
how's
your
daughter?
My
girlfriend's
pregnant
too,
I'm
bout
to
be
a
father
If
I
have
a
daughter,
guess
what
I'ma
call
her?
I'ma
name
her
Bonnie
I
read
about
your
Uncle
Ronnie
too
I'm
sorry
I
had
a
friend
kill
himself
over
some
bitch
who
didn't
want
him
I
know
you
probably
hear
this
everyday,
but
I'm
your
biggest
fan
I
even
got
the
underground
shit
that
you
did
with
Scam
I
got
a
room
full
of
your
posters
and
your
pictures
man
I
like
the
shit
you
did
with
Ruckus
too,
that
shit
was
fat
Anyways,
I
hope
you
get
this
man,
hit
me
back,
just
to
chat,
truly
yours,
your
biggest
fan
This
is
Stan
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'll
all
be
gray,
but
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so
bad
Dear
Slim,
you
still
ain't
called
or
wrote,
I
hope
you
have
a
chance
I
ain't
mad
-
I
just
think
it's
FUCKED
UP
you
don't
answer
fans
If
you
didn't
wanna
talk
to
me
outside
your
concert
you
didn't
have
to,
but
you
coulda
signed
an
autograph
for
Matthew
That's
my
little
brother
man,
he's
only
six
years
old
We
waited
in
the
blistering
cold
for
you
four
hours
and
you
just
said,
"No."
That's
pretty
shitty
man
-
you're
like
his
fuckin
idol
He
wants
to
be
just
like
you
man,
he
likes
you
more
than
I
do
I
ain't
that
mad
though,
I
just
don't
like
being
lied
to
Remember
when
we
met
in
Denver?
You
said
if
I'd
write
you,
you
would
write
back
See,
I'm
just
like
you
in
a
way;
I
never
knew
my
father
neither
He
used
to
always
cheat
on
my
mom
and
beat
her
I
can
relate
to
what
you're
saying
in
your
songs
So
when
I
have
a
shitty
day,
I
drift
away
and
put
'em
on
Cause
I
don't
really
got
shit
else
So
that
shit
helps
when
I'm
depressed
I
even
got
a
tattoo
of
your
name
across
the
chest
Sometimes
I
even
cut
myself
to
see
how
much
it
bleeds
It's
like
adrenaline,
the
pain
is
such
a
sudden
rush
for
me
See
everything
you
say
is
real
And
I
respect
you
cause
you
tell
it
My
girlfriend's
jealous
cause
I
talk
about
you
24/7
But
she
don't
know
you
like
I
know
you,
Slim,
no
one
does
She
don't
know
what
it
was
like
for
people
like
us
growin'
up
You
gotta
call
me,
man
I'll
be
the
biggest
fan
you'll
ever
lose,
sincerely
yours,
Stan
P.S.
We
should
be
together
too
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds

my
window
and
I
can't

And
even
if
I
could
it'll
all

that
it's

Dear
Mr.
I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll
be
the
last
package
I
ever
send
your
ass
It's
been
six
months
and
still
no
word

I
don't
deserve
it?
I
know
you
got
my
last
two
letters
I
wrote
the
addresses
on
'em
perfect
So
this
is
my
cassette
I'm
sending
you,
I
hope
you
hear
it
I'm
in
the
car
right
now,
I'm
doing
90
on
the
freeway
Hey,
Slim,
I
drank
a
fifth
of
vodka,
you
dare
me
to
drive?
You
know
the
song
by
Phil
Collins
"In
the
Air
of
the
Night"
about
that
guy
who
could've
saved
that
other
guy
from
drownin'
But
didn't,
then
Phil
saw
it
all,
then
at
a
show
he
found
him?
That's
kinda
how
this
is
You
could've
rescued
me
from
drowning
Now
it's
too
late,
I'm
on
a
thousand
downers
now,
I'm
drowsy
And
all
I
wanted
was
a
lousy
letter
or
a
call
I
hope
you
know
I
ripped
all
of
your
pictures
off
the
wall
I
loved
you,
Slim,
we
could've
been
together

think
about
it!
You
ruined
it
now,
I
hope
you
can't
sleep
and
you
dream
about
it
And
when
you
dream
I
hope
you
can't
sleep
and
you
scream
about
it
I
hope
your
conscience
eats
at
you
and
you
can't
breathe
without
me
See,
Slim--shut
up,
bitch!
I'm
tryin'
to
talk
Hey,
Slim,
that's
my
girlfriend
screamin'
in
the
trunk
But
I
didn't
slit
her
throat,
I
just
tied
her
up,
see,
I
ain't
like
you
Cause
if
she
suffocates
she'll
suffer
more
And
then
she'll
die
too
Well,
gotta
go,
I'm
almost
at
the
bridge
now
Oh
shit,
I
forgot,
how
am
I
supposed
to
send
this
shit
out?
My
tea's
gone
cold
I'm
wondering
why
I
got
out
of
bed
at
all
The
morning
rain
clouds
up
my
window
and
I
can't
see
at
all
And
even
if
I
could
it'll
all
be
gray,
but
your
picture
on
my
wall
It
reminds
me
that
it's
not
so
bad,
it's
not
so

Dear,
Stan,
I
meant
to
write
you
sooner,
but
I
just
been
busy
You
said
your
girlfriend's
pregnant
now.
How
far
along
is
she?
Look,
I'm
really
flattered
you
would
call
your
daughter
that
And
here's
an
autograph
for
your
brother
I
wrote
it
on
a
Starter
cap
I'm
sorry
I
didn't
see
you
at
the
show,
I
must've
missed
you
Don't
think
I
did
that
shit
intentionally
just
to
diss
you
But
what's
this
shit
you
said
about
you
like
to
cut
your
wrists
too?
I
say
that
shit
just
clowning,
dawg
Come
on,
how
fucked
up
is
you?
You
got
some
issues,
Stan,
I
think
you
need
some
counselin'
To
help
your
ass
from
bouncin'
off
the
walls
When
you
get
down
some
And
what's
this
shit
about
us
meant
to
be
together?
That
type
of
shit'll
make
me
not
want
us
to
meet
each
other
I
really
think
you
and
your
girlfriend
need
each
other
Or
maybe
you
just
need
to
treat
her
better
I
hope
you
get
to
read
this
letter
I
just
hope
it
reaches
you
in
time
Before
you
hurt
yourself,
I
think
that
you'll
be
doing
just
fine
If
you
relax
a
little,
I'm
glad
I
inspire
you
But
Stan,
why
are
you
so
mad?
Try
to
understand
that
I
do
want
you
as
a
fan
I
just
don't
want
you
to
do
some
crazy
shit;
I
seen
this
one
shit
on
the
news
a
couple
weeks
ago
that
made
me
sick
Some
dude
was
drunk
and
drove
his
car
over
a
bridge
And
had
his
girlfriend
in
the
trunk
And
she
was
pregnant
with
his
kid
And
in
the
car
they
found
a
tape
But
they
didn't
say
who
it
was
to
Come
to
think
about
it,
his
name
was
it
was
you,
damn!

If
you
responded
back
with
a

rap
you
wrote
for
Canibus
I
strangled
you
to
death
then
I
choked
you
again
Then
break

your

You
beef

I'ma
even
the

Take
you
on

Springer,
and
beat
yer
ass
legally
I
get
you
blunted
off

Cause
when
I
smoke
out
I
hit
the

harder
than
Sonny
Bono
(Ohh
no!!)
So
if
I
said
I
never
did
drugs
That
would
mean
I
lie
AND
get
fucked
more
than
the

does
Hillary
Clinton
tried
to
slap
me
and
call
me
a

I
ripped
her
fuckin
tonsils
out

fed
her

My

hurt,
and
lately
I'm
on

Grabbed

ripped

I
ever

Follow

what

says:
smoke
weed,
take
pills,
drop
outta
school,
kill
people
and
drink
And
jump
behind
the
wheel
like
it
was
still
legal
I'm
dumb
enough
to
walk
in
a
store
and
steal
So
I'm
dumb
enough
to
ask
for
a
date
with
Lauryn
Hill
Some
people
only
see
that
I'm

Cause
I
stand
out

a
green
hat
with
a
orange
bill
But
I
don't
get
pissed,
y'all
don't
even
see
through
the
mist
How
the
fuck
can
I
be
white,
I
don't
even
exist
I
get
a
clean
shave,
bathe,
go
to
a
rave
Die
from
an
overdose
and
dig
myself
up
out
of
my
grave
My
middle
finger
won't
go
down,
how
do
I
wave?
And
this
is
how
I'm
supposed
to
teach
kids
how
to
behave?
Now
follow
me
and
do
exactly
what
you
see
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!
I
slap
women
and
eat
shrooms
then
O.D.
Now
don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!
Me
and
Marcus
Allen
went
over
to
see
Nicole
When
we
heard
a
knock
at
the
door,
must
have
been
Ron
Gold'
Jumped
behind
the
door,
put
the
orgy
on
hold
Killed
em
both
and
smeared
blood
in
a
white
Bronco
(we
did
it!)
My
mind
won't
work
if
my
spine
don't
jerk
I
slapped
Garth
Brooks
out
of
his
Rhinestone
shirt
I'm
not
a
player
just
a
ill
rhyme
sayer
That'll
spray
an
Aerosol
can
up
at
the
ozone
layer
(psssssssh)
My
rap
style's
warped,
I'm
runnin
out
the
morgue
witcha
dead
grandmother's
corpse
to
throw
it
on
your
porch
Jumped
in
a
Chickenhawk
cartoon
wit
a
cape
on
And
beat
up
Foghorn
Leghorn
with
an
acorn
I'm
bout
as
normal
as
Norman
Bates,
with
deformative
traits
A
premature
birth
that
was
four
minutes
late
Mother..
are
you
there?
I
love
you
I
never
meant
to
hit
you
over
the
head
with
that
shovel
Will
someone
explain
to
my
brain
that
I
just
severed
a
main
vein
with
a
chainsaw
and
I'm
in
pain?
I
take
a
breather
and
sighed;
either
I'm
high,
or
I'm
nuts
Cause
if
you
ain't
tiltin
this
room,
neither
am
I
So
when
you
see
your
mom
with
a
thermometer
shoved
in
her
ass
Then
it
probably
is
obvious
I
got
it
on
with
her
Cause
when
I
drop
this
solo
shit
it's
over
with
I
bought
Cage's
tape,
opened
it,
and
dubbed
over
it
I
came
to
the
club
drunk
with
a
fake
ID
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!
I've
been
with
10
women
who
got
HIV
Now
don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!
I
got
genital
warts
and
it
burns
when
I
pee
Don't
you
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!
I
tie
a
rope
around
my
penis
and
jump
from
a
tree
You
probably
wanna
grow
up
to
be
just
like
me!!!
[Eminem]
When
I
was
just
a
little
baby
boy,
my
momma
used
to
tell
me
these
crazy
things
She
used
to
tell
me
my
daddy
was
an
evil
man,
she
used
to
tell
me
he
hated
me
But
then
I
got
a
little
bit
older
and
I
realized,
she
was
the
crazy
one
But
there
was
nothin
I
could
do
or
say
to
try
to
change
it
cause
that's
just
the
way
she
was
They
said
I
can't
rap
about
bein
broke
no
more
They
say
I
can't
rap
about
coke
no
more
(AHHH!)
Slut,

"Oh,

raping
his
own
mother,
abusing
a
whore,
snorting

and

Rolling
Stone
cover?"
You

Got

NO!
Just
criminal
intent

sodomize
women
again
Eminem
offend?
NO!
Eminem
insult
And
if
you
ever
give

to
him,
you
give
him
an
impulse
to
do
it
again,
THEN,
if
he
does
it
again
you'll
probably
end
up
jumpin
out
of

(Ahhhhhhhh!)
Bitch
I'ma

write
a
rhyme,
these
people
think
it's
a
crime
to
tell
em
what's
on
my
mind
-
I
guess
I'm
a
CRIMINAL
but
I
don't
gotta
say
a
word,
I
just
flip
em
the
bird
and
keep
goin,
I
don't
take
shit
from
no
one
[Eminem]
My
mother
did
drugs
-
tar,
liquor,
cigarettes,
and
speed
The
baby
came
out
-
disfigured,
ligaments
indeed
It
was
a
seed
who
would
grow
up
just
as
crazy
as
she
Don't
dare
make
fun
of
that
baby
cause
that
baby
was
me
I'm
a
CRIMINAL
-
an
animal
caged
who
turned
crazed
But
how
the
fuck
you
sposed
to
grow
up
when
you
weren't
raised?
So
as
I
got
older
and
I
got
a
lot
taller
My
dick
shrunk
smaller,
but
my
balls
got
larger
I
drink
malt
liquor
to
fuck
you
up
quicker
than
you'd
wanna
fuck
me
up
for
sayin
the
word
...
My
morals
went
thhbbpp
when
the
president
got
oral
Sex
in
his
Oval
Office
on
top
of
his
desk
Off
of
his
own
employee
Now
don't
ignore
me,
you
won't
avoid
me
You
can't
miss
me,
I'm
white,
blonde-haired
and
my
nose
is
pointy
I'm
the
bad
guy
who
makes
fun
of
people
that
die
in
plane
crashes
and
laughs
As
long
as
it
ain't
happened
to
him
Slim
Shady,
I'm
as
crazy
as
Em
-inem
and
Kim
combined
-
*kch*
the
maniac's
in
Replacin
the
doctor
cause
Dre
couldn't
make
it
today
He's
a
little
under
the
weather,
so
I'm
takin
his
place
(Mm-mm-mmm!)
Oh,
that's
Dre
with
an
AK
to
his
face
Don't
make
me
kill
him
too
and
spray
his
brains
all
over
the
place
I
told
you
Dre,
you
should've
kept
that
thang
put
away
I
guess
that'll
teach
you
not
to
let
me
play
with
it,
eh?
I'm
a
CRIMINAL
[Interlude
Skit]
Aight

motherfuckin

[Eminem]

[Teller]
Okay

[Teller]
What?
Oh

[Eminem]
I'm
not
gonna

you

around...
[Teller]
Don't

don't
kill
me...
[Eminem]
I
said
I'm

gonna
fuckin
kill
you
Hurry

{*BOOM*}
Thank
you!
[Eminem]
Windows
tinted
on
my
ride
when
I
drive
in
it
So
when
I
rob
a
bank,
run
out
and
just
dive
in
it
So
I'll
be
disguised
in
it
And
if
anybody
identifies
the
guy
in
it
I'll
hide
for
five
minutes
Come
back,
shoot
the
eyewitness
Fire
at
the
private
eye
hired
to
pry
in
my
business
Die,
bitches,
bastards,
brats,
pets
This
puppy's
lucky
I
didn't
blast
his
ass
yet
If
I
ever
gave
a
fuck,
I'd
shave
my
nuts
tuck
my
dick
inbetween
my
legs
and
cluck
You
motherfuckin
chickens
ain't
brave
enough
to
say
the
stuff
I
say,
so
this
tape
is
shut
Shit,
half
the
shit
I
say,
I
just
make
it
up
To
make
you
mad
so
kiss
my
white
naked
ass
And
if
it's
not
a
rapper
that
I
make
it
as
I'ma
be
a
fuckin
rapist
in
a
Jason
mask
(Chorus
2X)
(feat.

[Jay-Z:
Verse]
Motherfuckers
say
that
I'm
foolish,
I
only
talk
about
jewels
Do
you
fools
listen
to
music
or
do
you
just
skim
through
it?
See
I'm
influenced
by
the
ghetto
you
ruined
That
same
dude
you
gave
nothing,
I
made
something
doing
What
I
do,
through
and
through
and
I
gave
you
the
news
with
a
twist
it's
just
his
ghetto
point
of
view
The
renegade
you
been
afraid
I
penetrate
pop
culture,
bring
'em
a
lot
closer
to
the
block
where
they
pop
toasters,
and
they
live
with
they
mums
Got
dropped
roasters,
from
botched
robberies
niggas
crotched
over
Mummy's
knocked
up
cause
she
wasn't
watched
over
Knocked
down
by
some
clown
when
child
support
knocked
No
he's
not
around
now
how
that
sound
to
ya,
jot
it
down
I'll
bring
you
through
the
ghetto
without
ridin
round
hiding
down
duckin
strays
from
frustrated
youths
stuck
in
they
ways
Just
read
a
magazine
that
fucked
up
my
day
How
you
rate
music
that
thugs
with
nothing
relate
to
it?
I
help
them
see
they
way
through
it,
not
you.
Can't
step
in
my
pants,
can't
walk
in
my
shoes
Bet
everything
you
worth;
you
lose
your
tie
and
your
shirt.
[Eminem:
Verse]
Since
I'm
in
a
position
to
talk
to
these
kids
and
they
listen
I
ain't
no
politician
but
I'll
kick
it
with
em
a
minute
Cause
see
they
call
me
a
menace
and
if
the
shoe
fits
I'll
wear
it
But
if
it
don't,
then
ya'll
swallow
the
truth
grin
and
bear
it
Now
who's
the
king
of
these
rude
ludicrous
lucrative
lyrics
Who
could
inherit
the
title,
put
the
youth
in
hysterics
Using
his
music
to
steer
it
sharing
his
views
in
his
marriage
But
there's
a
huge
interference
they're
sayin
you
shouldn't
hear
it
Maybe
it's
hatred
I
spew,
maybe
it's
food
for
the
spirit
Maybe
it's
beautiful
music
I
made
for
you
to
just
cherish
But
I'm
debated
disputed
hated
and
viewed
in
America
as
a
motherfuckin
drug
addict
like
you
didn't
experiment?
Now
now,
that's
when
you
start
to
stare
at
who's
in
the
mirror
and
see
yourself
as
a
kid
again,
and
you
get
embarrassed
And
I
got
nothing
to
do
but
make
you
look
stupid
as
parents
You
fuckin
do-gooders
-
too
bad
you
couldn't
DO-GOOD
at
marriage!
And
do
you
have
any
clue
what
I
had
to
do
to
get
here
I
don't
think
you
do
so
stay
tuned
and
keep
your
ears
glued
to
the
stereo
Cause
here
we
go,
he's
{Jigga
durra
Jigga

And
I'm
the
sinister,
Mr.
Kiss-My-Ass
it's
just

I
had
to
hustle,
my
back
to
the
wall,
ashy
knuckles
Pockets
filled
with
a
lot
of
lint,
not
a
cent
Gotta
vent,
lot
of
innocent
of
lives
lost
on
the
project
bench
What
you
hollarin?
Gotta
pay
rent,
bring
dollars
in
By
the
bodega,
iron
under
my
coat,
feelin
braver
Doo-rag
wrappin
my
waves
up,
pockets
full
of
hope
Do
not
step
to
me
I'm
awkward,
I
box
leftier
often
My
pops
left
me
an
orphan,
my
momma
wasn't
home
Could
not
stress
to
me
I
wasn't
growin,
specially
on
nights
I
brought
something
home
to
quiet
the
stomach
rumblings
My
demeanor
thirty
years
my
senior
My
childhood
didn't
mean
much,
only
raisin
greener
Raisin
my
fingers
to
critics
raisin
my
head
to
the
sky
Big
I
did
it
multi(i)
before
I
die
(nigga)
No
lie,
just
know
I
chose
my
own
fate
I
drove
by
the
fork
in
the
road
and
went
straight.

See
I'm
a
poet
to
some,
a
regular
modern
day
Shakespeare
Jesus
Christ
the
King
of
these
Latter

Saints
here
To
shatter
the
picture
in
which
of
that
as
they
paint
me
as
a
mother
of
hate,
Satan
and
scatter-brained
atheist
But
that
ain't
the
case,
see
it's
a
matter
of
taste
We
as
a
people
decide
if
Shady's
as
bad
as
they
say
he
is
Or
is
he
the
ladder,
a
gateway
to
escape?
Media
scapegoat,
they
can
be
mad
at
today
See
it's
as
easy
as
cake,
simple
as
whistling
Dixie
while
I'm
wavin
the
pistol
at
sixty
Christians
against
me
Go
to
war
with
the
Mormons,
take
a
bath
with
the
Catholics
in
holy
water
no
wonder
they
try
to
hold
me
under
longer
I'm
a
motherfuckin
spiteful,
delightful
eyeful
The

Ice
Cube,
motherfuckers
hate
to

What
did
I

(huh)
I'm

Better

Bought

Somebody

(hey,
let

I'm
a
caged
demon,
on

screamin
like
Rage
Against

I'm
convinced
I'm
a

shootin
up
while
this

Clinically
brain
dead,
I
don't
need
a
second

Fuck
droppin
the
jewel,
I'm
flippin
the
sacred
treasure
I'll
bite
your
motherfuckin
style,
just
to
make
it
fresher
I
can't
take
the
pressure,
I'm
sick
of
bitches
Sick
of
naggin
bosses
bitchin
while
I'm
washin
dishes
In
school
I
never
said
much,
too
busy
havin
a
headrush
Doin
too
much
rush
had
my
face
flushed
like
red
blush
Then
I
went
to
Jim
Beam,
that's
when
my
face
grayed
Went
to
gym
in
eighth
grade,
raped
the
women's
swim
team
Don't
take
me
for
a
joke
I'm
no
comedian
Too
many
mental
problems
got
me
snortin
coke
and
smokin
weed
again
I'm
goin
up
over

drivin
on

Finally
made

just
cut

::::EMINEM::::
Nothing
can
stop
and
nothing
can
change
and
you
better
just
make
new
livin'
arrangments
if
you
think,
you
the
top
and
king
of
the
castle
you
about
to
be
thrown
off
the
throne
and
ripped
a
new
asshole
all
I
hear
is
I'm
the
best
at
this
and
I'm
best
at
that
but
I
don't
hear
my
name,
no
??
brought
up
in
rap
and
I
don't
usually
trip
or
damn
get
caught
up
in
that
but
when
they
say
one
of
the
best,
I'm
nowhere
thought
up
as
that
not
even
the
same
leage
as
Jay-Z,
Nas,
Pac,
Biggie
or
maybe
the
name
me
somewhere
down
at
the
bottom,
right
after
AZ
or
say
he
ripped
that
Biggie
verse,
or
that
Jay-Z
yo
his
verses
were
crazy,
on
that
Renegade
beat
but
I
ain't
never
bought
no
whole
CD
of
shady
and
all
I
hear
is
pop
tunes
come
on
the
Radi-O
and
they
play
em
20
times
in
a
row
daily
and
they
very
well
maybe
the
same
reason
they
don't
say
me
when
they
speak
on
hip-hop
legends
which
is
amaze
me
cause
I
thought
the
formula
was
to
hit
mainstream
and
make
it
big
ba
big
big
bay
ba
baby
::::OBIE

So
maybe
the
eighties
made
me
crazy
I've
been
tryin

get
my
weight
up

gave
me
the

(haha)
It's
not
a
big
deal
it's
nothing
but
some
cash
(let's
go)
Who

You
know,
you
acting
like
you
don't

I
tear
the

up
fo'
sho'
This
flow

And

know
but
you
acting
like
you
don't

Who
run

You

When
me
and
Fif
got
together
to
do
this

enveloped
we

fellowship
through

It's
no
pretend

it's
friendship,
me
nemesis

nemesis
Ain't

shit
is
no

is
blood
in
and
blood
out
When
there's
beef
you
jus'
gotta
know
when
to
butt
in
and
butt
out
If
there's
a
problem
we
solve
it,
if
we
don't
resolve
it
It
usually
just
evolves
into
one
big
brawl
and
we
all
get
involved
in
it
We
should
all
get
a
merit,
this
much
beef
we
inherit
And
wear
it
like
a
badge
with
honor,
pass
it
around
and
share
it
And
let
it
go
to
whoever's
holding
the
most
current
beef
on
their
shoulders
And
their
soldiers
got
their
backs
'til
it's
over
But

Cause

And
I

Like

From

If

And

soon
as

But
their
pride
won't
let

inside's

'Go

And

I

And

haha,
Nate
Dogg
[deep
breathing]
In
my
mind
I'm
a
fighter,
my
heart's
a
lighter
My
soul
is
the
fluid,
my
flow
sparks
it
right
up
An
arsenic
writer,
author
with
arth-r-itis
Carpel-tunnel,
Marshall
with
start
shit-itis
Hard-headed
and
hot-headed
Bull-headed
and
pig-headed
Dick-headed,
a
prick,
a
big
headache,
I'm
sick
Quick-witted
for
every
lyric
spitted
There
are
six
critics
who
wait
for
me
to
slip
with
it
So
quick,
this
dynamite
stick,
bury
the
wick
It's
gonna
explode
any
minute
Some
lunatic
lit
it,
and
it's
not
Nelly
Do
not
tell
me
to
stop
yelling
When
I
stop
selling
I'll
quit,
so
stop
dwelling!
I
am
not
failing,
you
fuckers
are
not
ready
Cause
I
got
jelly,
like
Beyonce's
pot
belly
This
is
destiny;
yes,
money,
I'm
off
running
So
get
off
of
me,
I'm
not
slowing
or
softening
No
apologies!
Nah,
suckers,
I'm
not
sorry
You
can
all
sue
me,
y'all
could
be
the
cause
of
me
No
apologies!
Y'all
feeling
the
force
of
me
No
remorse
for
me,
like
there
was
no
recourse
for
me
No
apologies!
Not
even
acknowledging
you
at
all
'Til
I
get
a
call
that
God's
coming
No
apologies!
Laugh,
fuckers,
it's
all
funny
I
can
spit
in
your
face
while
you're
standing
across
from
me
No
apologies!
My
head
hits
the
pillow,
a
weeping
willow
I
can't
sleep,
a
pain
so
deep
it
bellows
But
these
cellos
help
just
to
keep
me
mellow
Hands
on
my
head,
touch
knees
to
elbows
I'm
hunched
over,
emotion
just
flows
over
These
cold
shoulders
are
both
frozen
You
don't
know
me
I
keep
saying
it,
I
can't
stress
it
enough
So
keep
playing
it,
and
stand
next
to
the
subs
I
choke
mics
like
asphyxiation
When
I'm
strangling
my
own
throat
masturbatin'
Fuck
yeah,
I'm
a
basket
case,
and
I
master
this
rap
shit
'til
my
ass
gets
wasted
'Til
my
assassination
'Til
I'm
slain
because
of
some
fag's
infatuation
.44
mag's
fascination
A
taste
for
disaster,
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
No
apologies!
Nah,
suckers,
I'm
not
sorry
You
can
all
sue
me,
y'all
could
be
the
cause
of
me
No
apologies!
Y'all
feeling
the
force
of
me
No
remorse
for
me,
like
there
was
no
recourse
for
me
No

Not
even
acknowledging
you
at

'Til
I
get

No

Laugh,
fuckers,
it's

I
can
spit
in
your
face
while
you're
standing
across
from
me
No

This
song
isn't
for
you,
it's
for
me:
a
true
MC
It's
what
he'll
do
just
to
see
if
he
still
has
it
And
if
his
skills
mastered
He's
able
to
spill
raps
long
after
he's
killed
That's
a
real
MC,
got
you
feelin'
me
Whether
willing
or
unwillingly,
you
still
agree
As
long
as
there's
still
this
hunger
and
will
in
me
Then
expect
a
longer
life
expectancy
I'd
be
a
savage
beast,
if
I
ain't
had
this
outlet
to
salvage
me
Inside
I'd
be
exploding,
soaked
in
self-loathing
And
mourning,
so
I'm
warning
you
don't
coax
me
It's
silly,
I'm
really
a
sheep
in
wolf's
clothing
Who
only
reacts
when
he
gets
pushed,
don't
be
Fooled,
the
press
blows
up
this
whole
thing
It's
stupid,
they
don't
know,
cause
they
don't
see
That
I'm
wounded,
all
they
did
was
ballooned
it
I'm
sick
of
talkin'
about
these
tattoos
Cartoon
did
That's
why
I
tuned
it
out,
I'm
sick
of
dukin'
They
can
suck
my
dick
while
I'm
pukin'
And
you
too,
you
can
Expect
no
sympathy
from
me
I'm
an
MC,
this
is
how
I'm
supposed
to
be
Cold
as
a
G,
my
heart's
frozen
It
don't
even
beat,
so
expect
no
apologies
Expect
no
sympathy
from
me
I'm
an
MC,
this
is
how
I'm
supposed
to
be
Cold
as
a
G,
my
heart's
frozen
It
don't
even
beat,
so
expect
no
apologies
[Dr.
West:]
Morning,
Marshall.
[Eminem:]
Morning,
doc.
[Dr.
West:]
So
we're
discharging
you
today,
how
are
you
feeling?
[Eminem:]
Anxious.
[Dr.
West:]
Anxiety?
[Eminem:]
Well,
anxious
to
get
home,
anxious
to
get
back
into
the
world.
Nervous.
[Dr.
West:]
Nervous?
C'mon,
Marshall,
you're
a
big
boy
now.
Sounding
like
a
bit
of
a
baby,
you
can
do
this.
You
found
a
sponsor
yet?
[Eminem:]
Um,
not
yet.
I
mean,
but
when
I
get
back
[Dr.
West:]
Well,
if
you
find
one,
you
find
one.
If
you
don't,
you
don't.
[Eminem:]
Well,
yeah,
I
mean
I
godda
start
going
to
meetings
first
and...
Wait,
what?
[Dr.
West:]
Well,
you
don't
absolutely
have
to
go
to
meetings
and
it's
not
like
like
a
requirement
that
they
fit
into
your
shedule,
we
know
you're
a
busy
person.
[Eminem:]
But
I
thought
variety
was
the
most
important
thing?
[Dr.
West:]
So
what
else
are
you
thinking?
[Eminem:]
Um,
well,
I
know
I
godda
start
practising
the
steps,
and
I
mean
learning
them,
and
start
being
able
to
apply
them.
[Dr.
West:]
Steps?
[Eminem:]
Yeah,
steps.
[Dr.
West:]
There's
a
lot
of
them,
aren't
there?
[Eminem:]
Well,
twelve.
[Dr.
West:]
Christ,
I
don't
even
know
them
all.
[Eminem:]
Really?
[Dr.
West:]
Anything
else?
[Eminem:]
Um,
well,
I
mean
the
only
other
question
I
have
was
like,
what
do
I
do
if
I
find
myself
in
a
situation
where
maybe
somebody
is
drinking
around
me
or
something
like
that
and
I
get
tempted
to?
[Dr.
West:]
Take
a
drink.
[Eminem:]
What?
[Dr.
West:]
Take
a
drink
and
y'know,
take
the
edge
off.
[Eminem:]
Take
the
edge
off?
Man,
if
I
ever
take
a
drink
I
already
know
what
that's
gonna
lead
me
to.
[Dr.
West:]
What,
you
mean
these?
*shakes
pills*
[Eminem:]
Man,
what
the
fuck!?
[Dr.
West:]
Marhsall,
what's
the
matter,
darling?
Having
some
doubts
already?
Marshall,
you
can't
leave
me,
you'll
never
leave
me,
Marshall.
We'll
always
be
together,
Marshall.
Marshall?...
Marshall!?
[Eminem:]
No,
no,
no,
no,
NO!

While

Here
I

Contemplading

Lick

And

Wake

Dead

Behind

Sitting

It's

I
wonder
what's
on
the

Maybe
they'll
show
some
boobs
Surfing
every
channel
Until
I
find
hannah

Then
I
reach
for
the
aloe
and
lanalin
Bust
all
over
the

panel
and
dismantlin
Every
candle
on
top
of
the

Mantalin
Grab
my
flannel
and
my

then
Kiss
the
naked
manakin
man
again
You
can
see
him
standin
in
my
Front
window
If
you
look

I'm

a
hooligan
Who's
use
to

Causin
illusions

Brain
contusions

Cutting

bruising
the
skin
Raise
the
scissors
and

Jesus
when
does
it
end
Phases
that
I
go
through
Dazed
and
I'm
so
confused
Days
that
I
don't
know
who
Gave
these
molecules
too
Me
What

Had

The

Very

lotion
in
the
bucket
He
puts
the
lotion
on
the
skin
Or
else
it
gets
the
hose
again
I
duck
and
I
slash
slice
and
gash
Last
night
was
a
blast
I
can't
quite
remember
when
I
Had
that
much
fun
Off
a
half
pint
of
the
jack
My
last
vic
and
a
half
A
flashlight
Up
kim
kardashians
ass
I
remember
the
first
time
I
dismembered
a
family
member
December
I
think
it
was
I
was
having
drinks
with
my
cuz
And
I
wrapped
him
In
christmas
lights
Pushed
him
into
the
stinkin
tub
Cut
him
up
into
pieces
Then
just
when
I
went
to
drink
his
Blood
I
thought
I
outta
drink
this
bath
water
That
outta
be
fun
That's
when
my
days
of
serial
murder
man
slaughter
begun
The
sight
of
blood
excites
me
That
might
be
an
artery
son
Your
blood
curdling
screams
Just
don't
seem
to
bother
me
none
It's
3
am
And
here
I
come
So
you
should
probably
run
A
secret
passage
way
around
here
Man
there's
got
to
be
one
Oh
no
there's
probably
none
He
can
scream
all
that
he
wants
Top
of
his
lungs
It
aint
no
stoppin
me
from
choppin
him
up(up)
(Chorus)
Cause
it's
3
a.m
in
the
mornin
Put
my
key
in
the
door
and
Bodies
layin
all
of
the
floor
and
I
don't
remember
how
they
got
there
but
I
guess
I
must
of
killed
em
Killed

I
said
It's

in
the

Put
my
key
in

and
Bodies

and

[Verse

My
mom,
my
mom,
I
know
your
probably
tired
of
hearing
'bout
my
mom,
Oooh
whooa
But
this
is
just
a
story
of
when
I
was
just
a
shorty
And
how
I
become
hooked
on
vah-a-l-ium
Valium
was
in
everything,
food
that
I
ate
The
water
that
I
drank,
fuckin
peas
in
my
plate
She
sprinkled
just
enough
of
it
just
to
season
my
steak
So
everyday
I'd
have
at
least
three
stomach
aches
Now
tell
me,
what
kind
of
mother
would
want
to
see
her
Son
to
grow
up
to
be
an
under-afuckin-chiever
My
teacher
didn't
think
I
was
gunna
be
nothin
either
"What
the
fuck

stickin
gum
up
under
the
fuckin
seat
for?
"
"Mrs.
Mathers
your
son
has
been
huffin
ether,
"
"Either
that
or
the
motherfuckers
been
puffin'
reefer"
But
all
this
huffin
and
puffin
wasn't
what
it
was
either,
it
was
neither
I
was
buzzin
but
it
wasn't
what
she
thought
Pee

Bitch

keeper
I'm

What

for
Slut

Go

white
crayon
and

[Chorus:]
My

drugs
That's
why
I
am
like
I
am
cause
I'm
like
her
Because
My
mom
love
valium
and
lots
of
drugs
That's
why
I'm
on
what
I'm

cause
I'm
My
Mom!
[Verse
2:]
Wait
a
minute...
This
ain't
dinner,
this
is
paint
thinner
"You
ate
it
yesterday,
I
ain't
hear
no
complaints
did
I?
Now
heres
a
plate
full
of
pain
killers,
now
just
wait
till
I
crush
the
valium
And
put
it
in
your
potatoes,
you
little
motherfucker,
I'll
make
you
sit
there
and
make
that
retarded
fuckin
face
Without
even
tastin
it.
You
better
lick
that
fuckin'
plate
you
ain't
wastin'
it,
put
your
face
in
it
'Fore
I
throw
you
in
the
basement
again,
and
I
ain't
givin'
in
Your
gunna
just
sit
there
in
one
fuckin
place
spi?
Till
next
Thanksgiving
and
if
you
still
ain't
finished
Then
I'll
use
the
same
shit
again,
then
When
I
make
spinach
dip
It'll
be
placed
in
the
shit.
You
little
shit
Wanna
sit
there
and
play
innocent
A
rack
filler
hit
me
in
K-Mart
and
they
witnessed
it
Child
support?
Your
father
he
ain't
sent
the
shit
And
so
what
if
he
did?
It's
none
of
your
dang
business
kid"
[Bridge
1:]
My
mom,
there's
no
one
else
quite
like
my
mom
I
know
I
should
let
bygones
be
bygones
But
shes
the
reason
why
I
am
high
what
I'm
high
on
[Chorus:]
My
mom
loves
valium
and
lots
of
drugs
That's
why
I
am
like
I
am
cause
I'm
like
her
Because
My
mom
loves
valium
and
lots
of
drugs
That's
why
I'm
on
what
I'm
on
cause
I'm
My
Mom!
[Bridge
2:]
My
mom
loves
valium
now
while
I
am
There's
a
party
animal,
I
am
what
I
am
But
I'm
strong
to
the
finish
with
me
valium
spinach
But
my
buzz
only
last
about
two
minutes
But
I
don't
wanna
swallow
it
without
chewin'
it
I
can't
even
write
a
rhyme
without
doin'
it
My
valium,
My
valiiiuuuuum
[Verse
3:]
Man
I
never
thought
I
could
never
be
a
drug
addict
Nah
fuck
that,
I
can't
have
it
happen
to
me
But
that
actually
what
has
ended
up
happenin'
A
tradegy,
of
fuckin
passin
it
up,
catchin'
me
And
it's
probably
where
I
got
aquanted
with
the
taste,
Ain't
it
Pharmaceuticals
are
the
bomb
mom,
beautiful
She
killed
a
fuckin
dog
with
the
medicine
she
done
fed
it
Feed
a
fuckin
asprin
and
say
that
it
has
a
headache
"Here
want
a
snack,
you
hungry
you
fuckin
brat?
"
"Look
at
that,
it's
a
xanax,
take
it
and
take
a
nap!
EAT
IT!
"
But
I
DONT
NEED
IT!
"WELL
FUCK
IT,
then
break
it
up!
"
"Take
a
little
piece
then
beat
it,
before
you
wake
Nathan
up!
"
Alright
ma,
you
win,
I
don't
feel
like
arguin'
I'll
do
it,
pop
it
gobble
it,
and
start
wobblin'
Stumble,
hobble,
tumble,
slip,
tripped
and
I
fall
in
bed
With
a
bottle
of
Meds,
and
a
Heath
Ledger

[Verse
1:]
I
was
born
with
a
dick
in
my
brain
Yea
fucked
in
the
head
My
step-father
said
that
I
sucked
in
the
bed
'Til
one
night
he
snuck
in
and
said
We're
going
out
back,
I
want
my
dick
sucked
in
the
shed
"Can't
we
just
play
with
Teddy
Ruxpin
instead?
"
After
I
fuck
you
in
the
butt,
get
some
head
Bust
a
nut,
get
some
rest
The
next
day
my
mother
said,
"I
don't
know
what
the
fuck's
up
with
this
kid"
The
bastard
won't
even
eat
nothing
he
scared
He
just
hung
himself
in
the
bedroom
he's
dead
Terry
don't
let
that
fucker
get
you
upset
Go
in
there
stick
a
fucking
cigarette
to
his
neck
I
bet
you
he's
faking
it
I
bet
you,
I'll
bet
he
prolly
wants
to
see
how
upset
you
would
get
I'll
go
handle
this
of
course
unless
you
object
Ah,
go
fuck
his
brains
out
if
any
is
left
in
his
head
[Chorus:]
If
you
could
count
the
skeletons
in
my
closet
Under
my
bed
and
up
under
my
faucet
Then
you
would
know
I've
completely
lost
it
Is
he
nuts?
No,
he's
insane
If
you
could
count
the
skeletons
in
my
closet
Under
my
bed
and
up
under
my
faucet
Then
you
would
know
I've
completely
lost
it
Is
he
nuts?
No,
he's
insane
[Verse
2:]
You
get
it?
No
I
just
tried
to
bite
my
face
off
I
just
got
fucking
chased
off
with
a
chainsaw
Then
he
took
the
chainsaw
bit
the
fucking
blades
off
Ate
the
blades,
stuck
a
baseball
in
a
slingshot
Then
he
aimed
at
his
own
face
let
the
thing
pop
Took
his
eye
out
picked
it
up
and
played
ping
pong
Then
he
played
ping
pong
with
his
own
ding
dong
That
motherfucker's
got
nuts
like
king
kong
Then
he
set
the
lawn
mower
out
on
the
dang
lawn
And
he
layed
all
up
underneath
it
with
the
thing
on
Then
he
took
his
pants
he
took
every
fucking
thing
off
Everything
except
his
tank
top
and
his
training
bra
Ain't
he
raw?
Yea,
maniac
that
Shady
dog
Man
that
motherfuckers
gangsta,
ain't
he
dog?
Shady
dog,
what
be
going
through
that
fucking
brain
of
yours?
Say
no
more,
what
the
fuck
you
waiting
for?
Sing
along.
[Chorus]
[Verse
3:]
Don't
you
know
what
felch
means?
(Yea)
Well
then
tell
me,
would
you
rather
get
felched
or
do
the
felching?
Fuck
'em
in
the
ass
suck
the
cum
out
while
you're
belching
Burp
belch
and
go
back
for
a
second
helping
Can
you
dig
what
I'm
saying
man?
can
you
smell
me?
I
want
you
to
feel
me
like
my
step-father
felt
me
Fuck
a
little
puppet
kick
the
puppy
while
he's
yelping
Shady
what
the
fuck
you
saying?
I
don't
know
help
me!
What
the
fuck's
happening?
I
think
I'm
fucking
melting!
Marshall
I
just
love
you
boy
I
care
about
your
well-being
No

I
said
no,
I
don't
need
no
help
peeing
I'm
a
big
boy
I
can
do
it
by
myself
see
I
only
get
naked
when
the
babysitter
tells
me
She
showed
me
a
movie
like
Nightmare
on
Elm
Street
But
actually
it
was
called
The
Pubic
Hair
on
Chelsie
Well

called
Ass-Rape
and
we
should
do
the
Jail
scene

Oh,

Oh

Ok,

When

Wow

Ceuticals

Pull

Baby

You
see
that
chick
in
the
gym
checking
me
out?
Any
second
I'm
bout
to
stick
her
neck
in
my
mouth
I
lose
a
pill
and
I'm
wrecklessly
wrecking
the
house
That
was
suppose
to
be
breakfast,
where
the
heck
is
it
now?
Here's
the
necklace
I
lost,
right
next
to
Stephanie's
blouse
Man
I
should
check
to
see
if
my
mom
left
any
out
Nope,
guess
I'll
re-route
Maybe
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
couch
Oh!
Jackpot!
Yea,
'Open

mouth
Down
the
hatchet,
the
feeling,
you
can't
match
it
A
rap-tap-tap
on
your
door
with
the
damn
ratchet
A
tat-tac-tac
in
the
hall
with
the
damn
hatchet
A
nap-sack-packed
with
like
40-some
Zan-exs
Shorty
come
back,
I'm
tryin
to
score
me
some
lapdances
I'm
bout
to
relapse
so
maybe
pour
me
some
Jack
Daniels
Formula
40-40
and
40s
with
mad
capsules
The
bad
apple
spoils
the
bunch
and
back
at-ya
[Chorus
1:]
Well
I
don't
mean
any
harm
all
I
wanted
to
do
is
just
say
Hello
And
are
you
menstruating
baby,
my
lil
friend's
waiting
to
say
Hello
The
way
your
titties
are
wiggling
and
your
booty
shakin
like
Jello
Girl
I
don't
mean
any
harm
all
I
wanted
to
do
is
just
say
Hello
[Verse
2:]
My
equilibrium
is
off,
must
be
the
Lithium
I
don't
need
to
buy
any
drugs,
man
people
give
me
'em
It
just
becomes
everyday
extracurriculum
No
reason
in
particular,
it
was
strictly
fun
A
fifth
of
rum
and
two
bottles
of
151
51
people
asleep
in
my
damn
living
room
Scuse
me
hun?
But
what
is
your
name,
Vivian?
I
woke
up
next
to
ya
naked
and
uh,
did
we
umm?
Of
course
we
did,
but
didn't
I
strap
Jimmy
on?
I'm
looking
for
the
torn
wrapper
but
there
don't
seem
to
be
one
No
offense
baby
girl
I
don't
mean
any
harm
But
disease
is
something
I'm
trying
to
keep
my
penis
free
from
I
find
the
fact
that
you,
I'm
cool,
I
immediately
run
like
Speedy
Gon-
Zalez
to
see
if
I
see
anyone
Who
might
have
a
couple
of
threes,
I'm
fiending
for
some
My
head
is
pounding
to
the
beat
of
the
drum
[Chorus
2:]
Well
I
don't
mean
any
harm
all
I
wanted
to
do
is
just
say
Hello
And
do
you
happen
to
have
anything
on
you
that
make
my
mood
mellow?
Some
are
opal
and
some
are
pink,
some
are
blue
and
some
are
just
yellow
Girl
I
don't
mean
any
harm
all
I
wanted
to
do
is
just
say
Hello
[Verse
3:]
Oh,
those
were
the
days,
they
certainly
were
It's
hurtin
me
to
know
that
I'll
be
closing
that
curtain
for
good
(Word-word,
chi-word-word,
chi-word-chi-chi-word)
I
second
that
and
a
third,
rush
to
emergency
sur-
-gery
to
try
to
flush
me
because
of
the
drugs
that
he
purged
He's
no
longer
getting
the
three-hundred
bucks
for
these
Perc-odans
Buster's
getting
to
be
where
he
lustfully
surged
it
in
Pain
it
hitting
his
knee
and
his
muscles
'be
hurtin
him'
Childishly
on
the
phone
tryin
to
rustle
up
muscle
relax-
-ers
for
his
back
and
a
couple
of
packs
Since
now
he's
doubling
back-wards
and
he
stumblin
back
Slipped
and
fell,
hit
his
back-bone,
heard
something
go
crack
Now
he's
up
in
the
bathroom
like
he's
busting
a
nap
Almost
ended
it
that
soon
because
of
the
fact
I'm
just
busting
my
own
chops
while
I'm
bustin
a
rap
Resuscitated
and
re-juiced
so
fuck
it,
I'm
back
[Chorus
2]
And
so
I'm
sayin...
[Outro:]
Hello

In

[Verse

The
first
victim
I
had,
she
was
a
big
one
Big
movie
star,
a
party
girl,
big
fun
She
was
the
girl
the
media
always
picked
on
In
and
out
of
rehab,
every
4
to
6
months
She
was
always
known
for
little
pranks
and
slick
stunts
And
Nickelodeon
flashed
her
little
kids
once
What
an
event
it
was,
I
was
sitting
in
front
I
was
hooked
in
it
the
first
glimpse
of
them
buns
Seen
her
back
stage

where
I

Look

Hello

How

Girl
I'm

me
start
over

See

I
meant

little
intervention
Come
with
me
to
Brighton,
let
me
relieve
your
tension
You
little
Wench
ya,
murder
wasn't
my
intention
If
I

would
of

been
done
Slowly
she
gets
in
and
I
begin
to
lynch
her
With
sixty-six
inches
of
extension...
cord.
[Hook:]
Yeah

[Verse

My
second
victim
was
even
bigger
then
the
first
Pop
star,
icon,
the
whole
works
She
played
a
little
schoolgirl
when
she
first
burst
Upon
the
scene
and
seen
that
the
world
was
hers
She
twirls
and
turns
and
flirts
in
skirts
so
bad
it
hurts
It
irked
me
and
made
me
mad
at
first
I
lashed
out
through
my
songs
but
what
was
really
going
on
Was
that
I
had
developed
a
crush
I
just
didn't
know
how
to
tell
it
to
her...
Should
I
cut
off
one
of
my
ears
and
mail
it
to
her?
Send
her
pictures
of
my
collections
of
skeletons
Of,
footage
of
me
impaling
myself
on
an
elephant
tusk?
We'll
settle
this
once
and
for
all,
I'm
a
tell
her
at
dusk
Tonight,

is

night
and

Creep

Climb

and
ring
the
bell

And

She

On

Squeeze

bisexually
wreck
ya
Hannibal
Lecter
into
guy
sex
and
I
bet
ya
I
tantalize
ya
in
and
less
than
5
seconds
I
get
ya
They
say
once
bitten
and
twice
shy
Well
I'm
next
to
the
guy
with
9
extacy
pills
and
5
extra
Boxes
of
ripped
condoms
and
quantities
why
yessir
I
took
the
rest
of
the
lunesta
pills
from
my
dresser
It's
my
kind
of
vibe,
what
else
should
I
try
Lester?
Drop
kick
the
bitch
before
her
second
trimester
Perform
a
home
abortion
with
Dexter
then
I
guess
I
Dig
the
fetus
out
with
the
wire
hanging
and
digest
her
[Chorus:]
I
guess
it's
time
for
you
to
hate
me
again
Let's
begin,
now
hand
me
the
pen
How
should
I
begin
it
and
where
does
it
all
end?
The
world
is
just
my
medicine
ball,
you're
all
in
(I
said)
I
guess
it's
time
for
you
to
hate
me
again
Let's
begin,
now
hand
me
the
pen
How
should
I
begin
it
and
where
does
it
all
end?
My
medicine
ball,
you're
in
my
medicine
ball
friends
[Verse
2:]
All
my
westside
bitches
throw
it
up
Put
a
balloon
inside
your
pussy,
queef,
and
blow
it
up
Man
I
think
that
he
just
fell
up
the
teat
and
shown
enough
So
you
better
change
the
station
and
keep
them
throwin
up
Man
you
seen
it
all
before,
you
are
too
familiar
with
it
There's
a
penis
on
floor
and
two
balls,
so
you
know
who
did
it?
You
know
you
with
it
girl,
don't
front,
oh
no
you
didn't
I
won't
rape
all
The
Pussy
Cat
Dolls'
and
then
call
you
Kitten
Now
I'll
pee
on
Rhianna,
see
man
I
do
what
I
wanna
Spray
perfume
in
her
sauna
room,
Krazy
Gluing
Madonna
To
the
Lay-Z-Boy
sofa,
fold
her
in
two,
then
sit
on
her
Imagine
the
visual
for
that
man,
who
would've
thought
I
Could
ever
be
such
a
relentless
prick
Unleashin
his
vengance
for
the
chick
So
old
she
looks
like
she
outlived
her
life
sentence
I
never
ment
this
rhyme
to
be
so
offensive
If
you
weren't
so
defensive
it
wouldn't
be,
you're
so
sensitive
[Chorus]
[Verse
3:]
Put
Christopher
Reeves
on
a
unicycle
with
a
kickstand
Kick
it
up
and
push
him
and
lead
him
right
into
quicksand
Here
you
need
a
hand
big
man?
grab
hold
of
this
branch
With
both
hands
but
they
don't
understand
I'm
just
a
sick
man
Now
everybody's
pissed
at
me
Like
it's
my
fault
his
name
rhymes
with
so
many
different
words
geez
So
one
last
time,
Mr.
Christopher
Reeves
Won't
you
brake
it
down
for
me
and
just
spit
the
verse
please?
Eminem
I'm
coming
to
kill
you
(sniff)
I've
always
hated
you
and
I
still
do
You'll
never
fill
my
shoes,
my
superman
costume
(sniff)
Doesn't
even
fit
you,
they
don't
feel
you
You're
taking
this
shit
too
far
(sniff)
Who
do
you
think
you
are?
In
my
suit
up
in
the
armoire
Everyday
I
hate
you
more
and
more,
throw
down
the
carboard
Let's
breakdance
if
you
think
you're
hardcore
[Chorus]
The
world
is
mine!
Hey,
what's
going
on,
this
is
Paul
Rosenberg,
attorney
of
law.
Listen,
I
listened
to
the
rough
copy
of
your
album
And
uh,
you
know
I've
just
got
to
be
honest
with
you
Can
you
tone
it
down
a
little
bit?
Because
there's
only
so
much
I
can
explain.
Give
me
a
call
[Intro:]
Yep
Follow
me
(Follow
me)
Come
with
me
to
the
dark
side
of
the
force
(force)
No
man
would
vote
for
your
to
this
place
The
devil
only
knows
of
this
world
So
dark
and
oh
so
cold,
it's
oh
so
cold,
oh
so
cold,
oh
[Chorus:]
Soon
as
my
flow
starts
I
compose
art
like
the
ghost
of
Mozart
Even
though
they
all
say
that
they're
real
I
know
that
most
aren't
Boy
you
think
you're
clever
don't
ya
girl
you
think
your
so
smart
Come
with
me
to
another
side
in
a
world
so
cold
and
so
dark
(Stay
wide
awake)
A
world
so
cold,
a
world
where
on-ly
some
will
go
(Stay
wide
awake)
But
not
return,
when
will
they
learn?
Where
do
they
go?
God
only
knows
(Stay
wide
awake)
[Verse
1:]
3-5-4-4
I
think
I
smell
the
scent
of
a
placenta
I
enter
Central
Park
it's
dark,
it's
winter
in
December
I
see
my
target,
whip
my
car
in
Park
and
approach
her
tender
Young
girl
by
the
name
of
Brenda
and
I
pretend
to
befriend
her
Sit
down
beside
her
like
a
spider,
Hi
there
girl
you
mighta
Heard
of
me
before
see
whore
you're
the
kinda
girl
that
I'd
a-
-ssault
and
rape
and
figure
why
not
try
to
make
your
pussy
widea
Fuck
you
with
an
umbrella
and
then
open
it
up
while
the
shits
inside
ya
I'm
the
kinda
guy
that's
mild
but
I
might
flip
and
get
a
little
bit
wilda
Impregnate
a
lesbian,
yea
now
let's
see
ya
have
triplets
and
I'll
di-
-sintegrate
them
babies,
as
soon
as
they
out
hoe,
with
formalde-
-hyde
in
cyanide
girl,
you
can
try
and
hide,
you
can
try
to
scream
louda
No
need
for
no
gun
powder
that
only
takes
all
the
fun
out
of
Mur-derin
I'd
rather
go
'vrinn-vrinn'
and
now
you
see
just
how
the
Fuck
I
do
just
what
I
do
when
I
cut
right
through
your
scalpa
Shit
wait
a
minute,
I
mean
skull
my
knife
seems
dull
Pull
another
one
out
uhhh
[Chorus]
[Verse
2:]
So
dark
and
so
cold,
my
friends
don't
know
this
other
side
of
me
There's
a
monster
inside
of
me,
it's
quite
ugly
and
it
fright-uns
me
But
they
can't
see
what
I
can
see,
there's
a
vacancy
in
my
tum-my
It's
makin
me
play
hide-n-seek,
like
Jason
I'm
so
hun-gry
She's
naked
see
no
privacy
but
I
can
see
she
wants
me
So
patient
see
I
try
to
be
but
gee
why
does
she
taunt
me?
Pulls
the
drapes
and
she
goes
right
to
sleep
And
I
creep
right
through
the
front
seat
So
blatently
but
silently
cause
I
know
that
she's
sound
asleep
Who's
waking
me
so
violently
and
why's
he
on
top
of
me?
He's
rapin
me,
she
tries
to
scream,
somebody
please
get
him
off
me
He's
tapin
me,
he's
bitin
me,
he's
laughin
likes
it's
funny
She's
scrapin
me,
she's
fightin
me,
she's
scratching
like
some
dumb
freak
Escapin
me,
'No
Dice'
you'll
see,
I
might
just
be
Ted
Bundy
Or
Satan
gee,
what
a
site
to
see,
I'm
dancing
in
my
red
panties
I'm
crazy
but
it's
alright
with
me,
man,
life
can
be
so
empty
Stay
away
from
me
cause
I'm
dancin
to
quite
a
different
drum
beat
[Chorus]
[Verse
3:]
But
I'd
tried
to
stay
wide
awake
Cause
you
might
be
found
dead
by
the
lake
Soon
as
you
lay
me
down
to
sleep,
bitch's
soul
I'm
a
try
to
take
Pray
for
light
today
right
away,
why
do
they
try
to
fight
today?
I
must
make
them
pay
twice
as
much,
might
as
well
put
the
knife
away
Now
I
use
power
tools,
how
bout
now
while
you
in
the
shower?
Scour
you
for
6
hours
'til
outage
of
power
outlets
How
did
ya
figure
out
I
was
down
in
your
basement?
Now
ya
Must
of
just
heard
the
sound
of
my
stomach
growlin
from
down
there
I'll
bet
there's
no
one
fouler,
bound
ya,
that's
how
they
found
ya
Face
down
in
the
tub,
I
drown
you
with
piles
of
downers
around
ya
Such
nostalgia
and
powers,
such
prowess,
look
how
you
cower
Jumped
out
on
you
now
like
I
was
a
Jawa
from
fuckin
Star
Wars
Jabba
the
Hutt
be
de
ba
ba,
be
de
ba
ba
it's
time
to
da
da
Ought
to
not
even
botha
to
scream,
it
don't
even
matta
Amazing
when
raising
skin
with
these
razor
blades
he
waves
at
ya
Not
your
everyday
game,
he
invade
me
in
holy
water
Nothin
like
somethin
to
say,
so
please
understand
there's
no
gun-in-hand
Where's
the
thrill
in
a
hunt?
there's
no
fun
in
that,
here
I
come
with
axe
Once
I
act
like
lumberjack
when
I'm
hackin
him
up
with
that
What
was
that?
dial
911
someone's
comin
in
from
the
back
[Chorus]
(feat.
Dr.
Dre)
[Intro:
Eminem]
Good
evening!
This
is
your
fuckin'
captain
speaking!
We
will
soon
be
reaching
an
altitude
of...
4
million
and
a
half
feet
That's
8
million
miles
in
the
sky!
Please!
Undo
your
seat
belt
for
take
off
You
are
now
free
to
smoke
about
the
cabin.
Tik-it!
[Verse
1:]
[Dr.
Dre:]
I'm
Dre
from
-
back
in
the
day
from
N.W.A
from
-
back
in
the
grave
from
Chokin'
a
bitch
to
-
smacking
her
face
from
Stacking
up
bodies
to
-
blacken
they
case
up
from.
Racking
up
hits
to
-
stacking
them
crates
up.
I'm
still
hungry
and
I'm
back
with
a
tapeworm!
And
we
was
happening
and
rap
entertainment,
Me
and
shady
for
us
competition,
faggot
there
ain't
none!
(EM:
yeah!)
[Eminem:]
Speak
of
the
devil,
it's
the
attack
of
the
rain
man,
Chainsaw
in
hand
bloodstain
on
my
apron.
Soon
as
the
blades
spun
vrun
they
run
away
from,
Who
want
to
play
dungeon
no
one
is
safe
from!
In
search
of
a
brain
surgeon
the
great
one,
Wait
it
ain't
funny
man
it's
urgent
I
need
one.
Two
boxes
of
detergent
and
a
paintgun,
And
a
emergency
squirtgun
to
spray
everyone.
[Chorus:
Eminem]
So
one
more
time
for
old
time's
sake!
[scratches]
Dre
drop
that
beat!
-
And
scratch
that
break!
Now
just
blow
a
little
bit
of
that
smoke
my
way
And
let's
go!
(Tik-it!
We're
now
smoking
with
the
best,
the
best!
Tik-it!)
I
said
one
more
time
for
old
time's
sake
[scratches]
Dre
drop
that
beat!
-
And
scratch
that
break!
Now
just
send
a
little
bit
of
that
smoke
my
way
And
let's
go!
(Tik-it!
we're
now
smoking
with
the
best,
the
best!
Tik-it!)
[Verse
2:]
[Eminem:]
Smoke
signal
in
the
sky
like
Verizon
wireless
A
nice
environment!
Surprised,
entirely
hypnotized
by
the
sound,
I
surround
the
hydrants
Taking
lives
of
firemen
Say
goodbye,
here
I
am
again.
-
Naked
wives
and
Vicodin,
Before
I
begin
to
get
so
high,
pussy
boy
I
could
spin.
Vin-vin!
-
Fuck
the
handle!
I
fly
off
the
hinge!
Let
the
boy
off
the
bench
coach
and
throw
it
to
him.
There
he
goes
in
his
trench
coat
and
them
clothes
again,
Baby
make
us
some
french
toast
and
show
us
some
skin.
I'll
show
you
every
inch
girls
of
my
foreskin,
Show
me
nipple,
I
pinch
both
and
throw
up
a
ten.
Now
you
know
it's
a
sin
to
tease
blow
us
again
The
sorcerer
of
intercourse
if
it's
forced
it's
him.
"Don't
fight
the
feeling
if
you're
feeling
the
force
within
When
you
wake
in
the
morning
next
to
the
porcelain!
"
[Chorus]
[Verse
3:]
[Dr.
Dre:]
Now
where
there's
smoke
there's
fire
-
where
there's
fire
there's
flames
Where
there's
flames
there's
chronic
-
either
you
high
or
you
ain't.
I
got
no
time
for
no
games.
(Eminem:
Nah-ah
he
ain't
playing!)
[Eminem:]
He's
gonna
get
the
AK
and
aim
it
right
at
your
bra-in
I'm
slightly
insa-ne!
-
Vodka
and
Creatine
Hypnotic
and
Red
Bull,
it's
an
incredible
energy
drink.
And
it's
giving
me
wings!
-
I
believe
I
can
fly.
While
I
pee
on
the
girl
you
won't
catch
me
CSI!
It's
as
easy
as
pie!
-
And
as
simple
as
cake.
Dre
get
on
the
mic
[scratches]
and
make
them
tremble
and
shake!
[Dr.
Dre:]
Now
put
your
smoke
up
in
the
air,
raise
your
hand
and
your
coke
And
if
you
really
want
to
get
fucked
up!
-
Just
let
me
know!
We
can
smoke
if
there
is
no
more
lighter
fluid
to
do
it,
Let's
get
into
it!
-
You
smoking
with
the
triedest
and
truest.
I
got
the
Midas
touch
when
it
comes
to
rolling
shit
up
You
muthafuckers
ain't
smoking,
you
just
holding
shit
up!
Now
here
we
go,
let's
get
up,
get
down,
hold
up
a
blunt
I
smoke
the
kind
of
stuff
that
makes
the
records
go
number
one.
Cause
if
at
first
you
don't
succeed.
-
Won't
hurt
to
smoke
some
weed.
Now
them
words
are
just
a
little
more
personal
for
me
Seeing
as
how
-
I
blew
up
off
puffing
them
trees
[Eminem
{Dre}:]
Was
luck
enough
for
me,
fuck
yeah,
light
it
up
cheech!
Come
on
smoke
me
up
cause,
get
me
contact
buzz!
Get

on
track,
they
love
me
when
I'm
on
that
stuff!
"But

Earth
calling
Shady,
man
come
on
back!
"
(whaaaat?)
"Man
we're
losing
him!
He
won't
even
respond
back
fuck!
Now
look
at
all
the
pretty
women
in
here.
{Damn
bitches!
}
Dre
it's
hot
I
think
we
better
go
check
on
their
temperatures.
I
get
the
thermometer
you
get
the
bandages,
Now
baby
just
bend
over
this
won't
hurt
a
damn
bitness!
[Chorus]
Yea,
(oh,
oh),
yea
yea,
oh
I
feel
like
dancing
I
feel
like
dancing
I
smell
something
in
the
air
that's
making
me

I
said
I
smell
something
in
the

that's
making

high
Ok

pill,
you
are
literally
getting
the
drill
Spitting
at
will,
me
and
Dre
have
just
finished
splitting
a
pill
You're
submitting
to
skill,
sitting
still,
I'm
admitting,
I'm
beginning
to
feel
Like
I
don't
think
anyone's
real,
Faced
with
a
dilemma,
I
can
be
Dali
Llama
and
become
a
bin
gramma
a
step
beyond
a
Jeffrey
Dahmer
Please
don't
upset
me
mama,
you
lookin
sexy
mama,
Don't
know
if
this
the
lala
or
the
rum
and
pepsi
mama
Don't
want
to
end
up
inside
my
refrigerator
freezer,
Be
used
as
extra
topping
the
next
time
I
make
a
pizza
How
many
people
you
know
can
name
every
serial
killer
who
ever
existed
in
a
row,
Put
em
in
chronological
order
beginning
with
Jack
the
Ripper,
Name
the
time
and
place
from
the
body
the
bag
the
zipper,
Location
of
the
woods
where
the
body
was
dragged
and
then
dumped,
The
trunk
that
they
were
stuffed
in,
the
model
the
make
the
plate
And
which
motel
which
lake
they
found
her
in,
And
how
they
attacked
the
victim,
Say
which
murder
weapon
was
used
to
do
what
and
which
one,
Which
night
it
was
done,
what
kid
would
write
there
was
none,
So
sloppy
like
this
it's
fun,
the
fuckin
ecstasy
goes
It
must
be
the
ganja
It's
the
marijuana
That's
creepin
upon
me
why
I'm
so
high
Maybe
it's
the
hinde
that
has
gotten
in
me
Whatever's
gotten
into
me
I
don't
mind
It
must
be
the
ganja
It's
the
marijuana
That's
creepin
upon
me
why
I'm
so
high
Maybe
it's
the
hinde
that
has
gotten
in
me
Whatever's
gotten
into
me
I
don't
mind
When
I'm
behind
a
mic
dynamite
is
what
it's
kinda
like
Get
stuck
with
that
same
stick
that
you're
trying
to
light
Behind
the
boards
is
Dre,
legends
are
made
this
way
Isn't
it
safe
to
say,
this
is
the
way
it
should
be?
Maybe
you
need
some
lyric
syrup
sign
for
your
symptoms
Heres
a
dosage
of
the
antidote
now
you
give
him
some,
He
can
give
her
some,
she
can
give
him
some
Get
behind
a
lynn
drum,
make
up
a
beat
and
kill
the
sucka
syndrome
You're
spitting
drama
when
it
comes
to
lyrics
and
penance
I'm
Starting
from
scratch
and
then
ending
up
at
the
end
ending
up
Capable
of
bringing
a
bullets
a
stillunbelievable
bullets
a
Titanium
brain
that's
full
of,
surprises
When
the
smoke
rises
right
before
your
very
own
eyes
You
stare
into
your
stereos
eyes
Good
evening,
this
ain't
even
a
weed
thing,
I
didn't
even
smoke
anything,
I
didn't
even
drink
anything
It
must
be
the
ganja
It's
the
marijuana
That's
creepin
upon
me
why
I'm
so
high
Maybe
it's
the
hinde
that
has
gotten
in
me
Whatever's
gotten
into
me
I
don't
mind
It
must
be
the
ganja
It's
the
marijuana
That's
creepin
upon
me
why
I'm
so
high
Maybe
it's
the
hinde
that
has
gotten
in
me
Whatever's
gotten
into
me
I
don't
mind

[Verse
1:]
As
I
fall
deeper
into
a
manic
state
I'm
a
prime
canidate
for
the
gene
to
recieve
the
drug
addict
traits
Blood
pressure
climbs
at
a
dramatic
rate
I
seem
to
gravitate
to
the
bottle
of
nyquil
then
I
salivate
Start
off
with
the
nyquil
like
I
think
I'll
just
have
a
taste
Couple
sips
of
that
then
I
gradually
graduate
Too
a
harder
perscription
drug
called
valium
like
ya
that's
great
I
go
to
take
just
one
and
I
end
up
like
having
eight
Now
I
need
something
in
my
stomach
cause
I
haven't
ate
Maybe
I'll
grab
a
plate
of
nachos
and
I'll
have
a
steak
And
you'd
think
with
all
I
have
at
stake
Look
at
my
daughters
face...
Mommy
somethings
is
wrong
with
dad
I
think
He's
acting
weird
again
he's
really
begining
to
scare
me
Won't
shave
his
beard
again
and
he
pretends
he
doesn't
hear
me
And
all
he
does
is
eat
dorritos
and
cheetos
And
he
just
fell
asleep
in
his
car
eating
three
musketeers
in
the
rear
seat
[Hook:]
Sometimes
I
feel
so
alone,
I
just
don't
know,
feels
like
I
been
down
this
road
before,
So
lonely
and
cold,
It's
like
something
takes
over
me,
Soon
as
I
go
home
and
close
the
door,
Kinda
feels
like
deja
vu,
I
wanna
get
away
from
this
place
I
do,
But
I
can't
and
I
won't
say
I
tried
but
I
know
that's
a
lie
cause
I
don't
And
why
I
just
don't
know...
[Verse
2:]
Maybe
just
a
nice
cold
brew
what's
a
beer
That's
the
devil
in
my
ear
I
been
sober
a
fuckin
year
And
that
fucker
still
talks
to
me
he
is
all
I
can
fuckin
hear
Marshall
come
on
we'll
watch
the
game
it's
the
cowboys
and
buccaneers
And
maybe
if
I
just
drink
half
I'll
be
half
as
buzzed
for
half
of
the
time
Who's
the
mastermind
behind
that
little
line
With
that
kind
of
rational
mind
I
got
half
a
mind
To
have
another
half
a
glass
of
wine
sound
asinine
Ya
I
know
But
I
never
had
no
problem
with
alcohol
Ouch
look
out
for
the
wall
aim
for
the
couch
I'm
about
to
fall
I
missed
the
couch
and
down
I
go
looking
like
a
bouncing
ball
Shit
must
have
knocked
me
out
cause
I
ain't
feel
the
ground
at
all
Wow
what
the
fuck
happend
last
night
where
am
I
Man
fuck
am
I
hungover
and
god
damn
I
got
a
head
ache
Shit
half
a
vicodin
why
can't
I?
"
All
systems
ready
for
take
off
please
stand
by
"
[Hook:]
Sometimes
I
feel
so
alone,
I
just
don't
know,
feels
like
I
been
down
this
road
before,
So
lonely
and
cold,
It's
like
something
takes
over
me,
Soon
as
I
go
home
and
close

Kinda

But
I

I

that's
a

cause
I
don't
And
why
I
just
don't
know...
[Verse
3:]
So
I
take
a
vicodin
splash
it
hits
my
stomach
and
ahh
A
couple
weeks
go
by
it
ain't
even
like
I'm
getting
high
Now
I
need
it
just
not
to
feel
sick
ya
I'm
getting
by
Wouldn't
even
be
taking
this
shit
if
deshaun
didn't
die
Oh
ya
there's
an
excuse
you
lose
proof
so
you
use
There's
new
rules
it's
cool
if
it's
helpin
you
to
get
through
It's
twelve
noon
ain't
no
harm
in
self
inducing
a
snooze
What
else
is
new
fuck
it
what
would
elvis
do
in
your
shoes
Now
here
I
am
3
months
later
full
blown
relapse
Just
get
high
untill
the
kids
get
home
from
school
homes
relax
And
since
I'm
convinced
that
I'm
an
in-somniac
I
need
these
pills
to
be
able
to
sleep
so
I
take
3
naps
Just
to
be
able
to
function
throughout
the
day
let's
see
That's
an
ambien
each
nap
how
many
valium
3
And
that
will
average
out
to
about
one
good
hour
sleep
Ok
so
now
you
see
the
reason
how
come
he
Has
taken
4
years
just
too
put
out
an
album
b
See
me
and
you
we
almost
had
the
same
outcome
Heath
Cause
that
christmas
you
know
the
pneumonia
thing
It
was
bolognya
was
it
the
methadone
ya
think
Or
the
hydrocodone
you
hide
inside
your
pornos
Your
vcr
tape
cases
with
your
ambien
cr
great
places
to
hide
ain't
it
So
you
can
lie
to
hailie
I'm
going
beddy
bye
whitney
baby
good
night
elaina
Go
in
the
room
and
shut
the
bedroom
door
and
wake
up
in
ambulance
They
said
they
found
me
on
the
bathroom
floor
[Hook:]
Sometimes
I
feel
so
alone,
I
just
don't
know,
feels
like
I
been

So
lonely
and
cold,
It's

Soon

lyrics)
Lately
I've
been
hard
to
reach
I've
been
too
long
on
my
own
Everybody
has
a
private
world
Where
they
can
be
alone
Are
you
calling
me?
Are
you
trying
to
get
through?
Are
you
reaching
out
for
me?
I'm
reaching
out
for
you...
I'm
just
so
fuckin
depressed,
I
just
can't
seem
to
get
out
this
slump
If
I
could
just
get
over
this
hump,
but
I
need
something
to
pull
me
out
this
dump
I
took
my
bruises,
took
my
lumps,
fell
down
and
I
got
right
back
up
But
I
need
that
spark
to
get
psyched
back
up,
in
order
for
me
to
pick
the
mic
back
up
I
don't
know
how
or
why
or
when
I
ended
up
in
this
position
I'm
in
I'm
startin
to
feel
distant
again,
so
I
decided
just
to
pick
this
pen
Up
and
try
to
make
an
attempt
to
vent
but
I
just
can't
admit
or
come
to
grips
With
the
fact
that
I
may
be
done
with
rap,
I
need
a
new
outlet
And
I
know
some
shit
so
hard
to
swallow,
but
I
just
can't
sit
back
and
wallow
In
my
own
sorrow,
but
I
know
one
fact,
I'll
be
one
tough
act
to
follow
One
tough
act
to
follow
I'll
be
one
tough
act
to
follow
Here
today,
gone
tomorrow,
but
you'd
have
to
walk
a
thousand
miles...
In
my
shoes,
just
to
see,
what
it's
like
to
be
me,
I'll
be
you,
let's
trade
shoes
Just
to
see
what
it'd
be
like
to
feel
your
pain,
you
feel
mine,
go
inside
each
others
minds
Just
to
see
what
we'd
find,
look
at
shit
through
each
others
eyes
But
don't
let
them
say
you
ain't
beautiful
They
can
all
get
FUCKED,
just
stay
true
to
you
So
don't
let
them
say
you
ain't
beautiful
They
can
all
get
FUCKED,
just
stay
true
to
you
I
think
I'm
startin
to
lose
my
sense
of
humor,
everythings
so
tense
and
gloom,
I
Almost
feel
like
I
got
to
check
the
temperture
of
the
room
just
as
soon
as
I
walk
in,
it's
like
all
eyes
on
me,
so
I
try
to
avoid
any
eye
contact
Cause
if
I
do
that,
then
it
opens
the
door
for
coversation,
like
I
want
that
I'm
not
looking
for
extra
attention,
I
just
want
to
be
just
like
you
Blend
in
with
the
rest
of
the
room,
maybe
just
point
me
to
the
closest
restroom
I
don't
need
no
fuckin
man
servant,
tryna
follow
me
around
and
wipe
my
ass
And
laugh
at
every
single
joke
I
crack
and
half
of
them
ain't
even
funny
like
"Ahh,
Marshall
you're
so
funny
man
you
should
be
a
comedian,
god
damn"
Unfortunately
I
am,
I
just
hide
behind
the
tears
of
a
clown
So
why
don't
you
all
sit
down,
listen
to
the
tale
I'm
about
to
tell
Hell,
we
ain't
gotta
trade
our
shoes,
and
you
ain't
gotta
walk
no
thousand
miles
In
my
shoes,
just
to
see,
what
it's
like
to
be
me,
I'll
be
you,
let's
trade
shoes
Just
to
see
what
it'd
be
like
to
feel
your
pain,
you
feel
mine,
go
inside
each
others
minds
Just
to
see
what
we'd
find,
look
at
shit
through
each
others
eyes
Nobody
asked
for
life
to
deal
us
what
these
bullshit
hands
were
dealt
We
gotta
take
these
cards
ourselves,
and
flip
them,
don't
expect
no
help
Now
I
could
of
either
just
sat
on
my
ass
and
pissed
and
moaned
Or
take
this
situation
in
which
I'm
placed,
and
get
up
and
get
my
own
I
was
never
the
type
of
kid
to
wait
by
the
door
and
pack
his
bags
Or
sat
on
the
porch
and
hoped
and
pray
for
a
dad
to
show
up
who
never
did
I
just
wanted
to
fit
in,
in
every
single
place,
every
school
I
went
I
dreamed
of
being
that
cool
kid,
even
if
it
meant
actin
stupid
And
Aunt
Edna
was
told
me,
keep
makin
that
face
it'll
get
stuck
like
that
Meanwhile
I'm
just
standin
there
holdin
my
tongue
tryna
talk
like
"thissss"
Till
I
stuck
my
tongue
on
that
frozen
stop
sign
pole
at
8
years
old
I
learned
my
lesson
then,
cause
I
wasn't
tryin
to
impress
my
friends
no
more
But
I
already
told
you
my
whole
life
story,
not
just
based
on
my
description
Cause
where
you
see
it,
from
where
you're
sittin,
it's
probably
110
percent
different
I
guess
we
would
have
to
walk
a
mile
in
each
others
shoes
at
least
What
size
you
wear?
I
wear
10's,
let's
see
if
you
could
fit
your
feet...
In
my
shoes,
just
to
see,
what
it's
like
to
be
me,
I'll
be
you,
let's
trade
shoes
Just
to
see
what
it'd
be
like
to
feel
your
pain,
you
feel
mine,
go
inside
each
others
minds
Just
to
see
what
we'd
find,
look
at
shit
through
each
others
eyes
Lately
I've
been
hard
to
reach
I've
been
too
long
on
my
own
Everybody
has
their
private
world
Where
they
can
be
alone
Are
you
calling
me?
Are
you
trying
to
get
through?
Are
you
reaching
out
for
me?
I'm
reaching
out
for
you...
Yeah,
to
my
babies,
stay
strong.
Dad
will
be
home
soon.
And
to
the
rest
of
the
world,
God
gave
you
them
shoes,
to
fit
you,
so
put
them
on
and
wear
em.
Be
yourself
man.
Be
proud
of
who
you
are.
Even
if
it
sounds
corny,
don't
ever
let
anyone
tell
you,
you
ain't
beautiful.

Ooww
Ladies
and
gentlemen
The
moment
you've
all
been
waiting
for...
In
this
corner:
weighing
175
pounds,
With
a
record
of
17
rapes,
400
assaults,
and
4
murders,
The
undisputed,
most
diabolic
villain
in
the
world:
Slim
Shady!
[Chorus:
Eminem]
So
crack
a
bottle,
let
your
body
waddle
Don't
act
like
a
snobby
model
you
just
hit
the
lotto
O-oh
o-oh,
bitches
hopping
in
my
Tahoe
Got
one
riding
shotgun
and
no
not
one
of
them
got
gloves
Now
where's
the
rubbers?
Whose
got
the
rubbers?
I
noticed
there's
so
many
of
them
And
there's
really
not
that
many
of
us.
Ladies
love
us
and
my
posse's
kicking
up
dust.
It's
on
till
the
break
of
dawn
And
we're
starting
this
party
from
dusk
Ok...
let's
go
[Eminem:]
Back
when
Andre,
the
giant,
mister
elephant
tusk
Fix
your
must,
you'll
just
be
another
one
bit
the
dust
Just
one
up
my
mothers
son
who
got
thrown
under
the
bus
Kiss
my
butt.
Lick
from
under
cheese
from
under
my
nuts
It
disgusts
me
to
see
the
game
the
way
that
it
looks
It's
a
must
I
redeem
my
name
n
haters
get
mushed.
Bitches
lust.
Man
they
love
me
when
I
lay
in
the
cut.
Fist
the
cut.
The
lady
give
her
eighty
some
paper
cut.
Now
picture
us.
It's
ridiculous
you
curse
at
the
thought
Cause
when
I
spit
the
verse
the
shit
Gets
worse
and
worse
cause
your
soft
If
I
could
fit
the
words
as
picture
perfect,
works
every
time
Every
verse,
every
line,
as
simple
as
nursery
rhymes
It's
elementary.
The
elephants
have
entered
the
room.
I
venture
to
say
with
the
center
of
attention
it's
true
Not
to
mention
back
with
a
vengeance
so
heres
the
signal
Of
the
bat
symbol.
The
platinum
trio's
back
on
you
hoes.
[Chorus:
Eminem]
So
crack
a
bottle,
let
your
body
waddle.
Don't
act
like
a
snobby
model.
You
just
hit
the
lotto.
O-oh
o-oh,
bitches
hopping
in
my
Tahoe
.
Got
one
riding
shotgun
and
no
not
one
of
them
got
gloves
Now
wheres
the
rubbers?
Whose
got
the
rubbers?
I
noticed
there's
so
many
of
them
And
there's
really
not
that
many
of
us.
Ladies
love
us
and
my
posses
kicking
up
dust.
It's
on
till
the
break
of
dawn
and
were
starting
this
party
from
dusk.
Ladies
and
gentlemen,
Dr.
Dre
[Dr
Dre:]
They
see
that
low
rider
go
by
there,
like
Oh
my!
You
ain't
got
to
tell
me
why
you're
sick
cause
I
know
why.
I
dip
through
in
that
six
trey
like
sick
em
Dre.
I'm
an
itch
that
they
can't
scratch,
they're
sick
of
me.
But
hey,
what
else
can
I
say?
I
love
LA.
Cause
over
and
above
all,
it's
just
another
day
And
this
one
begins
where
the
last
one
ends.
Pick
up
where
we
left
off
and
get
smashed
again.
I'll
be
dammed,
just
fucked
around
and
crashed
my
Benz.
Driving
around
with
a
smashed
front
end
Let's
cash
that
one
in.
Grab
another
one
from
out
the
stable
The
Monte
Carlo,
El
Camino
or
the
El
Derado
The
hell
if
I
know.
Do
I
want
leather
seats
or
vinyl?
Decisions,
decision
Garage
looks
like
precision
collision.
Or
maico
beats
quake
like
Waco
Just
keep
the
bass
low
speakers
away
from
your
face
though
[Chorus:
Eminem]
So
crack
a
bottle,
let
your
body
waddle.
Don't
act

pleasure
in

50
Cent
[50

It's

The

(Eminem):]
About

Send

(Steve!
Good

Look
who
decided
to
show
his
face!
I
hope
you've
had
fun
in
the
last
4
years.
(Look
man,
I
apologise
again
for-)
For
shooting
me?
!
Do
you
know
I

the
use
of
my
right
arm?
(Again,
it
was
a
mistake,)
(a
terrible
mist-
are
you
wearing
a
bulletproof
vest?)
And
then
you
go
and
you
do
what?
Hide
out?
stay
in
Detroit
from
us
5
years
while
the
music
industry
melts
the
fuck
down?
Do
you
know
how
many
people
lost
their
jobs
because
of
your
fuckin
vacation?
(Well
that's
actually
why
I'm
here,
I
was
gonna,
put
out
some
new
music
and
I
wanted
to
play
it
for
you,
and
get
your
opinion)
Do
I
really
need
to
hear
it?
Let
me
guess,
another
album
about
poor
me,
I'm
so
famous
that
it's
ruined
my
rich
little
life,
and
I'm
such
a
tortured
artist.
Let
me
make
music
about
it
and
my
tragic
love
life,
am
I
on
to
something
here?
(Come
on
man
it's
not
like
that
yo-)
You
know
what?
Just
hand
the
fuckin
thing
over
I'm
done
talkin
to
you.
Think
you
can
just
come
and
go
as
you
please.
Big
selfish
superstar
(Steve,
I
had
a
drug
problem)
Oh
poor
me,
I
had
a
drug
problem.
Who
hasn't
had
a
drug
problem
in
this
town?
You
know
what?

(Hey!

Just

(Woah,

(Alright

What's

shit?
Two
CD's?
(That's
what
I've

to

2
albums)
Just

(Alright!)
Get

A

Six

Seventeen

Found
in
the
back
of
a
van
After
the
shoot
at
Vanity
Fair
Hannah
Montana
Prepare
to
elope
with
a
can
opener
And
feet
cut
open
like
cantaloupe
on
canopy
beds
And
Glad
bags,
yeah
glad
to

'Cause
last
year
was
a
tragedy
That
landed
me
smack
dab
in
rehab
Fuckin'
doctor
I
ain't
understand
a
damn
what
he
said
I
planned
a
relapse
the
second
I
walked
out
of
that
bitch
Two
weeks
in
Brighton
I
ain't
enlightened
Bitin'
into
a
fuckin'
biket
and
light
them
a

Oh
Lightning

striking
Might
be
a

And
I
need
a

Evaluation
Fuck
Jason
It's
Friday
the
19th
That
means
it's
just
a
regular
day
And
this
is
the
kind
of
shit
I
think
of
regu-lar-ly
Fuckin'
lesbians
Shouldn't
have
had
her
legs
in
the

Now
she's
pregnant
and
gay
Missin'

and
beggin'
to
stay
[Chorus]
Here

And

No

Don't

Looking

Here

No

Looking

[Verse

Tell
the
critics
I'm
back
and
I'm
coming
To
spit
it
back
in
abundance
Hit
a
fag
with
onions
And
split
a
bag
of
Funyuns
Mad
at
me
Understandable
Cannibal
Shoot
an
animal
Out
of
a
cannon
And
have
'em
catapult...
At
an
adult
Captain
of
a
cult
With
an
elite
following
To
turn
Halloween
back
To
a
trick-or-treat
holiday
Had
Michael
Myers
lookin'
like
a
liar
Swipe
his
powers
Replace
his
knife
with
flowers
and
a
stack
of
flyers
Hit
Jason
Voorhees
with
a
forty
Stuck
a
suppository
up
his
ass
And
made
him
tell
me
a
story
Gave
Hannibal
Lecter
a
fucking
nectarine
And
sat
him
in
a
fucking
fruit
and
vegetable
section
and
gave
him
a
lecture
Walked
up
Elm
street
with
a
fucking
(?)
Fought
Freddy
Krueger
and
Edward
Scissorhands
too
And
came
out
with
a
little
scratch,
ooh
Lookin'
like
I
got
in
a
fuckin'
pillow
fight
with
a
Triple
FAT
Goose
Insanity
Can't
it
be
Vanity
Where's
the
humanity
In
having
a
twisted
fantasy
With
an
arm
and
leg
amputee
Straitjacket
Wit'
a
hundred
and
8
brackets
And
a
strap
that
wraps
twice
around
my
back
Then
they
latch
it
Cut
your
fuckin'
head
off
and
ask
where
you
headed
off
to
Get
it?
Headed
off
to?
Medic,
this
headache's
awful
This
anaesthetic's
pathetic
So
is
this
diabetic
waffle
And
this
prosthetic
arm
keeps
crushing
my
hard
taco!
[Chorus]
Here
comes
the
rain!
And
thunder
now!
No
where
to
run!
To
run
to
now!
I've
disappeared!
Don't
wonder
how!
Looking
for
me!
I'm
underground!
Here
comes
the
rain!
And
thunder
now!
No
where
to
run!
To
run
to
now!
I've
disappeared!
Don't
wonder
how!
Looking
for
me!
I'm
underground!
[Verse
1]
If
I
woulda
rap
about
the
crap
that's
out
That's
the
route
you
probably
want
me
to
take
Cause
you're
just
dyin'
to
know
what
I
think
And
my
take
on
some
other
rappers
If
I
was
to
say
something
about
Paul
Wall,
you'd
probably
crap
in
your
Pants,
cause
I'm
white,
and
he's
white,
so
he's
like
My
competition
I
mean,
right?
Nope,
Paul
Wall
is
dope
And
so's
Bubba,
so
BLALALALAPFFTTTTT
B-b-b-b-b-but,
I
don't
compete
with
nobody
I
just
go
hard,
do
the
rope-a-dope
Ali
Shuffle,
and
dance
around
my
opponents,
you
don't
Sometime's
I
just
play
possom,
Like
I'm
asleep
that's
awesome
I'm
like
a
sleeping
Giant,
and
when
I
awake
I'm
like
Dre
I
just
jump
from
outta
nowhere
and
bite
Prey
Sink
my
teeth
in
him
and
fill
him,
full
of
poison
And
make
a
noise
like
snake
before
I
kill
him
And
let
him
know
that
I
just
don't
feel
him
And
smack
him
with
the
backward
E,
the
Eminem
emblem
Always
thought
if
you
was
gonna
murder
somebody
you
should
face
em
Tell
em
why,
look
them
dead
in
the
eye,
then
waste
em
And
the
dark
shall
emerge
from
the
fiery
depths
of
hell
And
swallow
the
shell
of
the
hollow
who
dwell
And
the
shadows
of
all
who
are
willing
to
sell
Their
souls,
for
this
rap
game,
and
it
g-g-goes
123,
123,
123,
that
ain't
the
hook,
now
follow
me
There's
nothing
else
for
me
to
say,
my
public
adores
me
Everybody
bores
me,
they're
just
so
corny
So
at
night
before
I
sleep,
I
look
in
the
mirror
The
mirror
grows
lips
and
it
whispers
"Come
nearer"
[Chorus]
My
Darling,
I
don't
ever
want
you
to
leave
me
My
Darling,
you
and
me
were
meant
to
be
together
My
Darling,
And
if
I
cannot
have
you,
no
one
can,
you're
my
My
Darling,
cause
I
possess
your
soul,
your
mind,
your
heart
and
your
body
I
don't
ever
want
you
to
leave
me
My
Darling,
you
and
me
were
meant
to
be
together
My
Darling,
And
if
I
cannot
have
you,
no
one
can,
you're
my
My
Darling,
cause
I
possess
your
soul,
your
mind,
your
heart
and
your
body

"Well

All

I
had

"No

WHY!
"Because

Isn't

[Chorus]
My

I

"Shady,
listen...
"SHADY!",
you
hear
that?
They're
screaming
for
you,
I
can
bring
your
career
back"
But
I
don't
want
it
back!
"Yes
you
do..."
No
I
don't!
"Yes
you
do,
you're
gonna
regret
it
later!"
No
I
won't!
"I'ma
get
Dre
on
the
phone,
I'll
just
call
the
doctor"
Go
ahead,
I
already
talked
to,
Dre
yesterday
"Well
I
got
him
on
the
phone
right
now!"
You're
lying,
"yo
slim",
HOW,
WHY
NOW!
Whatup
Dre?
"Check
this
out
Slim,
I
gotta
talk
to
ya
I
don't
know,
it
just
seems
every
since
you
got
off
ya
Drugs,
you
became
a
lot
softer"
But
Dre,
all
Shady
is
is
a
bottle
of
hair
bleach
and
vodka
"Well,
just
think
about
it
Slim,
I'm
here
Just
hit
me
back,
and
let
me
know
what's
up"
Fuck
this
mirror!
AHHHHHHH
"I'm
not
in
the
mirror,
I'm
inside
you,
let
me
guide
you"
Fuck
you,
die
you
son
of
a
bitch
"Put
the
gun
down",
BYE
BYE!
Ok
I'm
still
alive,
"So
am
I
too!
You
can
kill
a
spirit,
even
if
you
tried
to
Haha,
you
sold
your
soul
to
me,
need
I
remind
you?
You
remember
that
night
you,
prayed
to
god
You'd
give
anything
to
get
a
record
deal,
well
Dre
signed
you
This
is
what
you
wanted
your
whole
life
Marshall,
right
through
Look
at
this
house,
look
at
these
cars,
I'm
so
nice,
wooo!
Oh,
but
you
didn't
know,
fame
has
a
price
too
That
you're
just
now
seeing
the
downside
to
Lose
your
best
friend
from
highschool,
your
wife
too
Ain't
even
sure
if
your
kids
like
you
Come
off
tour,
can't
even
sleep
at
night
without
Nyquill
Become
a
valium
addict,
start
a
rehab
cycle
But
together
we
can
break
the
cycle
Marshall..."
WHAT!
"no
one's
gonna
love
you
like
I
do!"
[Chorus]
My
Darling,
I
don't
ever
want
you
to
leave
me
My
Darling,
you
and
me
were
meant
to
be
together
My

and
if
I
cannot
have
you,
no
one
can,
you're
my
My

cause
I

I
don't

were
meant

and
if
I
cannot

cause
I

[Verse
1]
So
this
is
it...
This
is
what
I
wished
for
Just
isn't
how
I
envisioned
it
Feigned
to
the
point
of
imprisonment
I
just
thought
the
shit'd
be
different
But
something
changed
The
minute
that
I
got
a
whiff
of
it
I
started
to
inhale
it
Smell
it
Started
sniffin'
it
And
it
became
my
cocaine
I
just
couldn't
quit
I
just
wanted
a
little
bit
Then
it
turned
me
(in)
to
a
monster
I
became
a
hypocrite
Concert
after
concert
I
was
raking
in
the
dough
Rolling
in
green
Had
the
game
hemmed
up
Like
a
sewing
machine
But
I
was
losing
my
freedom
There
was
no
where
for
me
To
not
go
and
be
seen
And
just
go
and
be
me
And
there
was
no
in-between
You
either
loved
it
or
hate
it
Every
CD
critics
gave
it
a
3,
then
3
Years
later,
they'd
go
back
and
re-rate
it
And
call
the
Slim
Shady
LP
the
greatest
The
Marshall
Mathers
was
a
classic
The
Eminem
Show
was
fantastic
But
Encore
just
didn't
have
the
caliber
to
match
it
I
guess
enough
time
just
ain't
passed,
yet
A
couple
more
years,
that
shit'll
be
ill-matic
And
eight
years
later,
I'm
still
at
it
Divorce,
re-married
A
felon
A
father
Sleeping
pill
addict
And
this
is
real
talk
I
feel
like
the
Incredible
Hulk
My
back
has
been
broke,
and
I
can
still
walk
[Chorus]
So
be
careful
what
you
wish
for
'Cause
you
just
might
get
it
And
if
you
get
it
then
you
just
might
not
know
What
to
do
wit'
it,
'cause
it
might
just
Come
back
on
you
ten-fold
I
said
Be
careful
what
you
wish
for
'Cause
you
just
might
get
it
And
if
you
get
it
then
you
just
might
not
know
What
to
do
wit'
it,
'cause
it
might
just
Come
back
on
you
ten-fold
[Verse
2]
I
got
a
letter
from
a
fan,
that
said
He's
been
praying
for
me
Every
day
and
for
some
reason
It's
been
weighing
on
my
mind
heavy
'Cause
I
don't
read
every
Letter
I
get,
but
something
told
me
to
go
ahead
and
open
it,
but
Why
would
someone
pray
for
you
when
they
don't
know
you?
You
didn't
pray
for
me
when
I
was
local
And
as
I
lay
these
vocals
I
think
of
all
the
shit
I
had
to
go
through
Just
to
get
to
where
I'm
at
I've
already
told
you
at
least
A
thousand
times
in
these
rhymes
I
appreciate
the
prayer,
but
I've
already
got
God
on
my
side
And
it's
been
one
hell
of
a
ride,
hasn't
it?
Just
watchin'
it
from
an
opposite
standpoint
Man,
boy's
got
to
look
Nuts
And
that's
the
only
word
I
can
think
of
right
now
On
how
To
describe
the
shit
This
is
like
a
vibe
you
get
Go
ahead
and
bob
to
it
Just
watch
what
you
wish
for,
'cause
I
got
the
shit
[Chorus]
So
be
careful
what
you
wish
for
'Cause
you
just
might
get
it
And
if
you
get
it
then
you
just
might
not
know
What
to
do
wit'
it,
'cause
it
might
just
Come
back
on
you
ten-fold
I
said
Be
careful
what
you
wish
for
'Cause
you
just
might
get
it
And
if
you
get
it
then
you
just
might
not
know
What
to
do
wit'
it,
'cause
it
might
just
Come
back
on
you
ten-fold
It
may
not
mean
nothin'
to
y'all
But
understand,
nothin'
was
done
for
me
So
I
don't
plan
on
stoppin'
at
all
I
want
this
shit
forever,
man—ever,
man—ever,
man
I'm
shuttin'
shit
down
in
the
mall
And
tellin'
every
girl
she
the
one
for
me
And
I
ain't
even
plannin'
to
call
I
want
this
shit
forever,
man—ever,
man—ever,
man
Last
name
Ever—first
name
Greatest
Like
a
sprained
ankle,
boy,
I
ain't
nothin'
to
play
with
Started
off
local,
but
thanks
to
all
the
haters
I
know
G-IV
pilots
on
a
first
name
basis
In
your
city,
faded
off
the
brown—Nino
She
insist
she
got
more
class—we
know
Swimmin'
in
the
money,
come
and
find
me—Nemo
If
I
was
at
the
club,
you
know
I
balled—chemo
Dropped
the
mixtape,
that
shit
sounded
like
an
album
Who'd
have
thought
a
countrywide
tour'd
be
the
outcome?
Labels
want
my
name
beside
a
X,
like
Malcolm
Everybody
got
a
deal—I
did
it
without
one
Yeah,
nigga,
I'm
about
my
business
Killin'
all
these
rappers,
you
would
swear
I
had
a
hit
list
Everyone
who
doubted
me
is
askin'
for
forgiveness
If
you
ain't
been
a
part
of
it,
at
least
you
got
to
witness—bitches
It
may
not
mean
nothin'
to
y'all
But
understand,
nothin'
was
done
for
me
So
I
don't
plan
on
stoppin'
at
all
I
want
this
shit
forever,
man—ever,
man—ever,
man
I'm
shuttin'

down
in

And
tellin'
every
girl
she
the

for
me
And
I
ain't
even
plannin'
to
call
I
want
this
shit
forever,
man—ever,
man—ever,
man
Ever-ever,
Mr.
West
is
in
the
buildin'
Ain't
no
question
who
about
to
kill
'em
I
used
to
have
hood
dreams,
big
fame,
big
chains
I
stuck
my
dick
inside
this
life
until
that
bitch
came
And
went
hard,
all
fall
like
the
ball
teams
Just
so
I
can
make
it
rain
all
spring
Y'all
seen
my
story,
my
glory
I
had
raped
the
game
young,
you
can
call
it
statutory
When
a
nigga
blow
up
they
gonna
build
statues
for
me
Old
money;
Benjamin
Button
"What?"
nothin'
Now
super
bad
chicks
givin'
me
McLovin
You
would
think
I
ran
the
world,
like
Michelle's
husband
You
would
think
these
niggas
know
me,
when
they
really
doesn't
Like
they
was
down
with
the
old
me
–
no,
you
fuckin'
wasn't
Um,
you're
such
a
fuckin'
loser
He
ain't
even
go
to
class:
Bueller
Trade
the
Grammy
plaques
just
to
have
my
granny
back
Remember
she
had
that
bad
hip
like
a
fanny
pack?
Chasin'
the
stardom
will
turn
you
to
a
maniac
All
the
way
in
Hollywood
and
I
can't
even
act
They
pull
the
cameras
out
and
goddamn,
he
snap
I
used
to
want
this
thing
forever,
y'all
can
have
it
back
It
may
not
mean
nothin'
to
y'all
But
understand,
nothin'
was
done
for
me
So
I
don't
plan
on
stoppin'
at
all
I
want
this
shit
forever,
man—ever,
man—ever,
man
I'm
shuttin'

And

And
I
ain't

I
want

forever,
man—ever,
man—ever,
man
Okay,
hello—it's
the
Martian,
Space
Jam
Jordans
I
want
this
shit
forever,
wake
up
and
smell
the
garden
Fresher
than
the
harvest,
step
up
to
the
target
If
I
had
one
guess,
then
I
guess
I'm
just
New
Orleans
And
I
will
never
stop
like
I'm
runnin'
from
the
cops
Hop
up
in
my
car
and
told
my
chauffeur,
"To
the
top!"
Life
is
such
a
fuckin'
roller
coaster,
then
it
drops
But
what
should
I
scream
for?
This
is
my
theme
park
My
mind
shine
even
when
my
thoughts
seem
dark
Pistol
on
my
side,
you
don't
wanna
hear
that
thing
talk
Let
the
king
talk,
check
the
price
and
pay
attention
Lil
Wayne,
that's
what
they
gotta
say
or
mention
I'm
like
Nevada
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
I'm
restin'
in
the
lead,
I
need
a
pillow
and
a
cover
Shhh,
my
foot's
sleepin'
on
the
gas
No
brake
pads,
no
such
thing
as
last,
uh
It
may
not
mean
nothin'
to
y'all
But
understand,
nothin'
was
done
for
me
So
I
don't
plan
on
stoppin'
at
all
I
want
this
shit
forever,
man—ever,
man—ever,
man
I'm
shuttin'

And
tellin'

And
I

There
they
go—packin'
stadiums
as
Shady
spits
his
flow
Nuts
they
go—Macadamian—they
go
so
ballistic,
whoa
He
can
make
them
look
like
bozos,
he's
wonderin'
if
he
should
spit
this
slow
—fuck
no!
Go
for
broke,
his
cup
just
runneth
over—oh,
no
He
ain't
had
him
a
buzz
like
this
since
the
last
time
that
he
overdosed
They
been
waitin'
patiently
for
Pinocchio
to
poke
his
nose
Back
into
the
game
and
they
know,
rap
will
never
be
same
as
befo'
Bashin'
in
the
brains
of
these
hoes
and
establishin'
the
name
as
he
goes
The
passion
in
the
flame
is
ignited—you
can't
put
it
out
once
we
light
it
This
shit
is
exactly
what
the
fuck
that
I'm
talkin'
about
when
we
riot
You
dealin'
with
a
few
true
villains
who
stand
inside
of
a
booth,
truth-spillin'
And
spit
true
feelings
until
our
tooth-fillings
come
flyin'
up
outta
of
our
mouths—now,
rewind
it
Pay
back,
motherfucker,
for
the
way
that
you
got
at
me—how's
it
taste
When
I
slap
the
taste
outta
your
mouth
with
the
bass
so
loud
that
it
shakes
the
place?
I'm
Hannibal
Lecter,
so
just
in
case
you're
thinkin'
of
savin'
face
You
ain't
gonna
have
no
face
to
save
by
the
time
I'm
through
with
this
place,
so
Drake—
It
may
not
mean
nothin'
to
y'all
But
understand,
nothin'
was
done
for

So
I
don't
plan
on

I'm

Verse
1:]
I
want
you
to
understand
something
That
when
I
come
up
in
this
bitch,
I
want
them
fans
jumping
I
want
them
fists
pumping
in
the
air,
I
don't
look
like
a
millionaire
But
I
feel
like
a
million
bucks,
Ladies
won't
you
fill
your
cups?
Shady's
come
to
fill
you
up,
if
you
a
D
or
a
C-cup
You
can
even
be
a
B,
it's
just
me
and
D-R-E
You'll
be
in
the
E-R,
we
are
strapped
with
so
much
T-N-T
We
may
blow,
no,
not
even
C-P-R
from
the
EMT
Can
help
you
to
resuscitate,
You
bustas
must
be
flustered,
wait
You
can't
cut
the
mustard,
What's
your
problem,
can't
you
bust
a
grape?
(chk
chk)
What's
my
name?
Shady
came
to
crush
the
game
Instantly,
not
even
fair
to
them
cause
they
pale
in
comparisons
So
much
they
might
as
well
wear
a
skin,
don't
you
wish
you
could
just
share
his
pen?
Cause
this
shit
is
getting
embarrassing,
the
fog
is
thick
and
the
air
is
thin
Cause
he
won't
even
let
them
try
to
breathe,
Dadidadidadadi
He
makes
it
look
so
easy,
Girl
you
just
hit
the
lottery
[Eminem
-
Chorus:]
Now
this
would
be
the
part
of
the
song
Where
they
drop
the
meter
and
hell
breaks
loose
Try
to
restrain
us,
you
can't
contain
us
We
still
gonna
make
it
stick
no
matter
what
we
do
Everywhere
we
go,
it
seems
we
looking
For
any
excuse
to
just
cut
loose
So
this
would
be
the
part
of
the
song
Where
they
drop
the
meter
and
hell
breaks
loose

Dre

Verse
2:]
This
is
when
shit
hits
the
fan
like
it
just
flat
out
don't
stand
This
is
the
only
moment
that
matters,
your
homie
rolling
with
Mathers
Then
chaos
erupts,
Em's
in
back,
Dre's
in
the
front
So
do
what
we
say
and
once
it's
over
like
a
suance,
it
hums
(It
makes
them
stay
in
a
trance,
No
choice,
they
have
to
dance)
It's
like
the
playoffs,
just
making
sure
that
we
stay
in
the
hunt
Take
a
day
off
or
what?
Man,
you
better
lay
off
the
blunts
You
must
be
smokin'
something,
think
I
ain't
smokin'
nothing,
stay
off
my
nuts
Now
hit
the
floor,
baby,
time
to
wipe
away
all
the
rust
Shake
all
them
cobwebs
loose,
loosen
up
with
a
little
bit
of
Grey
Goose
Yeah,
girl,
shake
that
caboose,
I
don't
wanna
see
you
try
to
make
no
excuse
D-R-E
is
on
the
loose,
I'm
like
a
goose
when
it
comes
to
the
Chronic
use
You
know
I
can't
stand
to
lose,
Me
and
my
goons
are
like
animals
Wake
up
like
a
pack
of
wolves
and
we
came
here
to
extract
the
roof
Yeah,
man,
ain't
that
the
truth?
Girl,
your
mans
is
like
in
the
booth
Definitely
back
up
in
this
bitch,
You
swing?
All
hell
breaks
loose
[Chorus]
Now
this
would
be
the
part
of
the
song
Where
they
drop
the
meter
and
hell
breaks
loose
Try
to
restrain
us,
you
can't
contain
us
We
still
gonna
make
it
stick
no
matter
what
we
do
Everywhere
we
go,
it
seems
we
looking
For
any
excuse
to
just
cut
loose
So
this
would
be
the
part
of
the
song
Where
they
drop
the
meter
and
hell
breaks
loose

Verse
3:]
Now
I
know
your
feeling
discouraged
but
homie
just
mark
my
words
I'm
murdering
the
flow,
Liquid
courage
I'm
fitting
to
blow
As
soon
as
we
hit
the
door,
power
surges
head
to
toe
I'm
sure
to
push
it
as
far
as
words
are
meant
to
go
We're
in
the
indigo
Winnebago
with
tinted
windows
Ferocious
as
we
proceed
to
beat
up
the
block
with
your
hoe
With
speakers
knocking,
it's
3
o'clock,
me
and
Doc
Can
proceed
to
drop
me
and
hop
out
the
vehicle
and
knock
on
your
door
(Yeah,
So
let
us
in
before
we
huff
and
puff
and
we
blow
We
ain't
bluffing
for
nothing,
we'll
knock
the
stuffing
out
your
Revenge
is
so
sweet,
move
until
you
injure
your
feet
Yeah,
move
it
or
lose
it,
freak,
move
to
the
beat
Lose
yourself
indubitably
Pass
on
that
little
cute
chick
right
over
there,
That'd
be
pretty
damn
stupid
to
me
Born
and
raised
in
the
CPT,
yeah,
I'm
saying
?
in
the
streets
Them
haters
hating
on
me
but
I
refuse
to
lose
any
sleep
Keep
that
deuce
deuce
in
the
seat,
Dre
fall
off?
That's
news
to
me)
[20
seconds

"It

Who'da
knew
the
buddah
do
to
me
what

Such
cynicism
when
this
isn't
in
my
system
Blunt
hypnotism,
lift
the
spliff
up
to
my
lips
son
So
much
on
my
hands
I
got
to
give
my
kids
a
fist
bump
Christo-pher
Reeves
swimmin
in
my
swim
trunks
"Mister,
help
me"
's
what
he
said
to
me
and
then
sunk
Women
skinning
and
then
cutting
them
up
in
chunks
In
comes
the
woman
with
cocoa
butter
skin
once
[Chorus:
Eminem]
Once
again
they
call
me
Buffalo
Bill
Buffalo
Bill,
Buffa-Buffalo
Bill
Skin
'em
up,
hem
'em,
sew
'em
up
in
those
kilts
Up
in
those
kilts,
uppa-up
in
those
kilts
Man
you
don't
want
to
go
up
in
those
hills
Up
in
those
hills,
uppa-up
in
those
hills
You
better
beware,
stay
clear
of
Buffalo
Bill
Buffalo
Bill,
Buffa-Buffalo
Bill
[Eminem]
Always,
you
can
see
him
lurkin
in
the
hallways
Carcasses
of
Caucasian
females
in
his
crawl
space
How
the
hell
did
he
fit
'em
all
into
such
a
small
place
Hide
'em
in
the
wall,
well
how
long
will
the
drywall
take?
Well
fuck
it
then,
I
got
nothing
but
time,
I'll
wait
Until
it
dries
for
the
moment
I
guess
you're
all
safe
After
I
sand
it
and
buff
it
I
guess
that
I'll
paint
My
chainsaw's
out
of
gas,
my
regular
saw
ain't
Now
here
I
come
again,
damn
stomach
rumblin
You
can
even
hear
the
evil
spirits
comin
from
within
Someone's
in,
the
back
of
my
damn
house
rummagin
It's
a
girl,
she
looks
pretty
thin,
but
I
want
to
skin
Been,
on
the
hunt
again;
when,
will
it
ever
end?
Evelyn,
why
you
tryin
to
fight?
You
will
never
win
Severin,
legs,
arms,
damn
there
goes
another
limb
Pull
the
lever
then,
trapdoor,
death
is
evident
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Now
what
you
know
about
Buffalo
Bill?
Nothin
so
chill
Fuckin
whore
you
better
fuckin
hold
still
Make
sure
none
of
that,
lotion
in
the
bucket
don't
spill
Cut
'em,
gut
'em
and
just
keep
to
stuffin
those
girls
Man
I
think
she
had
enough
of
those
pills
Sedate
her
then
I'll
wait,
I'll
come
back
later
just
to
clutch
on
those
steel
Blades,
baby
when
I
cut
ya
don't
squeal
I
hate
the
loud
noises,
I
fuckin
told
you!
I
keep
hearin
voices
like
wouldn't
ya
like
to
go
and
get
your
butcher
knife
And
push
it
right
through
her
while
you
put
ya
shish-kabob
skewers
Into
her,
barbecue
her
or
would
you
do
to
her
What
you
usually
do
to
a
girl
who's
skin's
newer?
[as
Yoda]
"In
a
world
of

you

Torment

I'll

Boo-yah,

[Intro:

All

Okay
Next

my
basement,
ha
ha
I'll
meet
you
down

[Chorus:
Eminem]
There
once
was
a
saying
that,
I
used
to
say
Back
in
the
day
when,
I
met
Dre
I
used
to
sit
and
goof
on
the
phone
with,
my
friend
Proof
That
if
I
went
gold,
I'd
go
right
through
the
roof
He'd
say
"What
if
you
went
platinum?"
I'll
just
laugh
at
him
That's,
not
happenin,
that
I
can't
fathom
Eighty-somethin
million
records
worldwide
later
I'm
living,
in
a
house
with
a
fuckin
elevator
[Verse

Haters
gettin
mad,
they
done
had
enough
of
Shady
You
slay
me,
nothin
you

Rappers

Ukelele
Whoops-e-dada

no-no,
even
She
knows
that
I's
fucking
crazy
Fuckin'
animal,
cookoo
for
bananas,
fuckin'
A
B
Maybe
its
because
I
never
had
a
mother
raise
me,
Fuck
around
and
throw
a
baby
at
another
baby
You
may
think
it's
cuz'
the
way
that
I
was
Brought
up,
but
it's
all
caught
up
to
me
now,
Karma's
in
the
waters
Every
line
I
ever
said
has
got
me
in
a
corner,
You
might
think
it
doesn't
creep
up
on
ya
but
it
All
does
You
wouldn't
listen
man,
I
tried
to
warn
ya
when
Ya
started
Now
ya
brain's
all
horny,
cuz
of
all
the
shit
ya
Thought
of
Chainsaw
slaughters
turn
your
daughters
into
Sawdust
I
never
thought
it
would
come
to

It

right?
But
it's
alright!

It's
okay
with
me!
I'll
do
my
steps
all
by
myself,
I
don't
need
no-body
to
play
with
me;
But
if
you
just
give
me
a
chance,
I
can
put
you
in
a
trance
the
way
I
dance!
But
don't
nobody
wanna
play
with
me
so,
I'm
taking
my

Hooome!
[Verse

I'm
that

man!
-
Shove
a
diamond
up
my
hind
end,
And
crush
it
with
my
butt-muscles
while
I
cut
vocals.
Slut,
poke
holes
in
your
shirt
jump
in
mud
puddles,
While
I
stomp
mudholes
in
your
ass
girl,
now
let's
cuddle!
Blood
curdlin',
you're
gurglin'
on
your
blood,
what'll
I
do
for
my
next
trick?
-
I'm
feeling
wonder-ful!
I
think
I
might
just
do
something
a
little
less
subtle,
Shove
a
fucking
Tonka
truck
up
a
little
kids
butthole!
(Ooooh!)
Feel
the
wrath
of
a
psychopath
slash
Ambassador,
Of
the
"Valentine's
Day
Massacre"!
Slash
assassin,
I
slash
her
in
ass
with
a'
Icicle
and
leave
her
in
a
blood
bath
while
I,
Put
a
catheter
in
-
and
jump
in
the
bath
with
her,
In
my
Spider-Man
mask
just
imagine
The
fun
I
can
have
with
a
strap
on!
Stick
it
up
a
Kim
Kardashian's
ass
and
make
the
bitch
run
a
triathlon!
(hahaa!)
Are
those
pistachios?
Damn,
I'd
like
to
have
some,
Layin'
on
the
patio,
man
rolling
a
fat
one!
Shady
drop
the
magic
marker
put
the
cap

Goddamn
man!
Are
you
that
much
of
an
asshole?
(ooookay!)
[Chorus]
[Verse
2:]
I'm
like
Houdini!
-
Tuck
my
teeny,
eenie-weenie
between
each
One
of
my
thighs
and
make
it
disappear
like
a
genie!
Make
this
shit
disappear
like
Tara
Reid
in
a
bikini,
(oooh-hooo!)
Believe
me
homie!
you
don't
know
the
meaning
of
a
meanie!
They
call
me
the
fruit
loop
from
Jupiter,
I'm
tryna
maneuver
the
Hoover
up
in
your
poop
shoot,
don't
move,
or
ya
Might
get
it
stuck
so
fuckin'
far
up
in
your
uvula,
You
ain't
gonna
know
what
he
was
tryna
do
to
your
gluteus!
(whooo,

Totally
tubular,
sniffin'
glue
through
a
tube
in
the
studio,
Now

Weenier's
smothered
in
peanut
butter,
pudding
on
the
"tube"
of
"your,
Eye
shadow
and
man

looked
nice!
-
You
shoulda
seen
it
mother!
I
think
I'll
put
a
piece
of
art
on
my
Visa
card,
Then
I'll
go
beat
Mischa
Barton
with
a
Cuisinart!
And
mosey

Rosie
O'Donnell's,
With
McDonald's!
-
Jump

lap
and
watch
"The
Sopranos"!
(ooookay!)
[Chorus]
[Verse

"Shady

Chewin'

Grab

And

Usin'
the

vacuumin'
a
raccoon!
Skewin'
a

You

"
You

ain't
leave
you
full
of

wounds,
You

I'm
back
doing
my
dance,

But

Sarah
Palin
by

hair
and
Make
her
wear
a
bathin'
suit
and
take
her
parasailin'!
(ha-ha!)
Shady
what
do
you
gotta
pick
on
the
lady
for?
Why
you
make
her
read
eighty-four
bed
time
stories
to
you
in
baby
talk?
"Cause
I'm
scared,
there's
monsters
under
my
bed!
Kelly
Pickler
hid
my
juicebox
under
my
bassinet!
No
wonder
my
ass
is
wet,
my
diaper
needs
to
be
changed,
Do
you
like
graffiti,
dyke?
Well,
I
can
pee-pee
and
write
your
name!
"
(ooookay!)
[Chorus]
[Outro:]
Fine!
Nobody
wants
to
play
with
me?
Fuck
you
then...
bitch!
Guys
are
always
mean
to
me
anyways!
All
you
ever
do
is
rub
gum
in
my
hair...
stuff!
You
guys
are
going
to
make
me...
make
sad!
I'm
sad!
I'm
gonna
cry!
I'm
crying!
Huhh-huhhh!
I
wanna
tell
my
mom!
MOOOOOMMMMMM!
Yeah
Yeah,
girl
Can
you
hear
that?
It's
playing
our
song
Are
you
sleepy?
Take
a
nap
You're
not
afraid
of
the
dark,
are
you?
You
hear
the
beat
as
it
makes
you
not
want
to
go
to
sleep
I
knock
on
Dakota's
door,
it's
locked,
so
I
go
to
creep
'Round
the
back
with
binoculars,
not
'cause
I
wanna
peep
But
because
I'm
hungry,
she
smells
like
tacos,
I
wanna
eat
Visions
of
hot
chocolaty
marshmallows,
all
so
sweet
With
sugar
plums,
oh
look
here
comes
Marshall,
he's
on
your
street
He's
placing
hot
smoldering
charcoals
beneath
your
feet
Now
walk
on
'em,
he's
dancing
with
carcasses
cheek
to
cheek
Like
a
Thanksgiving
turkey,
a
holiday
ham
Cinnamon
sprinkled
on
toast,
strawberry
marmalade
jam
Flavor
my
favorite
graham
crackers
with
JonBenét
Rams'
I
guess
a
modern-day
Jack
the
Ripper
is
all
that
I
am
(My
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl's
asleep
(My
music
box)
But
I
can
hear
you,
my
love,
you
keep
calling
me
(My
music
box)
Although
we're
worlds
apart,
you
mean
the
world
to
me
(My
music
box)
So
once
you
call,
I
come,
I
will
answer
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl’s
asleep
(My
music
box)
I
hear
my
music
box
playing
a
song
for
me
(My
music
box)
So
won’t
you
twirl
around
and
do
a
whirl
for
me?
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
And
would
you
be
my
private
little
dancer?
I
almost
look
comatose,
who
wants
to
be
sober?
Gross
I
foam
like
a
Doberman,
mouth
open,
I
overdose
Put
coke
up
my
nostrils
in
both
my
holes,
then
I
plug
my
nose
My
pupils
quadruple
in
size,
eyes
are
so
bugged,
I
know
I
put
on
my
mother's
makeup,
get
naked,
and
run
around
Waving
the
gun
around,
I
think
I'm
down
to
a
hundred
pounds
There's
thunder,
I
wonder
how
come
it
rains,
but
the
sun
is
out?
The
devil's
upset
with
his
wife,
they
must
be
sluggin'
it
out
I
must
be
buggin'
the
fuck
out,
but
what
the
fuck
about?
Voices
are
leading
me
up
to
the
attic,
I
love
my
house
They
pull
and
they
tug
my
blouse,
the
sound
of
a
music
box
Comes
from
inside
a
toy
chest,
but
what
do
I
do?
It's
locked
I
pick
it
and
open
it,
but
it's
stuffed
full
of
human
parts
I
dig
'til
I
find
it,
I
wind
it
up,
and
the
tune
just
starts
It's
playing
a
song
so
beautiful,
and
the
room
is
dark
The
moon
is
full,
I
smell
a
funeral,
guess
I'll
loom
in
the
park
(My
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl's
asleep
(My
music
box)
But
I
can
hear
you,
my
love,
you
keep
calling
me
(My
music
box)
Although
we're
worlds
apart,
you
mean
the
world
to
me
(My
music
box)
So
once
you
call,
I
come,
I
will
answer
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl’s
asleep
(My
music
box)
I
hear
my
music
box
playing
a
song
for
me
(My
music
box)
So
won’t
you
twirl
around
and
do
a
whirl
for
me?
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
And
would
you
be
my
private
little
dancer?
I'm
fixated
on
asphyxiatin'
and
breakin'
this
little
chick's
neck
like
a
Pixy
Stick
The
sick,
Satan-worshippin'
bitches
get
horse
whippings
I'm
in
the
back,
through
the
back
door
slippin'
Through
the
crack,
leavin'
the
corpse
drippin'
The
mortician
of
love,
sent
from
above
Forced
entry,
the
more
wenchy
the
more
stingy
I
become
Been
doing
this
for
more
than
a
quarter-century,
I'm
just
numb
Am
I
dreaming,
is
it
real?
Someone
pinch
me
on
the
buns
The
time
has
come
to
tie
her
up,
gotta
roll
me
the
ladder
I've
had
enough
of
the
chatter,
climb
up
to
the
window,
look
at
her
Then
climb
in
slow
to
shatter
her
brain
matter
and
batter
her
With
a
bat—a
matter
of
fact,
that
will
splatter
her
But
before
I
do
that,
I'll
have
a
chat
to
flatter
her
Give
her
two
compliments
back
to
back
like,
"Tabitha
I'm
your
secret
admirer,
I'm
back
to
ravish
ya
So
strong
is
your
fight,
but
you're
no
match
for
Dracula"
Prolonging
her
plight
as
I
go
back
to
stabbin'
her
Dismember
her
limbs,
simple
as
that:
cadaver
her
Zoom
in
with
the
lens,
then
pan
back
the
camera
Stand
back,
'cause
here
comes
your
man,
Jack,
so
Pamela
(My
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl's
asleep
(My
music
box)
But
I
can
hear
you,
my
love,
you
keep
calling
me
(My
music
box)
Although
we're
worlds
apart,
you
mean
the
world
to
me
(My
music
box)
So
once
you
call,
I
come,
I
will
answer
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
'Cause
when
the
lights
are
off,
I
see
the
girl’s
asleep
(My
music
box)
I
hear
my
music
box
playing
a
song
for
me
(My
music

So
won’t
you
twirl
around
and
do
a
whirl
for
me?
(My
music
box,
my
music
box)
And
would
you
be
my
private

the
grapes
and
grow
a
pair
But
I
swear,
you
try
to
diss
me,
I'll
slaughter
you
I
put
that
on
everything,
like
everyone
does
with
auto-tune
That
last
thing
you
wanna
do
is
have
me
spit
out
a
rhyme
And
say
I
was
writing
this
and
I
thought
of
you
so
Oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh,
I'm
as
cold
as
the
cold
wind
blows
When
it
snows
and
it's
twenty
be-low
Ask
me
why
man
I
just
don't
know
know
know
know
know
know
know
I'm
as
cold
as
the
cold
wind
blows
blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
(Outro)
Oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
oh
I
don't
know,
I
don't
know
what
caused,
I
don't
know
what
caused
me
to
be
this
wayme
to
be
this
way
I
don't
know,
I
don't
know
by
I
probably
be
this
way
til
my
dying
day
I
don't
know
why
I'm
so,
I'm
so
cold
beat
bangs,
I
don't
need
to
say
I
guess
this
is
how
you
made
me
(Grazie

Marco

(Intro)
Ayo,
before
i
start
this
song
man,
I
just
wanna
thank
everyone
for
being
so
patient
And
bearing
with
me
over
the
past
few
years
while
I
figure
this
shit
out
(Hook)
Is
anybody
out
there,
It
feels
like
I'm
talking
to
myself
No
one
seems
to
know
my
struggle,
and
everything
I
come
from
Can
anybody
hear
me
yeah,
I
guess
I
keep
talking
to
myself
Feels
like
I'm
going
insane,
am
I
the
one
who's
crazy
So
why
in
the
world
do
I
feel
so
alone
Nobody
but
me,
I'm
on
my
own
Is
there
anyone
out
there,
who
feels
the
way
I
feel
That
there
is
and
let
me
know
so
I
know
that
I'm
not
the
only
one
(Verse
1)
I
went
away
I
guess
that
opened
up
some
lanes
But
there
was
no
one
who
even
knew
I
was
going
through
growing
pains
Hatred
was
flowing
through
my
veins,
on
the
verge
of
going
insane
I
almost
made
a
song
dissing
Lil
Wayne
It's
like
I
was
jealous
of
him,
cause
of
the
attention
he
was
getting
I
felt
horrible
about
myself,
he
was
spitting
and
I
wasn't
Anyone
who
was
buzzing
back
then
could
of
got
it
Almost
went
at
Kanye
too,
god
it
feels
like
I'm
going
psychotic
Thank
god
that
I
didn't
do
it
I'd
of
had
my
ass
handed
to
me,
and
I
knew
it
But
proof
isn't
here
to
see
me
through
it
I'm
in
the
booth
popping
another
pill,
tryna
talk
myself
into
it
Are
you
stupid?
You
gon'
start
dissing
people
for
no
reason
Especially
when
you
can't
even
write
a
decent
punchline
even
You're
lying
to
yourself,
you're
slowing
dying
You're
denying,
your
health
is
declining
with
your
self
esteem
you're
crying
out
for
help
(Hook)
Is
anybody
out
there,
It
feels
like
I'm
talking
to
myself
No
one
seems
to
know
my
struggle,
and
everything
I
come
from
Can
anybody
hear
me
yeah,
I
guess
I
keep
talking
to
myself
Feels
like
I'm
going
insane,
am
I
the
one
who's
crazy
So
why
in
the
world
do
I
feel
so
alone
Nobody
but
me,
I'm
on
my
own
Is
there
anyone
out
there,
who
feels
the
way
I
feel
That
there
is
and
let
me
know
so
I
know
that
I'm
not
the
only
one
(Verse
2)
Marshall,
you're
no
longer
the
man,
that's
a
bitter
pill
to
swallow
All
I
know
is
I'm
wallowing,
self-loathing
and
hollow
Bottoms
up
on
the
pill
bottle,
maybe
I
hit
my
bottom
tomorrow
My
sorrow
echos
in
this
hall
though
But
I
must
be
talking
to
the
wall
though,
I
don't
see
nobody
else
(I
guess
I
keep
talking
to
myself)
But
all
these
other
rappers
suck
is
all
that
I
know
I've
turned
into
a
hater,
I
put
up
a
false
mavado
But
Marshall
is
not
an
egomaniac,
that's
not
his
motto
He's
not
a
desperado,
he's
desperate,
his
thoughts
are
bottled
Inside
him,
one
foot
on
the
brake,
one
of
the
throttle
Falling
asleep
with
writers
block
in
the
parking
lot
of
Mcdonalds
But
instead
of
feeling
sorry
for
yourself,
do
something
about
it
Admit
you
got
a
problem,
your
brain
is
clouded
You're
powdered
long
enough,
It
isn't
them,
its
you,
you
fucking
baby
Quit
worrying
bout
what
they
do
and
do
Shady,
I'm
fucking
going
crazy
(Hook)
Is
anybody
out
there,
It
feels
like
I'm
talking
to
myself
No
one
seems
to
know
my
struggle,
and
everything
I
come
from
Can
anybody
hear
me
yeah,
I
guess
I
keep
talking
to
myself
Feels
like
I'm
going
insane,
am
I
the
one
who's
crazy
So
why
in
the
world
do
I
feel
so
alone
Nobody
but
me,
I'm
on
my
own
Is
there
anyone
out
there,
who
feels
the
way
I
feel
That
there
is
and
let
me
know
so
I
know
that
I'm
not
the
only
one
(Verse
3)
So
I
picked
myself
up
off
the
ground,
and
fucking
swam
before
I
drowned
Hit
my
bottom
so
hard
I
bounced
twice,
advice
this
time
around
It's
different,
them
last
2
albums
didn't
count
Encore
I
was
on
drugs,
Relapse
I
was
flushing
'em
out
I've
come
to
make
it
up
to
you,
now
no
more
fucking
around
I
got
something
to
prove
to
fans
cause
I
feel
like
I
let
'em
down
So
please
accept
my
apology,
I
finally
feel
like
I'm
back
to
normal
I
feel
like
me
again,
let
me
formally
re-introduce
myself
To
you
for
those
of
you
who
don't
know
The
new
me's
back
to
the
old
me,
and
homie
I
don't
show
no
Signs
of
slowing
or
bowing,
I'm
blowing
up
all
over
My
life
is
no
longer
a
movie,
but
the
show
ain't
over
homos
I'm
back
with
a
vengeance
homie,
Weezy
keep
your
head
up
T.I.
keep
your
head
up,
Kanye
keep
your
head
up
Don't
let
up,
just
keep
slaying
em
Rest
in
peace
to
DJ
AM,
cause
I
know
what
this
shit
is
like
I
struggle
with
this
shit
every
single
day
and
I'm
(Hook)
Is
anybody
out
there,
It
feels
like
I'm
talking
to
myself
No
one
seems
to
know
my
struggle,
and
everything
I
come
from
Can
anybody

yeah,
I

I
keep

Feels
like

and

so
I

I'm
not
the
only
one
(Outro)
So
there
it
is,
damn,
feels
like
i
just
woke
up
or
something
Guess
I
just
forgot
who
the
fuck
I
was
man
Ayo,
and
to
anybody
I
thought
about
going
at,
It
was
never
nothing
personal
Just
some
shit
that
I
was
going
through
And
to
the
rest
of
you,
I'm
back!

I'm
going
through
changes
I'm
going
through
changes
[Eminem]
Lately
I
really,
feel
like
I'm
rolling
for
__
like
Philly,
I
feel
like
I'm
losing
control
of
myself,
I
sincerely,
I
apologize
if
all
that
I
sound
like,
is
I'm
complaining,
But
life
keeps
on
complicating,
an'
I'm
debating,
On
leaving
this
world,
this
evening,
even
my
girls,
Can
see
I'm
grievin',
I
try
and
hide
it,
But
I
can't,
why
do
I
act
like
I'm
all
high
and
mighty,
When
inside,
I'm
dying,
I
am
finally
realizing
I
need
help.
I
can't
do
it
by
myself,
too
weak,
2
weeks
I've
been
having
ups
and
downs,
Going
through
peaks
and
valleys,
dilly
dallying,
Around
with
the
idea,
of
ending
the
shit
right
here.
I'm
hatin'
my
reflection,
I
walk
around
the
house
tryin'
to
fight
mirrors,
I
can't
stand
what
I
look
like,
yeah,
I
look
fat,
but
what
do
I
care?
I
give
a
fuck,
only
thing
I
fear,
is
Hailie,
I'm
afraid
if
I
close
my
eyes
I
might
see
her,
Shit..
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
I
lock
myself
in
the
bedroom,
bathroom,
nappin'
at
noon,
Yeah
dad's
in
a
bad
mood,
he's
always
snappin'
at
you.
Marshall
what
happened
at
you,
you
can't
stop
with
these
pills,
And
you've
fallen
off
with
your
skills,
and
your
own
fans
are
laughin'
at
you.
It
become
a
problem
you're
too
pussy
to
tackle,
get
up,
Be
a
man,
stand,
a
real
man
woulda
had
this
shit
handled.
Know
you
just
had
your
heart
ripped
out
and
crushed,
They
say
Proof
just
flipped
out,
homie
just
swift
out
and
bust,
Nah,
it
ain't
like
Doody
to
do
that,
He
wouldn't
fuckin'
shoot
at,
no-body,
he
fights
first,
But
dwellin'
on
it
only
makes
the
night
worse,
Now
I'm
poppin
Vic's,
perks
and
Methadone
pills.
Yeah
Em,
tight
verse,
you
killed
it,
Fuckin'
drug
dealers
hang
around
me
like
"yes
man",
And
they
gon'
do
whatever
I
says
when,
I
says
it,
It's
in
their
best
interest
to
protect
their
investment.
And
I
just
lost
my
fuckin'
best
friend,
so
fuck
it,
I
guess
then...
[Chorus]
Don't
know
what
I'm
going
through,
but
I
just
keep
on
going
through
changes...
My
friends
just
can't
understand
this
new
me,
That's
understandable
man,
but
just
think
how
bananas
you'd
be,
You'd
be
an
animal
too,
if
you
were
trapped
in
this
fame
and
caged
in
it
like
a
zoo.
And
everybody's
lookin'
at
you,
what
you
want
me
to
do,
I'm
startin'
to
live
like
a
recluse
and
the
truth
is,
Fame
startin'
to
give
me
an
excuse,
to
be
at
a
all
time
low.
I
sit
alone
in
my
home
theatre,
watchin'
the
same
damn
DVD,
Of
the
first
tour,
the
last
tour,
he
was
still
alive.
And
it
hurt
sore,
fast
forward,
sleepin'
pills'll
make
me
feel
alright.
And
if
I'm
still
awake
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
I
just
take
a
couple
more,
yeah
you're
motherfuckin'
right,
I
ain't
slowin'
down
for
no
one,
I
am
almost
homeward
bound.
Almost
in
a
coma,
yeah
homie
come
on,
don't
look
now,
Daddy,
don't
you
die
on
me,
daddy,
better
hold
your
ground.
Fuck,
don't
I
know
the
sound
of
that
voice,
Yeah
baby
hold
me
down.
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Wake
up
in
the
hospital,
full
of
tubes,
plus
somehow
I'm
pullin'
through.
Swear
when
I
come
back
I'ma
be
bulletproof.
I'ma
do
it
just
for
Proof,
I
think
I
should
state
a
few,
Facts,
cause
I
may
not
get
a
chance
again
to
say
the
truth.
Shit
it
just
hit
me
that
what
if
I
would
notta
made
it
through?
I
think
about
the
things
I
would
never
got
to
say
to
you,
I'd
never
get
to
make
it
right,
so
here's
what
I
came
to
do.
Hailie
this
one
is
for
you,
Whitney
and
Alaina
too,
I
still
love
your
mother,
that'll
never
change,
Think
about
her
every
day,
we
just
could
never
get
it
together.
Hey,
wish
there
was
a
better
way,
for
me
to
say
it,
But
I
swear
on
everything,
I'd
do
anything
for
her
on
any
day.
There
are
just
too
many
things,
to
explain,
when
it
rains,
Guess
it
pours,
yes
it
does,
wish
there
wasn't
any
pain.
But
I
can't
pretend
there
ain't,
I
ain't
placin'
any
blame,
I
ain't
pointin'
fingers,
heaven
knows
there
never
been
a
saint.
I
know
it
just
feels
like
we
just
pissed
away
our
history,
But
just
today,
I
looked
at
your
picture,
almost
hate
to
say,
I
miss
you
self
consciously,
wish
it
didn't
end
this
way.
But
I
just
had
to
get
away,
don't
know
why,
I
don't
know
what
else
to
say,
I
guess
I'm..
[Chorus]
Yeah,
it's
been
a
ride
I
guess
I
had
to
go
to
that
place
to
get
to
this
one
Now
some
of
you
might
still
be
in
that
place
If
you're
tryin'
to
get
out
Just
follow
me,
I'll
get
you
there
You
can
try
and
read
my
lyric
off
of
this
paper
before
I
lay
'em
But
you
won't
take
the
sting
out
these
words
before
I
say
'em
'Cause
ain't
no
way
I'ma
let
you
stop
me
from
causin'
mayhem
When
I
say
I'ma
do
somethin',
I
do
it,
I
don't
give
a
damn
What
you
think,
I'm
doin'
this
for
me,
so
fuck
the
world
Feed
it
beans,
it's
gassed
up
if
it
thinks
it's
stoppin'
me
I'ma
be
what
I
set
out
to
be,
without
a
doubt,
undoubtably
And
all
those
who
look
down
on
me
I'm
tearin'
down
your
balcony
No
ifs,
ands
or
buts,
don't
try
to
ask
him
why
or
"how
can
he"
From
Infinite
down
to
the
last
Relapse
album,
he's
Still
shittin',
whether
he's
on
salary,
paid
hourly
Until
he
bows
out
or
he
shits
his
bowels
out
of
him
Whichever
comes
first,
for
better
or
worse
He's
married
to
the
game
Like
a
"fuck
you"
for
Christmas:
his
gift
is
a
curse
Forget
the
Earth,
he's
got
the
urge
to
pull
his
dick
from
the
dirt
And
fuck
the
whole
Universe
I'm
not
afraid
to
take
a
stand
Everybody,
come
take
my
hand
We'll
walk
this
road
together,
through
the
storm
Whatever
weather,
cold
or
warm
Just
lettin'
you
know
that
you're
not
alone
Holla
if
you
feel
like
you've
been
down
the
same
road
Okay,
quit
playin'
with
the
scissors
and
shit,
and
cut
the
crap
I
shouldn't
have
to
rhyme
these
words
in
a
rhythm
For
you
to
know
it's
a
wrap
You
said
you
was
king,
you
lied
through
your
teeth
For
that,
fuck
your
feelings
Instead
of
gettin'
crowned
you're
gettin'
capped
And
to
the
fans,
I'll
never
let
you
down
again,
I'm
back
I
promise
to
never
go
back
on
that
promise
In
fact,
let's
be
honest,
that
last
Relapse
CD
was
ehhhh
Perhaps
I
ran
them
accents
into
the
ground
Relax,
I
ain't
goin'
back
to
that
now
All
I'm
tryin'
to
say
is
get
back,
click-clack
BLAOW
Cause
I
ain't
playin'
around
There's
a
game
called
circle
and
I
don't
know
how
I'm
way
too
up
to
back
down
But
I
think
I'm
still
tryin'
to
figure
this
crap
out
Thought
I
had
it
mapped
out
But
I
guess
I
didn't,
this
fuckin'
black
cloud
Still
follows
me
around,
but
it's
time
to
exorcise
these
demons
These
muh'fuckers
are
doin'
jumpin'
jacks
now
I'm
not
afraid
to
take
a
stand
Everybody,
come
take
my
hand
We'll
walk
this
road
together,
through
the
storm
Whatever
weather,
cold
or
warm
Just
lettin'
you
know
that
you're
not
alone
Holla
if
you
feel
like
you've
been
down
the
same
road
And
I
just
can't
keep
livin'
this
way
So
startin'
today,
I'm
breakin'
out
of
this
cage
I'm
standin'
up,
I'ma
face
my
demons
I'm
mannin'
up,
I'ma
hold
my
ground
I've
had
enough,
now
I'm
so
fed
up
Time
to
put
my
life
back
together
right
now
It
was
my
decision
to
get
clean,
I
did
it
for
me
Admittedly
I
probably
did
it
subliminally
for
you
So
I
could
come
back
a
brand-new
me
You
helped
see
me
through
And
don't
even
realize
what
you
did,
believe
me
you
I've
been
through
the
wringer
But
they
can
do
little
to
the
middle
finger
I
think
I
got
a
tear
in
my
eye,
I
feel
like
the
king
of
My
world,
haters
can
make
like
bees
with
no
stingers
And
drop
dead:
no
more
beef
flingers
No
more
drama
from
now
on,
I
promise
To
focus
solely
on
handlin'
my
responsibilities
as
a
father
So
I
solemnly
swear
to
always
treat
this
roof
like
my
daughters
And
raise
it,
you
couldn't
lift
a
single
shingle
on
it
Cause
the
way
I
feel,
I'm
strong
enough
to
go
to
the
club
Or
the
corner
pub
and
lift
the
whole
liquor
counter
up
Cause
I'm
raisin'
the
bar
I'd
shoot
for
the
moon,
but
I'm
too
busy
gazin'
at
stars
I
feel
amazin',
and
I'm
I'm
not
afraid
to
take
a
stand
Everybody,
come
take
my
hand
We'll
walk
this
road
together,
through
the
storm
Whatever
weather,
cold
or
warm
Just
lettin'
you
know
that
you're
not
alone
Holla
if
you
feel
like
you've
been
down
the
same
road
(Intro)
I
dunno
man,
just
feels
like,
well
alot
different
Kinda
feels
like,
I'm
on
a
whole
different
page
right
now
Feels
strange
but
um,
I
guess
it's
kinda
like...
it's
kinda
like
(Verse
1)
I
feel
like
I'm
morphin,
into
something
so
indcredible,
that
I'm
dwarfin'
All
competetors,
better
get
your
girlfriend
in
check
It's
psychological
warfare,
endorphin
side-effect
Your
self
esteem
shatters
his
dialect
Comes
blasting
out
your
deck,
she
loves
me
So
much
passion
you'd
expect
this
sort
reaction
from
her
yet
Your
strong
oh,
you're
fucking
corny,
you
try
to
turn
your
charm
on
Cause
you
just
think
you're
Bishop
the
don
one
But
if
you
think
you're
fucking
with
me,
homie
you're
on
one
I'm
cockin'
my
head
back
like
'Ed
Lover,
come
on
son
She's
on
my
johnson,
she
brings
my
name
up
constant
Your
boys
are
like
"she's
fucking
with
dude,
she
wants
son"
Homeboy,
you
better
get
a
clue
She's
on
my
dick
cause
I
spit
better
than
you
What
you
expect
her
to
do?
How
you
expect
her
to
act
in
the
sack
When
she's
closing
her
eyes,
fantasizing
of
digging
her
nails
in
my
back
to
this
track
(Hook)
Seduction,
seduce
Ain't
nobody
who's
as
good
at
what
I
do
Cause
one
minute
she
loves
you,
the
next
she
don't
She's
been
stolen
from
you
Seduction,
seduce
Ain't
nobody
who's
as
good
at
what
I
do
Cause
one
minute
she
loves
you,
the
next
she
don't
She's
been
stolen
from
you
(Verse
2)
She's
sitting
there
getting
liquored
up
at
the
bar
She
says
it's
quicker
to
count
the
things
that
ain't
wrong
with
you
Than
to
count
the
things
that
are
There's
a
seven
disc,
CD
changer
in
her
car
And
I'm
in
every
single
slot,
and
you're
not,
awww
I'm
the
logo
on
that
Dallas
Cowboy
helmet,
a
star
And
I'm
not
about
to
sick
back
and
just
keep
rhyming
one
syllable,
nah
Switch
it
up
and
watch
them
haters
not
give
it
up,
cause
they're
just
not
good
enough
But
I'm
not
giving
up
til
I
get
my
respect,
and
I
won't
stop
til
I
get
enough
Cause
I'm
not
living
up
to
my
own
expectations,
aww
That
hater
alarm
is
sounding
off,
and
Obama
took
the
bomb
from
my
name,
aww
So
quit
crying
that
I
took
your
dame,
homie
she's
my
dame,
aww
You
sadly
mistaken
if
you
thinkin'
that
I'm
not
on
my
game
boy
And
things
just
ain't
been
the
same
since
the
day
that
I
came
for
it
You
wear
your
heart
on
your
sleeve,
I
sport
that
white
tank
boy
But
you
got
a
hard
on
for
me,
what
you
hollerin'
my
name
for?
It's
your
bitch
on
my
dick,
ain't
my
dang
fault,
man
I
can't
call
it
(Hook)
Seduction,
seduce
Ain't
nobody
who's
as
good
at
what
I
do
Cause
one
minute
she
loves
you,
the
next
she
don't
She's
been
stolen
from
you
Seduction,
seduce
Ain't
nobody
who's
as
good
at
what
I
do
Cause
one
minute
she
loves
you,
the
next
she
don't
She's
been
stolen
from
you
(Verse
3)
It's
like
we're
playing
lyrical
tug
of
war
with
your
ear
You
hear
it,
girl
come
here,
put
your
ear
up
to
the
speaker
Dear,
while
I
freak
this
world
premier
Seducing
her,
loosen
up
with
a
little
freestyle
Wait,
am
I
losing
ya?
Am
I
making
you
look
bad?
Well
I
got
news
for
ya
homie,
you're
losing
her
Oh
wait
she
don't
like
when
I
spit
it
fast
Am
I
tryna
show
how,
let
me
slow
it
down
It's
still
gonna
be
a
blowout
You're
gonna
wanna
throw
out
your
whole
album
Rummage
through
the
shit
and
try
to
salvage
something
To
see
if
you
can
save
any
of
it
punk,
but
none
of
it's
fucking
with
me
Prick
you
really
feeling
that
bullshit?
You
think
you
killing
them
syllables?
quit
playing
These
beats
ain't
nothing
to
fool
with
They
call
me
fire
Marshall,
I
shut
the
shit
down
Your
entire
arsenal
is
not
enough
to
fuck
with
one
round
I
am
also
the
opposite
of
what
you
are
like
You're
a
microcosm
of
what
the
fuck
I
am
on
the
mic
I
am
awesome,
and
you
are
just
awe-struck
She's
love-stricken,
she's
got
her
jaw
stuck
From
sucking
my
dick,
aww
fuck
(Hook)
Seduction,
seduce
Ain't
nobody
who's
as
good
at
what
I
do
Cause
one
minute
she
loves
you,
the
next
she
don't
She's
been
stolen
from
you
Seduction,
seduce
Ain't
nobody
who's
as
good
at
what
I
do
Cause
one
minute
she
loves
you,
the
next
she
don't
She's
been
stolen
from
you

[Verse

Lil
Wayne]
Throw
dirt
on
me
and
grow
a
wildflower
But
it's
"fuck
the
world",
get
a
child
out
her
Yeah,
my
life
a
bitch,
but
you
know
nothing
bout
her
Been
to
hell
and
back,
I
can
show
you
vouchers
I'm
rolling
Sweets,
I'm
smoking
sour
Married
to
the
game
but
she
broke
her
vows
That's
why
my
bars
are
full
of
broken
bottles
And
my
night
stands
are
full
of
open
Bibles
I
think
about
more
than
I
forget
But
I
don't
go
around
fire
expecting
not
to
sweat
And
these
niggas
know
I
lay
them
down,
make
their
bed
Bitches
try
to
kick
me
while
I'm
down:
I'll
break
your
leg
Money
outweighing
problems
on
the
triple
beam
I'm
sticking
to
the
script,
you
niggas
skipping
scenes
Be
good
or
be
good
at
it
Fucking
right
I've
got
my
gun,
semi-Cartermatic
Yeah,
put
a
dick
in
their
mouth,
so
I
guess
it's
"fuck
what
they
say"
I'm
high
as
a
bitch:
up,
up
and
away
Man,
I
come
down
in
a
couple
of
days
OK,
you
want
me
up
in
the
cage,
then
I'll
come
out
in
beast
mode
I
got
this
world
stuck
in
the
safe,
combination
is
the
G-code
It's
Weezy
motherfucker,
blood
gang
and
I'm
in
bleed
mode
All
about
my
dough
but
I
don't
even
check
the
peephole
So
you
can
keep
knocking
but
won't
knock
me
down
No
love
lost,
no
love
found
[Hook
-
Eminem
&
Lil
Wayne]
It's
a
little
too
late
to
say
that
you're
sorry
now
You
kicked
me
when
I
was
down
Fuck
what
you
say,
just
(don't
hurt
me,
don't
hurt
me
no
more)
That's
right
bitch:
and
I
don't
need
you,
don't
want
to
see
you
Bitch
you
get
(no
love)
You
show
me
nothing
but
hate
You
ran
me
into
the
ground
But
what
comes
around
goes
around
I
don't
need
you
(don't
hurt
me)
You
(don't
hurt
me
no
more)
That's
right,
and
I
don't
need
you,
don't
want
to
see
you
You
get
(no
love)
Bitch
you
get
(no
love)
And
I
don't
need
you
Get
em
[Verse

I'm
alive
again
More
alive
than
I
have
been
in
my
whole
entire
life
I
can
see
these
people's
ears
perk
up
as
I
begin
To
spaz
with
the
pen,
I'm
a
little
bit
sicker
than
most
Shit's
finna
get
thick
again
They
say
the
competition
is
stiff
But
I
get
a
hard
dick
from
this
shit,
now
stick
it
in
I
ain't
never
giving
in
again
Cuss
into
the
wind,
complete
freedom
Look
at
these
rappers,
how
I
treat
them
So
why
the
fuck
would
I
join
them
when
I
beat
them?
They
call
me
a
freak
because
I
like
to
spit
on
these
pussies
fore
I
eat
them
Man
get
these
whack
cocksuckers
off
stage
Where
the
fuck
is
Kanye
when
you
need
him?
Snatch
the
mic
from
him,
bitch
I'mma
let
you
finish
in
a
minute
Yeah
the
rap
is
tight
But
I'm
fucking
with
the
greatest
verse
of
all
time
So
you
might
want
to
go
back
to
the
lab
tonight
and
um
Scribble
out
them
rhymes
you
were
going
to
spit
And
start
over
from
scratch
and
write
new
ones
But
I'm
afraid
that
it
ain't
gonna
make
no
difference
When
I
rip
this
stage
and
tear
it
in
half
tonight
It's
an
adrenaline
rush
to
feel
the
bass
thump
In
the
place
all
the
way
to
the
parking
lot,
fellow
Set
fire
to
the
mic
and
ignite
the
crowd
You
can
see
the
sparks
from
hot
metal
Cold-hearted
from
the
day
I
Bogarted
the
game
I
so
started
to
rock
fellow
When
I'm
not
even
in
my
harshest
You
can
still
get
roasted
because
Marsh
is
not
mellow
Til
I'm
toppling
from
the
top
I'm
not
going
to
stop
I'm
standing
on
my
Monopoly
board
That
means
I'm
on
top
of
my
game
and
it
don't
stop
Til
my
hip
don't
hop
anymore
When
you
so
good
that
you
can't
say
it
Because
it
ain't
even
cool
for
you
to
sound
cocky
anymore
People
just
get
sick
cause
you
spit
These
fools
can't
drool
or
dribble
a
drop
anymore
And
you
can
never
break
my
stride
You
never
slow
the
momentum;
at
any
moment
I'm
about
to
blow
You'll
never
take
my
pride
Killing
the
flow,
slow
venom
and
the
opponent
Is
getting
no
mercy,
mark
my
words
Ain't
letting
up,
relentless
I
smell
blood,
I
don't
give
a
fuck:
keep
giving
them
hell
Where
was
you
when
I
fell
and
needed
help
up?
You
get
no
love.

We
touch
I
feel
a
rush
We
clutch
it
isnt
much
But
its
enough
to
make
me
wonder
what's
in
store
for
us
Its
lust
its
torcherous
You
must
be
a
socerous
cause
you
just
Did
the
impossible
Game
I
trust
dont
play
games
itll
be
dangerous
If
you
fuck
me
over
Cause
if
I
get
burnt
imma
show
you
what
its
like
to
hurt
Cause
I
been
treated
like
dirt
before
ya
And
love
is
evil
Spell
it
backwards
I'll
show
ya
Nobody
knows
me
I'm
cold
Walk
down
this
road
all
alone
Its
noones
fault
but
my
own
Its
the
path
ive
chosen
to
go
Frozen
as
snow
I
show
no
emotion
whatsoever
so
Dont
ask
me
why
I
have
no
love
for
these
mufuckin
hos
Bloodsuckin
suckubusses
what
the
fuck
is
up
with
this
Ive
tried
in
this
department
but
I
aint
had
no
luck
with
this
Its
sucks
but
its
exactly
what
I
thought
it
would
be
Like
tryin
to
start
over
I
gotta
hole
in
my
heart
I'm
some
kind
of
emotional
rollercoaster
Somethin
I
wont
go
on
til
you
toy
with
my
emotion
so
its
over
Its
like
an
explosion
everytime
I
hold
ya
wasnt
jokin
when
I
told
ya
Ya
take
my
breathe
away
Your
a
supernova..
and
I'm
a
I'm
a
space
bound
rocketship
and
your
heart's
the
moon
And
I
aim
it
right
at
you
Right
at
you
250
thousand
miles
and
a
clear
night
in
june
And
I
aim
it
right
at
you
Right
at
you
Right
at
you
I
do
whatever
it
takes
When
I'm
with
you
I
get
the
shakes
My
body
aikes
when
I
aint
With
you
I
have
zero
strength
Theres
no
limit
on
how
far
I
would
go
No
boundries
no
lengths
Why
do
we
say
that
until
we
get
that
person
that
we
thinks
Gonna
be
that
one
and
then
once
we
get
em
its
never
the
same
You
want
them
when
they
dont
want
you
Soon
as
they
do
feelings
change
Its
not
a
contest
and
I
aint
on
no
conquest
for
no
mate
I
wasnt
lookin
but
I
stumbled
onto
you
mustve
been
fate
But
so
much
is
at
stake
what
the
fuck
does
it
take
Lets
cut
to
the
chase
But
a
door
shuts
in
your
face
Promise
me
if
I
cave
in
and
break
and
leave
myself
open
That
I
wont
be
makin
a
mistake
I'm
a
space
bound
rocketship
and
your
heart's
the
moon
And
I
aim
it
right
at
you
Right
at
you
250
thousand
miles
and
a
clear
night
in
june
And
I
aim
it
right
at
you
Right
at
you
Right
at
you
So
after
a
year
and
6
months
its
no
longer
me
that
you
want
But
I
love
you
so
much
it
hurts
Never
mistreated
you
once
I
poured
my
heart
out
to
you
Let
down
my
guard
swear
to
god
Ill
blow
my
brains
in
your
lap
Lay
here
and
die
in
your
arms
Up
to
my
knees
and
I'm
bleedin
Im
tryin
to
stop
you
from
leavin
You
wont
even
listen
so
fuck
it
Im
tryin
to
stop
you
from
breathin
I
put
both
hands
on
your
throat
I
sit
on
top
of
you
squeezin
Til
I
snap
ya
neck
like
a
popsicle
stick
Aint
no
possible
reason
I
could
think
of
to
let
you
walk
up
out
this
house
And
let
you
live
Tears
streamed
down
both
of
my
cheeks
Then
I
let
you
just
go
and
just
give
And
before
I
put
that
gun
to
my
temple
I
told
you
this
And
I
would
do
anything
for
you
To
show
you
how
much
I
adored
you
But
its
over
now
Its
too
late
to
save
our
love
Just
promise
me
youll
think
of
me
everytime
you
look
up
in
the
sky
and
see
a
star
cause
imma
I'm
a
space
bound
rocketship
and
your
heart's
the
moon
And
I
aim
it
right
at
you
Right

250
thousand
miles
and

Caught

Too

Caught
in
a

25
to

I

I've
made
Maybe

But
I've

I
woulda

Down

I
no
longer
cry

Bitch,

Took

and
ran
it
straight
into
the

Into
the
dirt,
I
can
no
longer
stand
it
Now
my
respect,
I
demand
it
I'ma
take
control
of
this
relationship,
command
it
And
I'ma
be
the
boss
of
you
now,
goddamn
it
And
what
I
mean
is
that
I
will
no
longer
let
you
control
me
So
you
better
hear
me
out,
this
much
you
owe
me
I
gave
up
my
life
for
you,
totally
devoted
to
you
I
have
stayed
Faithful
all
the
way,
this
is
how
I
fuckin'
get
repaid?
Look
at
how
I
dress,
fuckin'
baggy
sweats,
go
to
work
a
mess
Always
in
a
rush
to
get
back
to
you,
I
ain't
heard
you
yet
Not
even
once
say
you
appreciate
me,
I
deserve
respect
I've
done
my
best
to
give
you
nothin'
less
than
perfectness
And
I
know
that
if
I
end
this
I'll
no
longer
have
nothin'
left
But
you
keep
treatin'
me
like
a
staircase:
it's
time
to
fuckin'
step
And
I
won't
be
comin'
back,
so
don't
hold
your
fuckin'
breath
You
know
what
you've
done,
no
need
to
go
in
depth
I
told
you
you'd
be
sorry
if
I
fuckin'
left
I
laughed
while
you
wept,
how's
it
feel
now?
Yeah,
funny,
ain't
it?
You
neglected
me
Did
me
a
favor,
though,
my
spirit
free
you've
set
But
a
special
place
for
you
in
my
heart
I
have
kept
It's
unfortunate,
but
it's…
Too
late
for
the
other
side
Caught
in
a
chase,
25
to
life
(Can't
take
no
more)
Too
late
for
the
other
side
Caught
in
a
chase,
25
to
life
I
feel
like
when
I
bend
over
backwards
for
you,
all
you
do
is
laugh
‘Cause
that
ain't
good
enough
You
expect
me
to
fold
myself
in
half
'til
I
snap
Don't
think
I'm
loyal,
all
I
do
is
rap
How
can
I
moonlight
on
the
side?
I
have
no
life
outside
of
that
Don't
I
give
you
enough
of
my
time?
You
don't
think
so,
do
you?
Jealous
when
I
spend
time
with
the
girls
Why
I'm
married
to
you
still?
Man,
I
don't
know
But
tonight
I'm
serving
you
with
papers
I'm
divorcing
you
–
go
marry
someone
else
and
make
'em
famous!
And
take
away
their
freedom
like
you
did
to
me
Treat
'em
like
you
don't
need
'em
and
they
ain't
worthy
of
you
Feed
'em
the
same
shit
that
you
made
me
eat
I'm
moving
on,
forget
you
Oh,
now
I'm
special?
I
ain't
feel
special
when
I
was
with
you
All
I
ever
felt
was
this
helplessness
Imprisoned
by
a
selfish
bitch
Chew
me
up
and
spit
me
out,
I
fell
for
this
So
many
times
it's
ridiculous
And
still
I
stick
with
this,
I'm
sick
of
this
But
in
my
sickness
and
addiction
you're
addictive
as
they
get
Evil
as
they
come,
vindictive
as
they
make
'em
My
friends
keep
askin'
me
why
I
can't
just
walk
away
from
I'm
addicted
to
the
pain,
the
stress,
the
drama
I'm
drawn
to
shit,
I
guess
I'm
a
Mess,
cursed
and
blessed,
but
this
time
I
Ain't
changin'
my
mind,
I'm
climbin'
out
this
abyss
You're
screamin'
as
I
walk
out
that
I'll
be
missed
But
when
you
spoke
of
people
Who
meant
the
most
to
you,
you
left
me
off
your
list
Fuck
you,
Hip-Hop!
I'm
leavin'
you
My
life
sentence
is
served,
bitch,
and
it's
just…
Too
late
for
the
other
side
Caught
in
a
chase
25
to
life
(I'm
gone,
man)
Too
late
for
the
other
side
Caught
in
a
chase
25
to
life
Too
late
Caught
in
a
chase
25
to
life
Yeah..
Haha..you
feel
that
baby?
Yeah,
I
feel
it
too.
Damn.
You
know..i'm
so
glad
we
could
spend
this
time
together
See,
not
as
crazy
as
you
thought
I
was
am
i?
Heh..
I'm
the
American
dream!
I'm
the
definition
of
white
trash
balling,
I'm
right
back
on
'em,
with
the
[scratches]
I
can't
call
it
Same
shit,
different
toilet,
oh
you
got
a
nice
ass
darlin'!
Can't
wait
to
get
you
into
my
Benz,
take
you
for
a
spin
What
you
mean
we
aint
fuckin',
you
take
me
for
a
friend?
Let
me
tell
you
the
whole
story
of
Shady's
origin
You'll
be
sorry
if
you
slam
my
Mercedes
door
again!
Now,
it
all
started
with
my
father
I
must
have
got
my
pimping
genes
from
him,
the
way
he
left
my
mama
I'm
a
rolling
stone
just
like
him,
word
to
Johnny
Trauma
(??)
Keep
my
entourage
with
me,
baby
I'll
make
a
promise
There
aint
nobody
as
bomb
as,
me
I'm
as
calm
as
The
breeze,
I'm
the
bees
knees,
his
legs
and
his
arms
I'm
a
S-superstar,
girl,
I'm
ready
for
you
mama!
Why
you
think
the
only
thing
I
got
on
is
my
pyjamas?
[Chorus
x2]
So
bad
So
good
that
I'm
so
bad
Guarantee
I'll
be
the
greatest
thing
you
ever
had
Cause
you
aint
never
met
nobody
like
me
And
you
aint
gonna
want
no-fucking-body
else
at
that..
I'm
equivalent
to
a
shot
of
Cuevo,
first
I
kiss
your
navel
Work
my
way
down,
baby
you
can
lay
down
on
the
table
But
you
may
wanna
find
something
more
stable
I
told
you
I
aint
fooling
from
the
gate,
this
aint
the
first
day
of
april!
But
thank
you
for
staying
April,
I'ma
make
you
learn
To
appreciate
me,
differentiate
me
From
these
phoney,
little
fishy
and
sissy
fake
G's
Skip
over
the
huggy-bear
and
all
the
kissyface,
please
Initiate
phase
three!
Missy
now
service
me
Take
another
shot
of
Jager,
shake
it
so
nervously
Take
your
time
baby,
ooh
you're
the
bomb
baby!
Ooh
you're
doing
that
even
better
than
your
mom
lady!
I
told
you
I'm
Shady,
you
didn't
listen
now,
did
you?
Relax
woman,
you
know
that
I'm
only
kidding
with
you
Got
a
twisted
sense
of
humour,
it's
warped,
but
I
didn't
hit
you
I
think
you're
finally
starting
to
get
the
picture,
I'm..
[Chorus
x2]
[Bridge]
Dynamite,
dynamite,
dynamite,
so!
Dynamite,
dynamite,
dynamite,
so!
I
can
hold
you
in
the
morning
But
in
the
evening
I
gotta
go..
'cause
I'm
on
to
the
next
girl,
And
the
next
girl
I
kinda
like,
oh,
oh,
oh..!
I
got
you
caught
up
in
the
rapture
Make
you
recapture
the
feelings
you
had
for
your
last
boyfriend
before
he
slapped
you
You
never
wanted
someone
so
bad
you're
sweating
But
if
I'm
what
you
wanted,
why'd
you
panic
when
I
grabbed
you?
Girl
don't
be
so
frantic
I'm
just
a
hopeless
romantic
Don't
try
to
fight
the
feeling
of
something
that's
organic
You
can't
ignore
it,
so
don't
just
stand
before
it
Just
drop
them
panties
to
the
floor,
let's
get
to
camcordin'
Damn
shorty,
I
told
you
this
was
bound
to
happen
Soon
as
you
wrote
your
number
on
a
napkin
I
was
bound
to
work
a
number
on
your
back
and
Throw
your
spine
out
of
alignment
My
love
has
got
you
so
blinded
you
couldn't
pick
Amy
Winehouse
out
of
a
lineup
So
stop
with
the
snoring,
pick
your
pint
up
Let's
get
the
pineapple
schnapps
going,
no
one'll
knock
cause
I'ma
hang
a
sign
up
Saying
"Don't
Disturb",
shorty
I'm
so
superb
I
say
the
right
things,
don't
I
spit
the
dopest
words?
[Chorus
x2]
[Bridge]
[Chorus
x2]
[Over
the
chorus]
Haha..
Dr.
Dre
2010!
Light
years
ahead
of
you..haha..
Whoo!
(Intro)
Yeah,
can't
stop
now...
This
maybe
the
last
chance
I
get,
to
be
famous
(Hook)
You
dream
of
trading
places,
I
have
been
changing
faces
You
cannot
fill
these
shoes,
there
is
too
much
to
lose
Wake
up
behind
these
trenches,
you
run
around
defenceless
There
is
too
much
to
lose,
You
cannot
fill
these
shoes
I
just
wanna
be
famous
But
be
careful
what
you
wish
for!
(Verse
1)
I
stuck
my
dick
in
this
game
like
a
rapist,
they
call
me
Slim
Rothelsberger
I
get
beserker
than
a
fed
up
post
office
worker
A
murker
with
a
mossberg,
I'm
pissed
off,
get
murdered
Like
someone
took
a
ketchup
squirter,
squirted
a
frankfurter
For
a
gangsta,
you
should
of
shit
your
pants
when
you
saw
The
chainsaw
get
to
waving
like
a
terrible
towel
I
faced
her
around
when
his
fangs
come
out,
get
your
brains
blown
out
That's
what
I
call
blowing
your
mind,
when
I
come
back
like
nut
on
your
spine
I'm
a
thumbtac
that
you
slept
on
son
Now
here
I
come
screaming
"attack"
like
I
stepped
on
one!
Lowering
the
totem
til'
he
showed
'em,
defiance,
giant
scrotum
He
don't
owe
them
bitches
shit,
his
bridges,
he
out
wrote
'em
He's
so
out
cold,
he's
knocked
out
at
the
south
pole
and
Nobody
fucks
with
him,
rigamortis
and
post-mortem
He's
dying
of
boredom,
take
your
best
rhymes,
record
'em
Then
try
to
thwart
him,
he'll
take
your
punchlines
and
snort
'em
Shit
stained
drawers,
you
gon'
fuck
with
the
guy
that
licks
the
blades
of
his
chainsaws
While
he
dips
'em
in
P.F.
chang's
sauce
Game's
off
homie,
hang
it
up
like
some
crank
calls
You
think
I'm
backing
down,
you
must
be
out
your
dang
skulls!
I'm
almost
famous
(Hook)
You
dream
of
trading
places,
I
have
been
changing
faces
You
cannot
fill
these
shoes,
there
is
too
much
to
lose
Wake
up
behind
these
trenches,
you
run
around
defenceless
There
is
too
much
to
lose,
You
cannot
fill
these
shoes
I
just
wanna
be
famous
But
be
careful
what
you
wish
for!
(Verse
2)
I'm
back
for
revenge,
I
lost
the
battle,
that
ain't
happening
again
I'm
at
your
throat
like
strep,
I
step
strapped
with
a
pen
Metaphors
wrote
on
my
hand,
some
are
distorting
my
mem-ory
Some
are
wrote
on
a
napkin,
do
what
I
have
to
to
win
Pulling
out
all
stops,
any
who
touch
a
mic
prior
Is
not
even
Austin
Powers,
how
the
fuck
are
they
Mike
Myers
And
tell
that
psycho
to
pass
the
torch
to
the
whacko
'for
I
take
a
shit
in
his
jackolantern
then
smash
it
on
his
porch
Now
get
off
my
dick,
dick's
too
short
of
a
word
for
my
dick
Get
off
my
antidisestablishmentarianism
you
prick!
Don't
call
me
the
champ,
call
me
the
space
shuttle
destroyer
I
just
blew
up
the
challenger,
matter
of
fact,
I
need
a
lawyer
I
just
laced
my
gloves
with
enough
plaster
to
make
a
cast
Beat
his
ass
naked
and
pee'd
in
his
corner
like
Verne
Troyer
Ya'll
are
Eminem
backwards,
you're
menime's
See
he's
in
a-whole-nother
weight
class,
his
slugs
your
BB's
Your
bean
bag
bullets,
you're
full
of
it,
you
were
dissing
his
CD's
Laughed
at
Infinite,
now
he's
back
like
someone
pissed
in
his
wheeties
No
peace
treaty's,
he's
turned
into
a
beast
His
new
Slim
Shady
EP's
got
the
attention
of
the
might
DRE
He's
almost
famous
(Hook)
You
dream
of
trading
places,
I
have
been
changing
faces
You
cannot
fill
these
shoes,
there
is
too
much
to
lose
Wake
up
behind
these
trenches,
you
run
around
defenceless
There
is
too
much
to
lose,
You
cannot
fill
these
shoes
I
just
wanna
be
famous
But
be
careful
what
you
wish
for!
(Verse
3)
Now
there
he
goes,
in
Dre's
studio,
cupping
his
balls
Screaming
the
wood
off
the
panelling,
cussing
the
paint
off
the
walls
Spewing
his
hate
to
these
haters,
showing
no
love
for
these
broads
He
ain't
giving
'em
shit,
he's
scissor
pinch
a
penny
so
hard
He'll
leave
a
bruise
on
the
brawn
so
dark
You
can
see
the
mark
when
it
scars,
til
Abraham
Lincoln
is
screaming
out
"AHHH!"
His
metaphors
and
similies
ain't
similar
to
them
not
at
all
If
they
don't
like
they
can
all
get
fucked,
instead
of
sucking
him
off
They
can
go
get
a
belt
or
a
neck
tie,
to
hang
themselves
by
Like
David
Carridy,
they
can
go
fuck
themselves
and
just
die
And
eat
shit
while
they
at
it,
he's
fucking
had
it
He's
mad
at
the
whole
world,
so
go
to
hell
and
build
a
snowman,
girl
The
bullies
become
bullied,
the
pussies
get
pushed
They
better
pull
me,
take
me
back
to
9th
grade
to
school
me
Cause
I
ain't
looking
back
only
forward,
this
whole
spot
blowing
Who
coulda
known
he'd
grow
to
be
a
poet
and
not
know
it
And
while
I'm
being
poetic,
let
me
get
a
stork
And
raise
the
bar
higher
than
my
opinion
of
these
women
?
So
bare
witness
to
some
biblical
shit
As
the
cold
wind
blowing,
this
world
ain't
gonna
know
what
hit
it,
he
did
it,
he
made
it,
he's
finally
famous!
(Grazie

Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
Well,
that's
all
right,
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
Well,
that's
all
right,
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
can't
tell
you
what
it
really
is
I
can
only
tell
you
what
it
feels
like
And
right
now
there's
a
steel
knife
in
my
windpipe
I
can't
breathe,
but
I
still
fight
while
I
can
fight
As
long
as
the
wrong
feels
right,
it's
like
I'm
in
flight
High
off
her
love,
drunk
from
her
hate
It's
like
I'm
huffing
paint
and
I
love
her
the
more
I
suffer
I
suffocate
and
right
before
I'm
about
to
drown
She
resuscitates
me,
she
fucking
hates
me,
and
I
love
it
Wait,
where
you
going?,
I'm
leaving
you
No,
you
ain't,
come
back!
We're
running
right
back,
here
we
go
again
It's
so
insane,
'cause
when
it's
going
good,
it's
going
great
I'm
Superman
with
the
wind
at
his
back,
she's
Lois
Lane
But
when
it's
bad
it's
awful,
I
feel
so
ashamed
I
snap,
Who's
that
dude?,
I
don't
even
know
his
name
I
laid
hands
on
her,
I'll
never
stoop
so
low
again
I
guess
I
don't
know
my
own
strength
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
Well,
that's
all
right,
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
Well,
that's
all
right,
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie,
I
love
the
way
you
lie
You
ever
love
somebody
so
much
You
can
barely
breathe
when
you're
with
them?
You
meet,
and
neither
one
of
you
even
know
what
hit
them
Got
that
warm
fuzzy
feeling
Yeah,
them
chills
used
to
get
them
Now
you're
getting
fucking
sick
of
looking
at
them?
You
swore
you'd
never
hit
them,
never
do
nothing
to
hurt
them
Now
you're
in
each
other's
face
Spewing
venom
in
your
words
when
you
spit
them
You
push,
pull
each
other's
hair,
scratch,
claw,
bit
them
Throw
them
down,
pin
them
So
lost
in
the
moments
when
you're
in
'em
It's
the
rage
that
took
over,
it
controls
you
both
So
they
say
it's
best
to
go
your
separate
ways
Guess
that
they
don't
know
you
'Cause
today,
that
was
yesterday
Yesterday
is
over,
it's
a
different
day
Sound
like
broken
records
playing
over
But
you
promised
her
next
time
you'd
show
restraint
You
don't
get
another
chance,
life
is
no
Nintendo
game
But
you
lied
again
Now
you
get
to
watch
her
leave
out
the
window
Guess
that's
why
they
call
it
window
pane
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
Well,
that's
all
right,
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
Well,
that's
all
right,
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie,
I
love
the
way
you
lie
Now,
I
know
we
said
things,
did
things,
that
we
didn't
mean
And
we
fall
back
into
the
same
patterns,
same
routines
But
your
temper's
just
as
bad
as
mine
is
You're
the
same
as
me
When
it
comes
to
love,
you're
just
as
blinded
Baby,
please
come
back,
it
wasn't
you,
baby
it
was
me
Maybe
our
relationship
isn't
as
crazy
as
it
seems
Maybe
that's
what
happens
when
a
tornado
meets
a
volcano
All
I
know
is
I
love
you
too
much
to
walk
away
though
Come
inside,
pick
up
your
bags
off
the
sidewalk
Don't
you
hear
sincerity
in
my
voice
when
I
talk?
Told
you
this
is
my
fault,
look
me
in
the
eyeball
Next
time
I'm
pissed
I'll
aim
my
fist
at
the
drywall
Next
time?
There
won't
be
no
next
time
I
apologize
even
though
I
know
it's
lies
I'm
tired
of
the
games,
I
just
want
her
back
I
know
I'm
a
liar,
if
she
ever
tries
to
fucking
leave
again
I'ma
tie
her
to
the
bed
and
set
this
house
on
fire
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
watch
me
burn
Well,
that's
all
right,
because
I
like
the
way
it
hurts
Just
gonna
stand
there
and
hear
me
cry
Well,
that's
all
right,
because
I
love
the
way
you
lie
I
love
the
way
you
lie,
I
love
the
way
you
lie
(Hook)
The
days
are
cold,
livin'
without
you
The
nights
are
long,
I'm
growing
older
I
miss
the
days
of
old,
thinkin'
about
you
You
may
be
gone,
but
you're
never
over
(Verse
1)
If
Proof
could
see
me
now,
I
know
he'd
be
proud
Somewhere
in
me
deep
down,
there's
something
in
me
he
found
That
made
him
believe
in
me,
now
no
one
can
beat
me
now
You
try,
it'll
be
them
doors,
Andre's
phatom,
believe
me
clowns
That
means
suicide
homie,
you'll
never
throw
me
Off
of
this
course,
blow
me
Bitch
I
do
this
all
for
the
sport
only
But
I
want
it
all,
I'm
not
just
talking
awards
homie
And
the
balls
in
my
court,
and
it's
lonely
On
top
of
the
world
when
you're
the
only
One
with
the
balls
in
your
shorts
To
leave
them
jaws
on
the
floor
with
no
re-
morse,
remember
that
when
they
get
to
doggin'
you
boy
homie
So
y'all
can
just
get
to
bloggin'
about
bologna
I'm
not
gonna
stop
the
saga
Continue,
no
stoppin'
the
force
Obi
I'm
moppin
the
floors
with
them,
I
keep
tryna
pass
it
But
they
keep
on
droppin'
the
torch
And
it
won't
be,
long
til
this
sport
is
O-V-
E-R,
Just
Blaz
and
we
knockin'
them
doors
and
no
we
ain't
pumpkins
on
Halloween
but
we'll
show
up
on
your
porch,
so
be
Careful
what
you
say,
there
ain't
no
punks
over
here
so
follow
me
Through
the
fog
like
I'm
S-N-double-O-P
Let
me
guide
you
through
the
smoke
G
If
only
I
wasn't
travellin'
down
this
road
by
my
lonely
No
one
who
knew
me
like
you
will
ever
know
me
I
don't
think
you
understand
how
much
you
meant
to
me
(Hook)
The
days
are
cold,
livin'
without
you
The
nights
are
long,
I'm
growing
older
I
miss
the
days
of
old,
thinkin'
about
you
You
may
be
gone,
but
you're
never
over
And
it
don't
stop
(oh)
And
it
don't
quit
(oh)
And
it
don't
stop
(oh)
And
it
don't
quit
(oh)
And
I
miss
you
(oh)
I
just
miss
you
(oh)
I
just
miss
you
(oh)
Homie,
I'll
never
forget
you
(no)
(Verse
2)
For
you,
I
wanna
write
the
sickest
rhyme
of
my
life
So
sick
it'll
blow
up
the
mic,
It'll
put
the
dyna
in
mite
Yeah,
it'll
make
the
dopest
MC
wanna
jump
off
a
bridge
and
shit
hisself
Tap
dancin'
all
over
the
beat,
it'll
jump
off
the
page
and
spit
itself
Yeah
it's
the
best
thing
I
could
do,
right
now
for
you
Doodi
is
to
rap
Sp
I'mma
fuck
til'
I
die,
yeah
I'mma
do
it
to
death
And
instead
of
mourning
your
death,
I'd
rather
celebrate
your
life
Elevate
to
new
height,
step
on
the
gas
and
accelerate,
I'mma
need
two
mics
Cuz
the
way
that
I'm
feelin'
tonight,
everything
I
can
just
do
right
There's
nothing
that
I
can
do
wrong,
I'm
too
strong
and
I'm
just
too
hyped
Just
finished
the
rhyme
and
bust
it
and
excuse
the
corny
metaphor
They'll
never
catch
up
to
all
this
energy
that
I've
mustered
So
God
just
help
me
out
while
I
fight
through
this
greivin'
process
Tryna
process
this
loss
is
makin'
me
nauseous
But
this
depression
ain't
takin
me
hostage
I've
been
patiently
watchin'
this
game,
pacin'
these
hallways
You
had
faith
in
me
always
Proof
you
knew
I'd
come
out
of
this
slump,
rise
from
these
ashes
Come
right
back
on
they
asses,
and
go
Mike
Tyson
on
these
bastards
And
Imma
show
'em,
blow
'em
out
the
water,
slaughter
'em
homes
I'll
own
so
many
belts
the
only
place
they
can
hit
me
is
below
'em
Homie
I
know
I'm,
never
gonna
be
the
same
with
you
I
woulda
never
came
in
this
game,
I'm
going
insane
without
you
Matter
of
fact
it
was
just
the
other
night,
had
another
dream
about
you
You
told
me
to
get
up,
I
got
up
and
spread
my
wings
and
I
flew
You
gave
me
a
reason
to
fight,
I
was
on
my
way
to
see
you
You
told
me
nah
Dudey,
you're
not
layin'
on
that
table
I
knew
I
was
gonna
make
it,
soon
as
you
said
think
of
Hailie,
I
knew
There
wasn't
no
way
that
I
was
gonna
ever
leave
them
babies,
and
Proof
Not
many
are
lucky
enough
to
have
a
guardian
angel
like
you
Lord
I'm
so
thankful,
please
don't
think
I
don't
feel
grateful,
I
do
Just
grant
me
the
strength
that
I
need,
for
one
more
day
to
get
through
So
homie
this
is
your
song,
I
dedicate
this
to
you
I
love
you
Dudey
(Hook)
The
days
are
cold,
livin'
without
you
The
nights
are
long,
I'm
growing
older
I
miss
the
days
of
old,
thinkin'
about
you
You
may
be
gone,
but
you're
never
over
And
it
don't
stop
(oh)
And
it
don't
quit
(oh)
And
it
don't
stop
(oh)
And
it
don't
quit
(oh)
And
I
miss
you
(oh)
I
just
miss
you
(oh)
I
just
miss
you
(oh)
Homie,
I'll
never
forget
you
(no)

[Intro:]
Aw
man,
yea
You
ever
be
in
the
club
man,
you
get
in
a
fight
And
people
that
you
don't
even
know
jump
in?
[Verse
1:]
You
feel
like
you
wanna
hit
something,
your
fist
clenches,
your
pissed
You
just
wanna
get
someone
with
shit,
jump
em
[?
]
You're
bout
to
get
your
shit
pushed
in,
I'm
just
inches
away
I'm
splitting
your
shit
wide
open,
no
stitches
could
save
So
die
with
your
eyes
open,
you
hope
this
isn't
the
way
You
end
up
going
out,
but
I
guess
it
just
is
I'm
afraid
Razors,
scissors
and
blades
make
Jason
say
isn't
this
great
On-lookers
participate
in
this
ass-kicking
debate
They're
starting
to
take
place
in
the
middle
of
the
street
Little
did
you
know
there'd
be
an
all-out
brawl
soon
as
you
heard
this
beat
Emergency
personnel
rush
to
the
murder
scene,
but
it's
too
late
It's
absolute
pandemonium,
whisked
away
In
a
ambulance
is
your
fate,
nothing
nobody
told
you
when
you-
Left
your
house
today
coulda
made
you
anticipate
Such
an
ass
whooping,
okay,
til
the
anger
dissipates
You
get
punched
in
the
face,
reciprocate
[Chorus:
x2]
So
what
the
deal,
ridaz?
Would
you
excuse
me
while
I
feel
my
nuts?
My
balls
are
feeling
a-mighty
big
now
I
might
just
have
to
dig
down
and
pull
em
through
my
britches
I
said...
[Verse
2:]
You
step
in
the
place
with
enough
misplaced
anger
to
catch
a
case
Anxious
to
get
in
some
shit,
got
your
gangstas
all
with
your
ladies
You
better
go
get
your
mase
cause
shady
said
so
You
may
wanna
pick
up
the
radio
and
bang
it
against
your
face
That's
how
f-king
rowdy
you
feel,
now
do
you
still
wanna
grill?
If
you
don't
wanna
get
the
shit
beat
outta
you,
chill
Cause
if
you
doubt
me
you
will,
yea
got
me
a
pill,
found
me
a
thrill
I
got
a
couple
of
drinks
here
and
I'm
bound
to
refill
Girl
howdy,
how
do
you
feel
ma?
This
c-ksucker
did
not
spill
my
drink,
Oh
HELL
no
He
must
be
tryna
kill
my
buzz,
I
will
not
budge
And
what
the
deal
ridaz?
Now
here
they
all
come
and
they
got
your
back
in
like
2
seconds
flat
That's
probably
a
record
yea,
you
wasn't
expecting
that
Cause
they
want
in
on
the
act,
there's
a
cognac-
Bottle,
we
snuck
it
in
cause
the
beer
that
they
were
serving
here
was
only
tap
I'm
biting,
I
fight
dirty,
you
might
get
kicked
in
the
nuts
You're
frightened
like
this
guy
might
hurt
me
You're
quite
certain
he's
nuts,
I've
hit
myself
in
the
face
harder
Play
smarter,
you
may
start
a
[?
]
you
need
a
chainsaw
to
Dig
your
way
out
of,
go
powder
your
nose-
P-sy
the
harder
you
yell,
the
harder
I
slap
the
shit
out
of
you
hoes
You
set
it
off
fa-ot,
so
now
how
do
you
spose-
We
settle
it,
hit
me
in
the
nose,
we'll
see
how
it
goes
[Chorus
x2]
It's
shear
hustle,
I
bob,
weave,
deflate
your
beer
muscles
We're
tussling,
the
crowd's
starting
to
cheer
us
And
adrenaline's
rushing
through
us
just
like
a
geyser
gushing
Too
much
Budweiser
in
my
blood,
I'm
strangling
your
windpipe
And
[?
]
my
signatures,
ligature
marks
Look
at
you
all
big
with
your
remarks,
and
I
swing
an
icepick
at
your
heart
At
least
that's
what
it
feels
like
when
I
pick
you
apart
And
dig
at
you
and
break
you
down
like
the
bitch
that
you
are
The
predicament
starts
when
I
throw
a
brick
at
your
car
The
pain
inflicted
upon
you,
it's
so
sick,
it's
bizarre
Shit,
this
is
almost
ridiculous,
addictive
as
far
As
having
me
wanna
rip
out
your
frickin
ligaments
ARGH!
You
hit
like
a
bitch,
you
scratch
me
with
your
nails,
for
that-
You
catch
an
open-hand
slap,
break
off
your
nail
like
BAP!
In
fact,
I'll
have
the
crowd
smacking
you
themselves
Where's
D12,
I
don't
feel
like
doing
this
by
myself
[Chorus
x2]
[Eminem:]
Ladies
and
gentlemen
make
some
noise
Aww
shit
Yeah
Y'all
ready
to
get
this
shit
started
or
what
Well
I
brought
some
friends
with
me
too
Now
I
ain't
back
just
for
the
sake
of
just
saying
I'm
back
I
could
relax
but
I'd
rather
stack
ammo
on
tracks
Couple
Xanax
light
a
couple
wax
candles
then
black
out
And
relapse
til
I
yack
Jack
Daniels
and
yap,
burp
bubbles
Attitudes
immaturing,
double
shot
of
bacardi
party
Vision
is
blurring,
waa
hooo
I
can't
see
shit
My
words
get
to
slurring
Uh
oh,
you
can
call
me
R
Kelly
now
or

What's
incurring
before
after
enduring
the
show
Has

on
the
bad
news
I'm
baring
Whoa
what
is
it
word
play
No
I'm
pushing
you
out
the
dumps
So
suck
my
dick
on
the
couch
if
you
wanna
cushion
the
blow
Then
stomp
your
fucking
feet
till
you
get
to
squishing
a
hoe
It's
panda-monium
[?
]
when
you
see
him,
damn
Baby
you
look
good
you're
giving
me
wood
You
should
pull
over
like
a
sweat
shirt
with
a
hood
[?
]
you
and
me
both
Break
bread
while
I'm
copping
over
this
game
Now
pinch
a
loaf
now
homie
who's
your
favourite
pain
in
the
ass
Who
claims
to
be
spitting
the
same
flames
as
me
I'm
Kanye
when
he
crashed
In
otherwords
I
got
the
hood
on
smash
Like
I
stepped
on
the
gas
destroyed
the
front
end
Deployed
the
damn
airbags
from
the
dash
Went
through
'em
and
laughed
Came
back
an
hour
after
the
accident
and
bit
A
god-damn
jaw-breaker
in
half
So
stop
[?
]
the
funk
and
start
shaking
ya
ass
Slaughterhouse
in
the
house
with
the
caucasion
rapping
Just
Blaze
on
the
track
What
the
fuck
is
more
amazing
than
that
slut
Answer

[Royce

I'm

Fire

Are
prying

lump

Designed

Jimmy
'Io

Marshall
The

tucked
against
the
lining
I
pull
it
out
and
flip
your

69ing
It's
like
Rick
James
is
shooting
up
your

fuck
your

You
screaming
'fuck
the
world'
with
your
middle
finger
up
While
I'm
over
here
shoving
my
dick
in
a
hole
in
the
mud
My

know
I'm
perfectly
fit
for
murder
Because
I
murdered
her,
so
you
can
call
me
Nickel

I

a
Posse

Bad,

Quite
scary

a

fear-
In

tight

this

When
I
rip

This

this

Millions
of
questions
arose
after
they
did
an

What
I
exhibit,
seems
to
be
non-contagious
yet
anybody
can
get
it
Aww
shit
I
did
it
again,
when
I
lit
with

Get

[Verse

Obie

Obie
the
person
that
came
up
and
deverted
Cause
of
nervousness
That
was
solely
the
homie's
verdict
It
was
worth
it
Cause
he
changed,
became
so
I
observed
it
Certain
such
of
a
purpose
Its
like
a
different
version
So
much
hurtin'
and
pain
Gave
him
game
for
certain
Thats
why
its
curtains
at
his
murder
if
you
get
him
worked
up
I'm
so
assertive
on
these
motherfuckers
actin'
tougher
Had
enough
of
Isolating
myself
in
a
room
Writing
poems
for
songs
doin'
the
same
in
school
Now
look
what
he
became
a
fool
Cause
he
learned
how
to
sustain
his
two
And
obtain
fame
from
you
Living
hard
but
still
Julliard
A
god
walks
and
ain't
spent
a

Regardless
of
this

Suck

Label
me
a
genius
if
you
ever
seen
as
you
would
say
He
may
seem
as
though
hes
plain
normal
If
you
ever
meet
him
greet
him
with
a
shake
see
he
ain't
as
mean
as
what
they
say
See
the
thing
is
maybe
he
can't
always
think
of
things
to
say
so
hes
vague
So
they
mistake
him
for
just
bein'
crazed
You
don't
think
hes
strange
You
turn
around
and
tell
him
please
and
thanks
And
catch
him
flippin'
you
off
with
his
pants
down
Hands
around
His
Scrotum
tuckin'
his
fuckin'
Penis
between
his
legs

You

And

Couple

Just
incase
I

with

Smoke

This

Shady
let

Let

Not

I
used

now
Carmen

Strap
an

cord
to
her

and
electrocute
her
I'm
off

I'm
on

I
might
just
scoot
by

shoot
my

in

with

Spit
in

while
I
vomit

I'm

With
the
soul
of

I
leave
the

than
vomit
Like
a
bullemic
woman
with
an
uneasy
stomach
I
pass
by
people
on
the
street
they
seem
like

Stiffer
than

of

you

So
can
you
hear
me
coming
Eminem
this
beat
is
absolutely
disgusting
It's
probably
go
diseases
on

I'm
just
being
honest,
I
can
see
the
comments
I
can
see
the
evolution
as
we
creep
up
on
it
I
put
that
music
in
your
veins
like
a
needle
junkie
Shit
I
just
do
this
for
the
haters,
I
don't
need
the
money
I
diarrhea
on
track
so
it
needs
plunging
Somebody
tell
these
girls
please
release
my
undies
Nobody
really
understands
my
language
I
find
it
complicated
just
to
hold
a
conversation
But
still
I
got
a
whole
lot
of
patience
Sittin'
back
watching
Earth
from
my
Space

Our

We

glue
But

when
we
were
fallin'
apart
You
were
sittin
on

But
no

but
us

we
were
beefin'
Cause
that's
what
happens
when
you
beef
with
crew
It
stays
in
the
crew,
cause
it's
just
crew
But
we're
back
now,

we
took
our
time
while
our

grew
Only

a
hurry
for
now
is
to
rush

And

you
Have
some
bullshit
to
readjust
Still
got
(??)
a
just
a
few
of
us
left,
but
it'd
be
unjust
to
rob
us
our
(??)
due
So
rest
in
peace
to
buz(?)
and
proof
This
one's
for
you
homies,
we

But

[Verse
1:]
Got
a
dick,
it's
as
big
as
a
banana
I
try
to
control
it,
but
I
can't.
It's
too
tough,
it's
like
an
AK
flip
banana.
You
better
watch
out,
Hannah
Montana!
Man,
what's
the
matter?
Have
you
no
manners?
(no!)
You
know
the
girl
from
Juno's
address?
Yeah,
I'm
a
prob'ly
go
to
jail
for
that.
Now
I
got
the
cops
on
my
tail
for
that!
Run
up
on
your
car
with
a
stale
banana
In
your
tail
pipe,
can't
believe
you
fell
for
that.
It
coulda
been
a
Molotov
Cocktail
for
that.
Wait
a
minute,
man!
What
the
hell
was
that?
I
heard
a
noise,
where
you
goin'?
What
are
you,
bananas?!
You
can't
go
back
there,
stupid
ass!
I
just
seen
a
woman
in
a
Freddy
Krueger
mask.
Who
the
fuck
are
you,
Superman?
All
you
have
is
a
little
stupid
can
Of
whipped
cream
what
the
hell
you
gonna
do
with
that?
I'm
a
put
it
on
my
wee
wee.
Ooh,
good
answer!
A
super
bonanza
extravaganza.
Man,
go
ahead,
what
you
waitin'
for?
You
better
get
them
clothes
off,
baby
boy.
Come
on!
Let's
go!
We're
gonna
make
a
porn!
Ready,
set,
go!
Hit
play,
record!
[Chorus]
[Verse
2:]
Are
you
ready?
-
You
better
hold
the
camera
steady.
She's
pro'ly
back
there
with
a
damn
machete!
She's
pro'ly
gonna
eat
you
like
canned
spaghetti
She's
pro'ly
gonna
kill
ya;
still
wanna
check,
see?
Have
a
little
quick
look?
-
Go
on?
She's
pro'ly
six
foot
tall
like
bigfoot,
the
hell
with
that?
We
probably
should
run,
don't
dare
look
back!
We
probably,
probably,
probably
There
probably
was
a
problem
at
the
post
office
or
something
But
you
probably
didn't
know
that,
did
ya?
Now
what
ya
gonna
do
when
she
gets
ya?
I
ain't
goin'
with
ya,
forget
ya!
Quit
tryna
hold
my
hand,
mista'!
Pretend
she's
your
little
sista'!
-
Little
sista'!
[?]
Might
as
well
take
the
whipped
cream
with
ya
And
when
you
see
her,
make
sure
you
get
a
picture!
We
could
try
to
make
another
"Blair
Witch-a
-
movie"
A
beastiality
porno
with
smoothies.
[Chorus]
[Verse
3:]
It's
Eerie,
but
here
comes
Zack
and
Miri
The
"Beauty
And
The
Beast",
his
back
is
hairy.
But
she
don't
care,
they're
attractive,
very
Very
sexually
active,
very.
No,
Zack!
Don't
go
back
in
there!
It's
too
late
now,
she's
grabbin'
hair!
He
screams:
"Bloody
Mary!"
-
Grabs
a
mirror
But
stop
just
ain't
in
her
vocabular.
"Get
off
me,
please!
Get
off
me,
stop!"
Ballin'
back
at
a
coffee
shop.
They
go
non-stop.
-
She
says:
"Go!"
He
says:
"No!
"
-
She
says:
"Oh!"
Back
and
forth,
they
scream
and
shout.
Yeah,
boy;
let
them
demons
out!
It's
the
kinda
nightmare
you
dream
about
Uh-oh!
Now
the
whipped
cream
is
out.
I
get
sick
thoughts.
-
Sick,
sick,
thoughts.
The
things
you
could
do
with
your
lipstick
gloss.
Put
it
on
my
dick
'til
the
tip
looks
orange.
Bitch,
keep
going!
-
Bitch,
keep
going!
[Chorus]
[Outro:]
Banana...
Banana...
Banana...

Banana...
Banana...
[INTRO]
I'm
a
little
nutty
and
I
know
it
but
if
you
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
my
history
you
will
see
that
I'm
not
the
only
one
who's
off
his
rocker
there
were
many
before
me
I
was
always
labelled
the
black
sheep
of
the
family
what
a
bad
seed
I
grow
to
be
but
if
you
take
a
look
at
us
now
you'll
see
the
apple
didn't
fall
too
far
from
the
tree
[VERSE
1]
(haha)
alright,
look
I'ma
tell
you
the
story
from
my
side
maybe
you'll
understand
check
it
out
you
done
witnessed
unexplainable
shit
too
insane
to
explain
people
run
from
what
the
just
don't
get
maybe
Shady
shoulda
just
hit
'em
with
a
little
bit
did
I
spit
too
soon?
Should
I
of
spoon
fed
'em
it?
but
I
was
just
so
eager
to
prove
I
was
even
worth
being
in
the
same
league
or
the
room
with
of
the
people
of
whom
I
was
in
every
now
and
then
I
look
up
like
I
was
seeking
approval
was
it
because
of
the
pigment
of
my
skin
or
was
it
a
figment
of
my
imagination
maybe
it
bothered
me
more
than
it
did
them
maybe
it
wasn't
a
big
deal
back
then
but
to
me
it
was,
see
what
it
was
was
I
had
developed
the
complex
from
being
judged
Proof
spit
his
verse,
now
I'm
next,
let's
see
who
I'm
in
the
booth
staring
back
to
see
who's
mugs
I
get
a
reaction
from,
usually
the
first
thumb
was
from
Proof
and
the
rest
of
the
group
backed
him
up
and
no
one
lied
to
each
other
cause
none
of
us
had
deals
it
was
real,
we
just
wanted
tickets
for
that
meal
[CHORUS]
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me
sometimes
I
feel
like
I'm
going
crazy
but
take
a
look
at
my
family
cause
the
apple
don't
fall
too
far
from
the

said

[VERSE
2]
Ever
since
my
mother
was
pregnant
with
her
second
egg
cause
she
said
that
I
had
a
baby
sister
who
fell
out
of
the
window
I
was
too
young
to
remember
Kansas
City
projects
I
was
like
5,
6,
and
how
come
I
remember
Malcolm,
Isaac,
and
Boogie
if
it
was
the
projects
in
Missouri?
cause
those're
my
best
friends
until
Isaac
took
my
tricycle
and
my
uncle
Todd
went
to
try
to
go
get
it
back
and
ended
up
getting
jumped
and
cut
in
the
gut
with
a
switch
and
70-some
stitches
which
is
still,
to
this
day
why
my
mother
still
tries
to
show
me
some
old
fake
picture
of
a
fictitious
little
sister
who
never
existed
and
this
is
why
part
of
my
life's
so
twisted
but
I
can
never
be
as
sick
as
that
bitch
is
and,
by
the
way,
that
picture's
one
of
my
relatives
[CHORUS]
Sometimes
I
feel
like
it's
just
me

I
feel

I'm
going

[VERSE

You
probably
have
to
peel
back
layers
upon
layers
of
pain
to
see
why
everything
I
say
is
so
insane
what's
different
about
my
brain
that
separates
me
from
other
players
in
this
game?
on
the
surface,
it
may
seem
like
a
scheme
or
some
sort
of
scam
for
me
to
get
some
damn
sympathy
but
that's
the
last
thing
I
need
is
for
people
to
walk
around
feeling
sorry
for
me
(me)
and
I'm
not
a
G,
never
claimed
to
be
I
gave
my
vest
to
Cashis,
he'll
need
it
more
than
me
but
we'll
see,
cause
we
ain't
lookin'
for
beef
but
if
it
comes
our
way,
what
do
we,
turn
the
other
cheek?
come
on
[CHORUS]
Sometimes
I

Thanks

I
love
you
but
I
just
can't
deal
With
the
stress
this
game
is
giving
me...
But
before
I
go
You
know
I
can't
close
the
show
Without
no
closure
So
before
I
leave...
Yeah
I
just
want
to
take
the
time
out
to
basically
say
Rest
In
Peace
to
Deshaun
Holton
That's
my
heart
man
Dr
Dre
For
giving
me
the
oppurtunity
just
to
even
listen
to
me
to
get
me
to
this
point
I'd
like
to
thank
Jimmy
Iovine,
Interscope,
Aftermath,
everybody
in
the
whole
Shady
staff
everybody
whose
basically
supported
me
from
day
one
Paul

Tracy

You

I
love
you

I
couldn't
do
it
all
without
you

when

whole
city
of
Detroit

Which

I

Oh,

And

And

I'm

so
i
may

you
aint
even
luke
warm
My
pubes
hotter
than
you
Your
soft
I
use
fire
to
cool
me
off
I
told
em
I'll
grow
up
one
day
and
show
'em
I'd
be
able
to
choke
clouds
Pick
up
lightenin'
bolts
and
throw
'em
Take
the
world
by
storm
with
these
words
I
form
Georgie
porgie
kissed
the
girls,
make
the
girls
cry
for
em
Make
'em
swarm,
make
'em
fight
over
the
shirts
I've
worn
Sworn
over
my
sweat
towels,
its
mind
blowin
Yes
Im
livin'
the
dream
homie,
cant
nothin'
compare
I'm
so
up,
I'm
stuck
in
mid
air
I'm
lovin'
it
yeah
Its
like
these
people
are
steps
now,
all
they
do
is
stare
These
haters
is
so
pussy
they're
afraid
to
be
scared
This
is
pay
back,
like
I
owe
'em
back
pay
They
spat
in
my
face,
now
I'm
back
to
do
them
the
same
exact
way
And
leave
this
rap
game
with
a
bad
taste,
And
slap
it
back
out,
before
I
step
back
out
of
this
crap
thanks
Slap
me
now
I'm
slapping
'em
back
hey!
fuck
it
we'll
slap
back
But
yeh
okay
now
we'll
talk
cause
I'm
smack
ay
And
I
aint
looking
back
infact
they
can
stare
at
my
ass
crack
How's
that
for
hindsight,
what
the
track
say?
[Just
Blaze
-
Chorus]
[Verse
1]
It's
like
I'm
in
this
dirt,
digging
up
old
hurt
Tried
everything
to
get
my
mind
off
you,
it
won't
work
All
it
takes
is
one
song
on
the
radio
you're
right
back
on
it
Reminding
me
all
over
again
how
you
fucking
just
brushed
me
off
And
left
me
so
burnt,
spent
a
lot
of
time
trying
to
soul
search
Maybe
I
needed
to
grow
up
a
little
first
Well,
looks
like
I
hit
a
growth
spurt
But
I
am
coming
for
closure
Don't
suppose
an
explanation
I'm
owed
for
The
way
that
you
turned
your
back
on
me
Just
when
I
may
have
needed
you
most
Oh,
you
thought
it
was
over
You
can
just
close
the
chapter
And
go
about
your
life,
like
it
was
nothing
You
ruined
mine,
but
you
seem
to
be
doing
fine
I'd
never
recovered
but
tonight
I
betcha
that
whatcha
'bout
to
go
through's
tougher
than
anything
I
ever
have
suffered
Can't
think
of
a
better
way
to
define
poetic
justice
Can
I
hold
grudges,
mind
is
saying:
"let
it
go,
fuck
this"
Heart
is
saying:
"I
will
once
I
bury
this
bitch
alive
Hide
the
shovel
and
then
drive
off
in
the
sunset"
[Hook:
Sarah
Jaffe]
I
flee
the
scene
like
it
was
my
last
ride
You
see
right
through,
oh,
you
had
me
pegged
the
first
time
You
can't
see
the
truth
but
it's
easier
to
justify
what's
bad
is
good
And
I
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy,
I
just
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
[Verse
2]
And
to
think
I
used
to
think
you
was
the
shit,
bitch
To
think
it
was
you
at
one
time
I
worshipped,
shit
Think
you
can
hurt
people
and
just
keep
getting
away
with
it?
Not
this
time,
you
better
go
and
get
sewing
kit,
bitch
Finish
this
stitch
so
you
can
reap
what
you
sow,
nitwit
Thought
some
time
had
past
and
I
forget
it,
forget
it!
You
left
our
family
in
shambles
You
expect
me
to
just
get
over
him?
Pretend
he
never
existed
Maybe
gone,
but
he's
not
forgotten
And
don't
think
cause
he's
been
out
the
pictures
so
long
That
I've
stopped
the
plottin'
and
still
ain't
coming
to
get
ya
You're
wrong
and
that
shit
was
rotten
And
the
way
you
played
him,
same
shit
you
did
to
me,
go!
Have
you
any
idea
that
shit
I've
gone
through?
Feelings
I
harbor,
all
this
pent
up
resentment
I
hold
on
to
Not
once
you
called
to
ask
me
how
I'm
doing
Letters,
you
don't
respond
to
'em
Fuck
it,
I'm
coming
to
see
you
And
gee
who
better
to
talk
to
than
you?
The
cause
of
my
problems
My
life
is
garbage
and
I'm
'bout
to
take
it
out
on
you
Poof,
then
I'm
gone
[Hook]
I
flee
the
scene
like
it
was
my
last
ride
You
see
right
through,
oh,
you
had
me
pegged
the
first
time
You
can't
see
the
truth
but
it's
easier
to
justify
what's
bad
is
good
And
I
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy,
I
just
hate
to
be
the
bad
guy
[Verse
3]
I've
been
driving
around
your
side
of
this
town
Like
9
frickin'
hours
and
45
minutes
now
Finally
I
found
your
new
address,
park
in
your
drive
Feel
like
I
been
waiting
on
this
moment
all
of
my
life
And
it's
now
arrived,
and
my
mouth
is
full
of
saliva
My
knife
is
out
and
I'm
ducking
on
the
side
of
your
house
See,
it's
sad
it
came
to
this
point
Such
a
disappointment
I
had
to
make
this
appointment
to
come
and
see
ya
But
ain't
here
for
ya
empathy,
I
don't
need
your
apology
Or
your
friendship
of
sympathy,
it's
revenge
that
I
seek
So
I
sneak
vengefully
and
treat
your
bedroom
window
Like
I
reach
my
full
potential,
I
peaked
Continue
to
peep,
still
bent
low
Keep
tapping
the
glass
lightly
then
start
to
crescendo
Sneak
all
the
way
'round
to
the
back
porch
Man,
door
handles
unlocked,
shouldn't
be
that
easy
to
do
this
You
don't
plan
for
intruders
before
hand?
Surprised
to
see
me?
Cat
got
your
tongue?
Gag,
chloroform
rag,
gag
almost
hack
up
a
lung
Like
you
picked
up
an
axe
up
and
then
swung
Stick
to
the
core
plan,
drag
to
the
back
of
a
trunk
By
one
of
your
fans,
irony
spectacular,
huh?
Now
who's
a
faggot,
you
punk?
And
here's
your
Bronco
hat,
you
can
have
that
shit
back
cause
they
suck
It's
just
me,
you
and
the
music
now,
Slim
I
hope
you
hear
it
we
are
in
a
car
right
now
Wait,
here
comes
my
favorite
lyric
I'm
the
bad
guy
who
makes
fun
of
people
that
die
And
hey,
here's
a
sequel
to
my
Mathers
LP
Just
to
try
to
get
people
to
buy
How's
this
for
publicity
stunt?
This
should
be
fun
Last
album
now
cause
after
this
you'll
be
officially
done
Eminem
killed
by
M&M
Matthew
Mitchell,
bitch,
I
even
have
your
initials
I
initially
was
gonna
bury
you
next
to
my
brother,
but
fuck
it
Since
you
love
you're
city
so
much
I
figured,
what
the
fuck
the
best
place
you
could
be
buried
alive
is
right
here
Two
more
exits,
town
is
quite
near
I
hope
we
don't
get
stopped,
no
license
I
fear
That
sirens
I
hear?
Guess
90
on
the
freeway
wasn't
the
brightest
idea
As
cops
appear
in
my
driver
side
mirror
(Oh,
God,
Police!!
Ah!)
Hope
foxtrot
gets
an
aerial
shot
of
your
burial
plot,
at
least
New
plan
Stan
Slim,
chauvinist
pig
drove
in
this
big,
lincoln
town
car
Well
gotta
go,
almost
at
the
bridge,
haha
big
bro
it's
for
you
Slim,
this
is
for
him
and
Frank
Ocean,
oh
hope
you
can
swim
good!
Now
say
you
hate
homos
again!
[Verse
4]
I
also
represent
anyone
on
the
receiving
end
of
those
jokes
you
offend
I'm
the
nightmare
you
fell
asleep
in
and
woke
up
still
in
I'm
your
karma
closing
in
with
each
stroke
of
a
pen
Perfect
time
to
have
some
remorse
to
show
for
your
sin
No,
it's
hopeless,
I'm
the
denial
that
you're
hopelessly
in
When
they
say
all
of
this
is
approaching
its
end
But
you
refuse
to
believe
that
it's
over,
here
we
go
all
over
again
Backs
to
the
wall,
I'm
stacking
up
all
them
odds
Toilets
clogged,
Yeah
cause
I'm
talking
a
lot
of
shit
but
I'm
backing
it
all
up
But
in
my
head
there's
a
voice
in
the
back
and
it
hollas
After
the
track
is
demolished
I
am
your
lack
of
a
conscience
I'm
the
ringing
in
your
ears
I'm
the
polyps
on
the
back
of
your
tonsils
Eating
your
vocal
chords
after
your
concerts
I'm
your
time
that's
almost
up
that
you
haven't
acknowledged
Grab
for
some
water
but
I'm
that
pill
that's
too
jagged
to
swallow
I'm
the
bullies
you
hate,
that
you
became
With
every
faggot
you
slaughtered
Coming
back
on
you
every
woman
you
insult
That,
with
the
double-standards
you
have
when
it
comes
to
your
daughters
I
represent
everything,
you
take
for
granted
Cause
Marshall
Mathers
the
rapper's
persona's
half
a
facade
And
Matthew
and
Stan's
just
symbolic,
of
you
not
knowing
what
you
had
until
it's
gone
Cause
after
all
the
glitz
and
the
glam,
no
more
fans
that
are
calling
your
name
Cameras
are
off
Sad,
but
it
happens
to
all
of
them
I'm
the
hindsight
to
say,
I
told
you
so!
Foreshadows
of
all
the
things
that
are
to
follow
I'm
the
future
that's
here
to
show
you
what
happens
tomorrow
If
you
don't
stop
after
they
call
you
the
Biggest
laughing
stock
of
rap
who
can't
call
it
quits
When
it's
time
to
walk
away
I'm
every
guilt
trip
The
baggage
you
had
But
as
you
gather
up
all
your
possessions
If
there's
anything
you
have
left
to
say
Unless
it
makes
an
impact
don't
bother
So
before
you
rest
your
case
Better
make
sure
you're
packing
a
wallop
So
one
last
time,
I'm
back
Before
it
fades
into
black
and
it's
all
over
Behold
the
final
chapter
in
the
saga
Trying
to
recapture
that
lightning
trapped
in
a
bottle
Twice
the
magic
that
started
it
all
Tragic
portrait
of
an
artist
tortured
Trapped
in
his
own
drawings
Tap
into
thoughts
Blacker
and
darker
than
anything
imaginable
Here
goes
a
wild
stab
in
the
dark
As
we
pick
up
the
last
Mathers
left
off
(Skit)
(don't
kill
me)
[shot]
Thank
you!
[Eminem
running]
Go,
go,
go
(what
the
fuck?)
What
the
fuck
are
you
doing?
Mothafucker
bail
on
me?
Fuck
you!
[car
stop
working]
Aw,
you
gotta
be
fucking
kidding
me...
Are
you
fucking
kidding
me?
Shit!
Get
off
[shot
the
dog]
(haha)
[wheezing]
The
parking
lot
Shit,
ah!
(Let
me
see
your
hands,
prank's
over)
Fuck
it!
[Shoots
himself]
(What's
your
name?)
Marshall
(Who's
your
daddy?)
I
don't
have
one
My
mother
reproduced
like
a
komodo
dragon
And
had
me
on
the
back
of
a
motorcycle
Then
crashed
in
the
side
of
loco-motive
with
rap,
I'm
loco
It's
like
handing
a
psycho
a
loaded
handgun
Michelangelo
with
a
paint
gun
in
a
tantrum
About
to
explode
all
over
the
canvas
Back
with
the
Yoda
of
rap
in
a
spasm
(Your
music
usually
has
them)
(But
waned
for
the
game
your
enthusiasm
it
hasn't
Follow
you
must,
Rick
Rubin
my
little
Padawan)
A
Jedi
in
training,
colossal
brain
and,
thoughts
of
entertaining
But
docile
and
impossible
to
explain
and,
I'm
also
vain
and
Probably
find
a
way
to
complain
about
a
Picasso
painting
(puke)
Skywalker,
but
sound
like
Chewbacca
when
I
talk
Full
of
such
blind
rage
I
need
a
seeing
eye
dog
Can't
even
find
the
page,
I
was
writing
this
rhyme
on,
(oh..)
Its
on
a
rampage,
couldn't
see
what
I
wrote
I
write
small
(It
says)
Ever
since
I
drove
a
79
Lincoln
with
white
walls
Had
a
fire
in
my
heart,
and
a
dire
desire
to
aspire,
to
DIE
HARD
So
as
long
as
I'm
on
the
clock
punching
this
time
card
Hip
hop
ain't
dying
on
my
watch
But
sometimes,
when
I'm
sleeping,
she
comes
to
me
in
my
dreams
Is
she
taken?
Is
she
mine?
Don't
got,
I
don't
care,
don't
have
two
shits
to
give
Let
me
take
you
by
the
hand,
to
promise
land,
and
threaten
everyone
Cause
there's
no
rhyme
or
no
reason
for
nothing
Nah,
(Whats
your
name?)
Marshall
(Who's
your
daddy?)
I
don't
know
him,
but
I
wonder
(Is
he
rich
like
me?)
Haha
(Has
he
taken,
any
time,
to
show
to
show
you
what
you
need
to
live?)
[Verse
2]
No,
If
he
had,
he
wouldn't
have
ended
up
in
these
rhymes
on
my
pad
I
wouldn't
be
so
mad,
my
attitude
wouldn't
be
so
bad,
yeah,
dad
Uh,
The
epitome
and
the
prime
example
of
what
happens
When
the
power
of
the
rhyme
falls
into
the
wrong
hands,
and
Makes
you
want
to
get
up
and
start
dancing
Even
if
it
is
Charles
Manson
who
just
happens,
To
be
rapping
Blue
lights
flashing,
laughing
all
the
way
to
the
bank
Lamping
in
my
K-Mart
mansion,
I'm
in
the
style
department
With
a
pile
in
my
car,
ripping
the
isle
apart
With
great
power
comes
absolutely
no
responsiblity,
for
content
Completely,
despondent,
and
conde-scen-ding
The
king
of
nonsense
and
contro-versy
in
on,
a
Beat
killing
spree,
your
honor,
I
must,
plea
Guil-ty,
cause
I
sparked
a,
Revolution
Rebel
without
a
cause,
who
caused
the
evolution
of
rap
To
take
it
to
the
next
level,
boost
it
But
several
rebuked
it,
and
whoever
produced
it
(Hip
hop
is
the
devil's
music)
Is
that
me?
It
belongs
to
me?
Cuz
I
just
happen
to
be,
a
white
honky
devil
with
two
horns
That
don't
honk
but
every
time
I
speak
you,
hear
a
beep?
But
lyrically
I
never
hear
a
peep,
not
even
a
whisper
Rappers
better
stay
clear
of
me,
bitch
Cause
its
the
[Hook]
It's
the
time
of
the
season,
when
hate
runs
high
And
this
time,
give
it
to
you
easy,
when
I
take
back
what's
mine
With
pleasured
hands,
and
torture
everyone,
that
is
my
plan
My
job
here
isn't
done,
cause
there's
no
rhyme
or
no
reason
for
nothing
(What's
your
name?)
Shady
(Who's
your
daddy?)
I
don't
give
a
fuck,
but
I
wonder
(Is
he
rich
like
me?)
Doubt
it,
ha
(Has
he
taken,
any
time,
to
show
you
what
you
need
to
live?)
[Verse
3]
So
yeah
dad
let's
walk
Let's
have
us
a
father
and
son
talk
But
I
bet
we
probably
wouldn't
get
one
block
Without
me
knocking
your
block
off
This
is
all
your
fault
Maybe
that's
why
I'm
always
so
bananas
I
appeal
to
all
those
walks
of
like
Whoever
had
strife
Maybe
that's
what
dad
and
son
talks
are
like
Cause
I
related
to
the
struggles
of
[young]
America
When
their
fucking
parents
were
unaware
of
their
troubles
Now
they're
ripping
out
their
fucking
hair
again
It's
a
stare
ruckle,
I
chuckle
Cause
everybody
bloodies
their
bare
knuckles
Yeah,
uh
oh,
better
beware
knuckleheads
The
sound
of
my
hustle
says
don't
knock
The
doors
broken,
it
won't
lock
It
might
just
fly
open,
get
cold
cocked
You
critics
come
pay
me
a
visit
Misery
loves
company,
please
stay
a
minute
Kryptonite
to
a
hypocrite
Zip
your
lip
if
you
dish
it
but
can't
take
it
Too
busy
getting
stoned
in
your
glass
house
To
kick
rocks,
then
you
wonder
why
I
lash
out
Mister
Mathers
as
advertised
on
the
flyers
So
spread
the
word
cause
I'm
promoting
my
passion
til
I'm
passed
out
A
completely
brain
dead
Rainman
Doing
a
bankhead
in
a
restraint
chair
So
bitch,
if
you
shoot
me
a
look
it
better
be
a
blank
stare
Or
get
shanked
in
the
pancreas,
I'm
angrier
than
All
8
of
the
reindeer
put
together
with
Chief
Keef
Cause
I
hate
every
fucking
thing,
yeah
Even
this
rhyme
bitch,
and
quit
tryna
look
For
a
fucking
reason
for
it
that
ain't
there
But
I
still
am
a
CRIMINAL
Ten
year
old
degenerate
grabbing
on
my
genitals
The
last
Mathers
LP
that
went
diamond
This
time
I'm
predicting
this
one
will
go
emerald
When
will
the
madness
end,
how
can
it
when
There's
no
method
the
pad
and
pen
The
only
message
that
I
have
to
sing
is:
Dad,
I'm
back
at
it
again
Bitch
[Verse
1]
Pick
up
the
god
dang
phone...
Bitch
where
the
fuck
were
you
Tuesday?
With
who
you
say?
I
wasn't
at
the
studio
Bitch
what'd
you
do
screw
Dre?
You
went
there
looking
for
me
Oo
that
excuse
is
too
lame
Keep
playing
me
you're
gonna
end
up
with
a
huge
goose
egg
You
fake,
lying
slut
you
never
told
me
you
knew
drake
Que
Lupe?
You
want
to
lose
two
legs
You
try
to
flip
this
on
me?
If
I
spent
more
time
with
you,
you
say
Ok
yeeah,
I'm
coo-coo,
hey?
Well,
screw
you
And
I'd
be
the
third
person
who
screwed
you
today
Oh,
four?
Dre,
Drake,
Lupe?
Oh
touche
You
were
too
two-faced
for
me
Thought
you
was
my
number
one
True
BlueAce
but
you
ain't
And
I
can
see
you
and
you
make
That
little
boo-boo
face
Cause
I'm
hanging
up
this
phone,
boo
You
make
my
fucking
Blutooth
ache
You
feeling
blue
too
late
Go
smurf
yourself
you
make
me
wanna
smurfin'
puke
blue
Kool
Aid
Here's
what
you
say
to
someone
you
hate
[Hook]
My
life
will
be
so
much
better
if
you
dropped
dead
(dead)
I
was
laying
in
bed
last
night
thinking
And
this
thought
just
popped
in
my
head
and
I
thought
Wouldn't
shit
just
be
a
lot
easier
if
you
dropped
dead
(dead)
I
would
feel
so
(so)
much
(much)
better
x3
[Verse
2]
Think
I
just
relapsed,
this
bitch
pushed
me
over
the
brink
Hop
on
the
freeway
trying
to
get
some
time
alone
and
just
think
Then
the
cops
pulled
me
over
but
they
let
me
go
Cause
I
told
em
I'm
only
driving
drunk
cause
that
bitch
drove
me
to
drink
I'm
back
on
my
fuck
ho's
But
a
whole
new
hatred
for
blondes,
but
bias?
I
hate
all
bitches
the
same,
baby
come
on
Excuse
the
pun
but
bitch
you're
such
a
broad
statement
And
I
am
channeling
my
anger
through
every
single
station
it's
on
Cause
a
woman
broke
my
he-art,
I
say
he-art
cause
you
ripped
it
in
two
pa-arts
And
threw
it
in
the
garbage,
who
do
you
think
you
are?
Bitch
guess
it's
time
for
me
to
get
the
dust
off
And
pick
myself
up
off
the
carpet
But
I'll
never
say
the
L-word
again
I
la-la-la-la
lesbian
*shout*
I
hope
you
hear
this
song
and
go
into
a
cardiac
arrest
My
life
would
be
so
much
better
if
you
just
[Hook]
My
life
will
be
so
much
better
if
you
dropped
dead
(dead)
I
was
laying
in
bed
last
night
thinking
And
this
thought
just
popped
in
my
head
and
I
thought
Wouldn't
shit
just
be
a
lot
easier
if
you
dropped
dead
(dead)
I
would
feel
so
(so)
much
(much)
better
x3
[Bridge]
Cuz
you
told
me,
you
love
me,
forever
Bitch,
that
was
a
lie
Now
I
never,
wanted
someone,
to
die
So
bad
in
my
fucking
life
but
fuck
it
there's
other
fish
in
the
sea
And
I'mma
have
a
whale
of
a
time
Being
a
single
sailor
for
the
night
Bitch
on
a
scale
of
1
to
10,
shit
I
must
be
the
holy
grailer
Catch
this
ho
I
got
an
Oscar
attached
to
my
fucking
name
(great)
I
might
hit
the
club
on
a
chica's
tail,
uh
Made
for
me
say
fuck
it
kick
some
shots
back
and
hammer
the
nailer
These
bitches
tryna
get
atached
with
the
failer
And
latch
him
to
the
tail
of
my
bumper
to
scratch
them
with
the
back
of
my
trailer
Like
I'm
itchin'
to
get
hitched
Yeah
I'm
rich
as
a
bitch
but
bitches
ain't
shit
I'd
rather
leave
a
bitch
in
a
ditch
Bitch
you
complain
when
you
listen
to
this
But
you
still
throw
yourself
at
me
That's
what
I
call
pitchin'
a
bitch
That's
why
I'm
swinging
at
this
chicks
on
sight
Long
as
I
got
a
bat
and
two
balls
it's
foul
But
my
dick's
on
strike
so
all
that
love
shit
is
null
and
void
Bitch
I'm
a
droid,
I
void
cupid
stupid
wasn't
for
blowjobs
you'd
be
unemployed
Oi
oi
oi
man
oh
man
you
boy
boy
boys
Getting
sick
at
these
girls
girls
girls
Oink
oink
oink
you
fucking
pigs
All
you
good
boys
doink
doink
doink
I
got
99
problems
and
the
bitch
ain't
one
She's
all
99
of
them
I
need
a
machine
gun
I
take
em
all
out
I
hope
you
hear
this
song
And
grow
into
a
cardiac
arrest
have
a
heart
attack
And
just
drop
dead
and
I'mma
throw
a
fucking
party
after
this
cause
[Hook]
My
life
will
be
so
much
better
if
you
dropped

I

[Outro]
I'm
just
playing
bitch,
you
know
I
love
you
[Hook:
Liz
Rodrigues]
This
is
survival
of
the
fittest
This
is
do
or
die
This
is
the
winner
takes
it
all
So
take
it
all
[Verse
1]
Wasn't
ready
to
be
no
millionaire,
I
was
ill-prepared
I
was
prepared
to
be
ill
though,
the
skill
was
there
From
the
beginning,
it
wasn't
'bout
the
ends
It
was
'bout
busting
raps
and
standing
for
something,
f*ck
an
acronym
Cut
the
f*cking
act
like
you're
happy,
I'm
f*cking
back
again
With
another
anthem,
why
stop
when
it
doesn't
have
to
end?
It
ain't
over
'til
I
say
it's
over

enough
when
I
say
enough
Throw
me
to
the
wolves
and
close
the
gate
up
I'm
afraid
of
what'll
happen
to
them
wolves
When
the
thought
of
being
thrown
into
an
alligator
pit,
I
salivate
at
it
Weight
is
up,
hands
up
like
it's
12
noon,
nah,
homie
Hold
them
b*tches
straighter
up,
wave
'em
'til
you
dislocate
a
rotator
cuff
Came
up
rough,
came
to
ruffle
feathers,
nah,
egos
I
ain't
deflate
enough,
last
chance
to
make
this
whole
stadium
erupt
[Hook:
Liz
Rodrigues]
This
is
survival
of
the
fittest
This
is
do
or
die
This
is
the
winner
takes
it
all
So
take
it
all
[Verse
2]
I
can
see
the
finish
line
with
each
line
that
I
finish
I'm
so
close
to
my
goals
I
can
almost
pole
vault
over
the
goal
post
And
if
I
don't
got
enough
in
the
tank,
maybe
I
can
just
siphon
enough
To
fill
up
this
last
can,
man
will
I
survive
in
this
climate
or
what?
They
said
I
was
washed
up,
and
got
a
blood
bath
I'm
not
a
rapper,
I'm
an
adapter,
I
can
adjust
Plus
I
can
just
walk
up
to
a
mic
and
just
bust
So
floor's
open
if
you'd
like
to
discuss
Top
5
in
this
mothaf*cka
and
if
I
don't
make
the
cut
What,
like
I
give
a
f*ck,
I'ma
light
this
b*tch
up
like
I'm
driving
a
truck
To
the
side
of
a
pump,
0
to
60
hop
in
and
gun
it
Like
G-Unit
without
the
hyphen,
I'm
hyping
'em
up
And
if
there
should
ever
come
a
time
where
my
life's
in
a
rut
And
I
look
like
I
might
just
give
up,
eh
you
might've
mistook
Me
for
bowing
out
I
ain't
taking
a
bow,
I'm
stabbing
myself
With
a
f*cking
knife
in
the
gut,
while
I'm
wiping
my
butt!
Cause
I
just
sh*tted
on
the
mic,
and
I
like
getting
cut
I
get
excited
at
the
sight
of
my
blood,
you're
in
a
fight
with
a
nut
Cause
I'ma
fight
'til
I
die
or
win
Biting
the
dust
it'll
just
make
me
angrier,
wait
Let
me
remind
you
of
what
got
me
this
far,
picture
me
quitting
Now
draw
a
circle
around
it
and
put
a
line
through
it,
slut
It's
survival
of
what?
[Hook:
Liz
Rodrigues]
This
is
survival
of
the
fittest
This
is
do
or
die
This
is
the
winner
takes
it
all
So
take
it
all
[Verse
3]
So
get
your
ideas,
stack
your
ammo
But
don't
come
unless
you
come
to
battle,
I'm
mad
now
jump
in
the
saddle
This
is
it,
it's
what
you
eat,
sleep,
piss
and
sh*t
Live,
breathe,
your
whole
existence
just
consists
of
this
Refuse
to
quit,
fuse
is
lit,
can't
diffuse
the
wick
I
don't
do
this
music
sh*t,
I
lose
my
sh*t
Ain't
got
sh*t
to
lose,
it's
the
moment
of
truth
It's
all
I
know
how
to
do,
as
soon
as
I
get
thrown
in
the
booth,
I
spit
But
my
respect
is
overdue,
I'm
showing
you
the
flow
no
one
do
Cause
I
don't
own
no
diploma
for
school,
I
quit!
So
there's
nothing
for
me
to
fall
back
on,
I
know
no
other
trades
So
you'd
better
trade
your
f*cking
mics
in
for
some
tool-box-es
Cause
you'll
never
take
my
pride
from
me
It'll
have
to
be
pried
from
me,
so
pull
out
your
pliers
and
your
screw-drivers
But
I
want
you
to
doubt
me,
I
don't
want
you
to
buh-lieve
Cause
this
is
something
that
I
must
use
to
suc-ceed
And
if
you
don't
like
me
then
f*ck
you!
Self
es-teem
must
be
f*cking
shooting
through-the-roof
cause
trust
me
My
skin
is
too
thick
and
bul-let
proof
to
touch
me
I
can
see
why
the
f*ck
I
disgust
you
I
must
be
a-llergic
to
failure
cause
every
time
I
come
close
to
it
I
just
sneeze,
but
I
just
go
atchoo
then
achieve!

Tell

[Verse
1:

I
used
to
be
the
type
of
kid
would
always
think
the
sky
is
falling
Why
am
I
so
differently
wired?
Am
I
a
martian?
What
kind
of
twisted
experiment
am
I
involved
in
Cause
I
don't
belong
in
this
world
That's
why
I'm
scoffing
at
authority,
defying
often
Flying
off
at
the
handle
with
my
mom,
no
dad
So
I'm
non
complying
at
home,
at
school
I'm
just
shy
and
awkward
And
no
I
don't
need
no
goddamn
psychologist
Tryna
diagnose
why
I
have
all
these
underlying
problems
Thinking
he
can
try
and
solve
'em,
I'm
outside
chalking
up
Drawings
on
the
sidewalk
and
in
the
front
drive
talking
to
myself
Either
that
or
inside
hiding
off
in
The
corner
somewhere
quiet,
trying
not
to
be
noticed
I'm
crying
and
sobbing,
I
had
a
bad
day
at
school
so
I
ain't
talking
Some
cocksucker
shoved
me
into
a
fucking
locker
'cause
he
said
I
eyeballed
him
[Bridge]
And
if
you
fall,
ill
get
you
there,
I'll
be
your
savior
from
all
the
wars
That
are
fought
inside
your
world,
please
have
faith
in
my
words
cause
[Hook]
This

I
used
to
be
the
type
of
kid
would
always
think
the
sky
is
falling
Why
am
I
so
differently
wired
in
my
noggin?
Cause
sporadic
as
my
thoughts
come,
it's
mind
boggling
Cause
I
obsess
on
everything
and
my
mind
it's
small
shit
Bothers
me
but
now
my
father,
he
said
Sayonara,then
split
But
I
don't
give
a
shit
I'm
fine
as
long
as
There's
batteries
in
my
Walkman
nothing
is
the
matter
with
me
Shit
look
at
the
bright
side
at
least
I
ain't
walking
I
bike
ride
through
the
neighborhood
of
my
apartment
Complex
on
a
ten
speed
which
I've
acquired
parts
that
I
Found
in
the
garbage,
a
frame
and
put
tires
on
it
Headphones
on
straight
ahead
and
kids
try
to
start
shit,
But
if
this
all
there
is
for
me
Life
offers
Why
bother
even
try
and
put
up
a
fight
It's
nonsense
But
I
think
a
lightbulb
just
lit
up
in
my
conscience
What
about
those
rhymes
I've
been
jottin'
They
are
kinda
giving
me
confidence
Instead
of
tryina
escape
through
my
comics,
Why
don't
I
just
blast
a
little
something
like
Onyx
To
put
me
in
the
mood
to
wanna
fight
and
write
songs
that
Say
what
I
wanna
say
to
the
kid
that
said
that
I
eyeballed
him
Grab
hold
of
my
balls
like
that's
right
fight's
on
bitch
Who
would've
knew
from
the
moment
I
turned
the
mic
on
I
could
be
iconic,
and
my
conquest
is
Word
to
Phife
Dawg
from
a
Tribe
Called
Quest

[Verse

I
used
to
be
the
type
of
kid
that,
would
always
think
the
sky
is
falling
Now
I
think
the
fact
that
I'm
differently
wired's
awesome
Cause
if
I
wasn't
I
wouldn't
be
able
to
work
Words
like
this
and
connect
lines
like
crosswords
And
use
my
enemy's
words
as
strength
To
try
and
draw
from,
and
get
inspired
off
em
Cause
all
my
life
I
was
told
and
taught
I
am
not
shit
By
you
wack
fucking
giant
sacks
of
lying
dog
shit
Now
you
shut
up
bitch
I
am
talking
Thought
I
was
full
of
horseshit
and
now
You
fucking
worship
the
ground
in
which
I
am
walking
Me
against
the
world
so
what?
I'm
Brian
Dawkins
Versus
the

So
bring

It's

Cause
you

You

With

Rawkus
You
don't
respect

I

Suck

The

ass
And
a
flying
saucer
full
of
Italian
sausage
The
most
high
exalting
and
I
ain't
halting
Till
I
die
of
exhaustion
inhale
my
exhaust
fumes
The
best
part
about
me
is
I
am
not
you
I
am
me
I'm
a
fire
marshall
and
this
is
my
[Hook]
This
is
my
legacy
(Legacy)
This
is
my
legacy
(Legacy)
There's
no
guarantee,
it's
not
up
to
me
you
can
only
see
This
is
my
legacy
(Legacy)
[Verse:1]
Came
to
the
world
at
a
time
when
it
was
in
need
of
a
villain
An
asshole,
that
role
I
think
I
succeed
in
fulfilling
Don't
think
I
ever
stopped
to
think
I
was
speaking
to
children
Everything
was
happening
so
fast,
it
was
like
I
blinked,
sold
three
million
Then
it
all
went
blank,
all
I
remember
Is
feeling
ridiculous
cause
I
was
getting
sick
of
this
feeling
Like
I
am
always
under
attack
man
I
could
have
stacked
my
shit
list
to
the
ceiling
Women
dish
him
but
really
thinking
If
anyone
ever
talks
to
one
of
my
little
girls
like
this
I
would
kill
him
Guess
I'm
a
little
bit
of
a
hypocrite
When
I'm
ripping
shit,
but
since
when
did
this
many
People
ever
give
a
shit
what
I
had
to
say
It's
just
my
opinion
If
it
contradicts
how
I'm
living
Put
a
dick
in
your
rear
end,
your
rear
end
that's
why
Every
time
you
mention
a
lyric,
I
thank
you
for
it
For
drawing
more
attention
toward
it
Cause
it
gave
me
an
enormous
platform
of
platitude
Thought
I
was
that
important
But
you
can't
ignore
the
fact
that
I
fought
for
the
respect
And
battle
for
it,
mad
awards,
(?)
annoyed
Attaboy,
they
told
me
to
slow
down,
and
I
just
zone
out
Good
luck
trying
to
convince
a
blonde
That's
like
telling
Gwen
Stefan'
that
she
sold
out
Cause
I
was
tryna
leave,
no
doubt
In
anyone's
mind
one
day
I'd
(?)
go
down
In
history
think
they
know
now
(?)
Because
everybody
knows
[Chorus
-
Skylar
Grey]
Everybody
knows
that're
just
an
asshole
Everywhere
that
you
go
People
wanna
go
home
Everyone
knows
Everybody
knows
So
don't
pretend
to
be
nice
There's
no
place
you
can
hide
You
are
just
an
asshole
Everyone
knows
Everyone
knows
[Verse
2]
Thanks
for
the
support,
asshole
*scratch*
thanks
for
the
support,
asshole
Quit
acting
salty
I
was
counting
on
you
to
count
me
out
as
Asher
Roth
When
he
round-a-bout
dissed
me
to
shout
me
out
Thought
I
was
history
But
goddamn,
honkey,
that
compliment's
like
backhanding
a
donkey
Good
way
to
get
your
ass
socked
in
the
mouth
Lay'em
off
it
But
what
the
fuck
is
all
this
thrash
talking
about
The
fight
was
fixed,
I'm
back
and
you
can't
stop
me
You
knock
me
down,
I
went
down
from
the
counter
I
fell
but
the
fans
caught
me,
and
now
You're
gonna
have
to
beat
the
fuckin
pants
off
me
To
take
my
belt,
word
to
Pacquiao
Momma
said
there
ain't
nothing
else
to
talk
about
Gotta
go
in
that
ring
and
knock
them
out
Or
you
better
not
come
out
It's
poetry
in
motion,
like
Freddie
Roach
when
he's
quoting
Shakespeare
So
what
if
the
insults
are
revolting
Even
Helen
Keller
knows
life
stinks
You
think
it's
a
joke
til
you're
bullet
riddled
But
you
should
give
little
shit
what
I
think
This
whole
world
is
a
mess
Gotta
have
a
goddamn
vest
on
your
chest,
and
a
Glock
Just
to
go
out
watch
Batman
Who
needs
to
test(?)
the
testicles,
not
that
man
Half
of
you
don't
got
the
guts
and
intestinal
blockage
Rest
of
you
got
lap
bands
stuck
to
this
model
Before
they
put
bathsalts
and
all
those
water
bottles
in
Colorado
So
get
lost,
Waldo
My
soul's
escaping
through
this
asshole
that
is
gaping
A
black
hole
that
I'm
swallowing
this
track
whole
With
a
pack
torn
of
paper
But
I'm
not
taking
no
crap,
ho
Here
I
go
down
the
back
pole
And
I'm
changing
back
into
that
old
maniac
in
fact
there
it
go
Trying
to
dip
through
the
back
door
retreating
cause
everybody
knows
[Chorus
-
Skylar
Grey]
Everybody
knows
that're
just
an
asshole
Everywhere
that
you
go
People
wanna
go
home
Everyone
knows
Everybody
knows
So
don't
pretend
to
be
nice
There's
no
place
you
can
hide
You
are
just
an
asshole
Everyone
knows
Everyone
knows
[Verse
3]
Holy
mackeral,
I'm
the
biggest
jerk
on
the
planet
earth
I
smack
the
girl
off
the
mechanical
bull,
then
attract
the
bull
Thinkin
we
have
some
magnetic
pull
Screamin
ICP
in
this
bitch,
how
do
fucking
magnets
work?
Cause
you're
attractive,
but
we
ain't
attractable
Hate
to
be
dramatical,
but
I'm
not
romantical
I'm
making
up
words
you
can
understandable,
It's
tragical
Thinkin
some
magical
shit's
gonna
happen?
That
ain't
practical
You
crackin
a
joke,
it's
laughable,
cause
me
and
love's
like
a
bad
combination
I
keep
them
feelings
locked
in
a
vault
So
it's
safe
to
say
I'm
uncrackable
My
heart
is
truly
guarded,
full
body
armor
Bitch
you
just
need
a
helmet
because
if
you
think
you're
special,
you're
retarded.
Thinkin
you're
one
of
a
kind,
like
you
got
some
platinum
vagina,
you're
a
train
wreck,
I
got
a
one
track
mind
Shorty
you're
fine
but
you
sort
of
remind
me
of
a
49er
Cause
you
been
a
gold
digger
since
you
were
a
minor
Been
tryina,
hunt
me
down
like
a
dog,
cause
you're
on
my
ass
But
you
can't
get
a
scent
because
all
of
my
spare
time
is
spent
With
my
nose
in
this
binder,
so
don't
bother
tryin
Only
women
that
I
love
are
my
daughters
And
sometimes
I
rhyme
and
it
sounds
like
I
forget
I'm
a
father,
and
I
push
it
farther
So
father
forgive
me
if
I
forget
to
draw
the
line
It's
apparent
I
shouldn't
of
been
a
parent
I'll
never
grow
up
So
to
hell
with
your
parents,
and
motherfucking
father
time
It
ain't
never
gonna
stop.
A
pessimist
who
transforms
you
to
Optimus
in
his
prime,
so
even
if
I'm
half
dead,
I'm
half
alive
Throw
all
my
half
empty
glass
in
a
cup,
so
now
my
cup
is
runneth
over
And
I'm
about
to
set
it
on
you
like
a
motherfucking
coaster
I'm
goin
back
to
what
got
me
here,
yeah
cocky,
and
can't
not
been?
rude
off?
so
fear
not
my
dear,
and
dry
up
your
teardrops
I'm
here
White
America's
mirror,
so
I
feel
awkward
and
weird,
you
stare
at
me
and
see
yourself,
because
you're
one
too.
You
shouldn't
be
as
shocked,
because
everybody
knows."
Now
this
sht's
about
to
kick
off,
this
party
looks
wack
Let's
take
it
back
to
straight
hip-hop
and
start
it
from
scratch
I'm
'bout
to
bloody
this
track
up,
everybody
get
back
That's
why
my
pen
needs
a
pad
cause
my
rhymes
on
the
ra-hag
Just
like
I
did
with
addiction
I'm
'bout
to
kick
it
Like
a
magician,
critics
I
turn
to
crickets
Got
'em
still
on
the
fence
ready
to
pick
it
But
quick
get
impaled
when
I
tell
'em
stick
it
So
sick
I'm
looking
pale,
well
that's
my
pigment
'bout
to
go
ham,
ya
bish,
shout
out
to
Kendrick
Let's
bring
it
back
to
that
vintage
Slim,
bitch!
The
art
of
the
MCing
mixed
with
da
Vinci
and
MC
Ren
And
I
don't
mean
Stimpy's
friend,
bitch
Been
public
enemy
since
you
thought
PE
was
gym,
bitch
Take
your
shoes
off,
let
your
hair
down
and
(go
berserk),
All
night
long...
Grow
your
beard
out,
just
weird
out
and
(go
berserk),
All
night
long....
We're
gonna
rock
this
house
until
we
knock
it
down
So
turn
the
volume
loud,
cause
it's
mayhem
'til
the
a.m.
So
baby
make
just
like
K-Fed
and
let
yourself
go,
let
yourself
go
Say
fck
it
before
we
kick
the
bucket
Life's
too
short
to
not
go
for
broke
So
everybody,
everybody,
shake
your
body
Guess
it's
just
the
way
that
I'm
dressed,
ain't
it?
Khakis
pressed,
Nike
shoes
just
being
fresh
laced
So
I
guess
it
ain't
Dead
after
shave
of
cologne
that
made
him
just
faint
Plus
I
just
showed
up
with
a
coat
fresher
than
wet
paint
So
if
love
is
a
chess
game,
check
mate
But
girl
your
body's
banging,
jump
me
in,
bang
--
bang,

Yessiree

P-p-p-pow

Catch

Slow

Dumb

I
don't

At

I

I

Question

bozos
smart
enough
to
feel
stupid
Hope

Take

Grow

Life's
too
short

So
everybody,
everybody,
get
your
vials
They
say
that
love
is
powerful
as
cough
syrup
and
Styrofoam
All
I
know
is
I
fell
asleep
and
woke
up
in
that
Monte
Carlo
With
the
ugly
Kardashian
Lamar,
oh
sorry
yo,
we
done
both
set
the
bar
low
Bars
hard,
drugs
hard
thought
that's
the
past
But
I
done
did
enough
codeine
to
knock
Future
into
tomorrow
And
girl
I
ain't
got
no
money
to
borrow
But
I
am
tryin'
to
find
a
way
to
get
you
alone,
car
note!
Oh,
Marshall
Mathers
shouldn't
everybody
know
Get
the
bar
soap
lathered,
came
ghost
and
called
Arthur's
Cargo's
Girl
you're
fixin'
to
get
your
heart
broke,
don't
be
absurd
man
You
bird
brained
baby
I
ain't
called
anybody
baby
since
Birdman
Unless
you're
a
swallow
Word,
w-word
man
you

but
don't
be
discouraged
girl
This
is
your
jam,

Take

Life's
too
short
to
not
go
for
broke
So
everybody,
everybody,
get
your
vials
Look,
I
was
gonna
go
easy
on
you
not
to
hurt
your
feelings
But
I'm
only
going
to
get
this
one
chance
Something's
wrong,
I
can
feel
it
Six
minutes.
Six
Minutes.
Six
minutes,
Slim
Shady,
you're
on!
Just
a
feeling
I've
got
Like
something's
about
to
happen,
but
I
don't
know
what
If
that
means
what
I
think
it
means
We're
in
trouble,
big
trouble
And
if
he
is
as
bananas
as
you
say,
I'm
not
taking
any
chances
You
are
just
what
the
doc
ordered
I'm
beginnin'
to
feel
like
a
Rap
God,
Rap
God
All
my
people
from
the
front
to
the
back
nod,
back
nod
Now
who
thinks
their
arms
are
long
enough
to
slap
box,
slap
box?
They
said
I
rap
like
a
robot,
so
call
me
rap-bot
But
for
me
to
rap
like
a
computer
must
be
in
my
genes
I
got
a
laptop
in
my
back
pocket
My
pen'll
go
off
when
I
half-cock
it
Got
a
fat
knot
from
that
rap
profit
Made
a
livin'
and
a
killin'
off
it
Ever
since
Bill
Clinton
was
still
in
office
With
Monica
Lewinsky
feelin'
on
his,
nutsack
I'm
an
MC
still
as
honest
But
as
rude
and
as
indecent
as
all
hell
Syllables,
skill-a-holic
(Kill
'em
all
with)
This
flippity
dippity-hippity
hip-hop
You
don't
really
wanna
get
into
a
pissin'
match
with
this
rappity-rap
Packin'
a
MAC
in
the
back
of
the
Ac'
Backpack
rap
crap,
yap-yap,
yackety-yack
And
at
the
exact
same
time
I
attempt
these
lyrical
acrobat
stunts
while
I'm
practicing
that
I'll
still
be
able
to
break
a
mothafuckin'
table
Over
the
back
of
a
couple
of
faggots
and
crack
it
in
half
Only
realized
it
was
ironic
I
was
signed
to
Aftermath
after
the
fact
How
could
I
not
blow?
All
I
do
is
drop
F-bombs
Feel
my
wrath
of
attack
Rappers
are
having
a
rough
time
period,
here's
a
maxi
pad
It's
actually
disastrously
bad
for
the
wack
While
I'm
masterfully
constructing
this
master
piece
Cause
I'm
beginnin'
to
feel
like
a
Rap
God,
Rap
God
All
my
people
from
the
front
to
the
back
nod,
back
nod
Now
who
thinks
their
arms
are
long
enough
to
slap
box,
slap
box?
Let
me
show
you
maintainin'
this
shit
ain't
that
hard,
that
hard
Everybody
want
the
key
and
the
secret
To
rap
immortality
like
I
have
got
Well,
to
be
truthful
the
blueprint's
Simply
rage
and
youthful
exuberance
Everybody
loves
to
root
for
a
nuisance
Hit
the
Earth
like
an
asteroid
Did
nothing
but
shoot
for
the
Moon
since
(Pew)
MC's
get
taken
to
school
with
this
music
Cause
I
use
it
as
a
vehicle
to
"bus
the
rhyme"
Now
I
lead
a
new
school
full
of
students
Me?
I'm
a
product
of
Rakim,
Lakim
Shabazz,
2Pac,
N.W.A.,
Cube,
hey,
Doc,
Ren,
Yella,
Eazy,
thank
you,
they
got
Slim
Inspired
enough
to
one
day
grow
up
Blow
up
and
be
in
a
position
To
meet
RunD.M.C.,
and
induct
them
Into
the
mothafuckin'
Rock
'n
Roll
Hall
of
Fame
Even
though
I'll
walk
in
the
church
and
burst
in
a
ball
of
flames
Only
Hall
of
Fame
I'll
be
inducted
in
is
the
alcohol
of
fame
On
the
wall
of
(shame)
You
fags
think
it's
all
a
game,
'til
I
walk
a
flock
of
flames
Off
a
plank
and,
tell
me
what
in
the
fuck
are
you
thinkin'?
Little
gay-looking
boy
So
gay
I
can
barely
say
it
with
a
straight
face,
looking
boy
You're
witnessing
a
massacre,
like
you're
watching
a
church
gathering
take
place,
looking
boy
"Oy
vey,
that
boy's
gay!",
that's
all
they
say,
looking
boy
You
get
a
thumbs
up,
pat
on
the
back
And
a
"way
to
go"
from
your
label
every
day,
looking
boy
Hey,
looking
boy,
what
you
say,
looking
boy?
I
get
a
"hell
yeah"
from
Dre,
looking
boy
I'ma
work
for
everything
I
have,
never
ask
nobody
for
shit
Get
outta
my
face,
looking
boy!
Basically,
boy,
you're
never
gonna
be
capable
Of
keeping
up
with
the
same
pace,
looking
boy
Cause
I'm
beginnin'
to
feel
like
a
Rap
God,
Rap
God
All
my
people
from
the
front
to
the
back
nod,
back
nod
The
way
I'm
racing
around
the
track,
call
me
NASCAR,
NASCAR
Dale
Earnhardt
of
the
trailer
park,
the
White
Trash
God
Kneel
before
General
Zod
This
planet's
Krypton;
no,
Asgard,
Asgard
So
you
be
Thor
and
I'll
be
Odin,
you
rodent,
I'm
omnipotent
Let
off
then
I'm
reloadin'
Immediately
with
these
bombs
I'm
totin'
And
I
should
not
be
woken;
I'm
the
walking
dead
But
I'm
just
a
talking
head,
a
zombie
floatin'
But
I
got
your
mom
deep
throatin'
I'm
out
my
Ramen
Noodle
We
have
nothing
in
common,
poodle
I'm
a
Doberman,
pinch
yourself
in
the
arm
And
pay
homage,
pupil
It's
me,
my
honesty's
brutal
But
it's
honestly
futile
if
I
don't
utilize
what
I
do
though
For
good
at
least
once
in
a
while
So
I
wanna
make
sure
somewhere
in
this
chicken
scratch
I
scribble
and
doodle
enough
rhymes
To
maybe
try
to
help
get
some
people
through
tough
times
But
I
gotta
keep
a
few
punchlines
Just
in
case,
cause
even
you
unsigned
Rappers
are
hungry
looking
at
me
like
it's
lunchtime
I
know
there
was
a
time
where
once
I
Was
king
of
the
underground
But
I
still
rap
like
I'm
on
my
Pharoahe
Monch
grind
So
I
crunch
rhymes,
but
sometimes
when
you
combine
Appeal
with
the
skin
color
of
mine
You
get
too
big
and
here
they
come
tryin'
to
Censor
you,
like
that
one
line
I
said
on
"I'm
Back"
from
the
Mathers
LP
1
when
I
tried
to
say
"I'll
take
seven
kids
from
Columbine
Put
'em
all
in
a
line,
add
an
AK-47,
a
revolver
and
a
9"
See
if
I
get
away
with
it
now
that
I
ain't
as
big
as
I
was,
but
I'm
Morphin'
into
an
immortal,
coming
through
the
portal
You're
stuck
in
a
time
warp
from
2004,
though
And
I
don't
know
what
the
fuck
that
you
rhyme
for
You're
pointless
as
Rapunzel
with
fucking
Cornrows
You
write
normal?
Fuck
being
normal
And
I
just
bought
a
new
raygun
from
the
future
Just
to
come
and
shoot
ya
Like
when
Fabolous
made
Ray
J
mad
Cause
Fab
said
he
looked
like
a
fag
at
Mayweather's
pad
Singing
to
a
man
while
they
played
piano
Man,
oh
man,
that
was
a
24/7
special
on
the
cable
channel
So
Ray
J
went
straight
to
the
radio
station
The
very
next
day,
"Hey
Fab,
I'ma
kill
you!"
Lyrics
coming
at
you
at
supersonic
speed
(J.J.
Fad)
Uh,
summa-lumma,
dooma-lumma
You
assuming
I'm
a
human
What
I
gotta
do
to
get
it
through
to
you?
I'm
superhuman
Innovative
and
I'm
made
of
rubber
So
that
anything
you
say
is
ricocheting
off
of
me
And
it'll
glue
to
you
and
I'm
devastating,
more
than
ever
demonstrating
how
to
give
a
mothafuckin'
audience
a
feeling
like
it's
levitating
Never
fading,
and
I
know
the
haters
are
forever
waiting
For
the
day
that
they
can
say
I
fell
off,
they'll
be
celebrating
Cause
I
know
the
way
to
get
'em
motivated
I
make
elevating
music,
you
make
elevator
music
"Oh,
he's
too
mainstream"
Well,
that's
what
they
do
when
they
get
jealous
They
confuse
it;
"It's
not
hip-hop,
it's
pop"
Cause
I
found
a
hella
way
to
fuse
it
With
rock,
shock
rap
with
Doc
Throw
on
"Lose
Yourself"
and
make
'em
lose
it
"I
don't
know
how
to
make
songs
like
that
I
don't
know
what
words
to
use"
Let
me
know
when
it
occurs
to
you
While
I'm
ripping
any
one
of
these
verses
that
versus
you
It's
curtains,
I'm
inadvertently
hurting
you
How
many
verses
I
gotta
murder
to
Prove
that
if
you
were
half
as
nice
Your
songs
you
could
sacrifice
virgins
to?
Ungh,
school
flunky,
pill
junkie
But
look
at
the
accolades
these
skills
brung
me
Full
of
myself,
but
still
hungry
I
bully
myself,
cause
I
make
me
do
what
I
put
my
mind
to
And
I'm
a
million
leagues
above
you
Ill
when
I
speak
in
tongues
But
it's
still
tongue-in-cheek,
fuck
you!
I'm
drunk,
so
Satan,
take
the
fucking
wheel!
I'm
asleep
in
the
front
seat
Bumpin'
Heavy
D
and
the
Boyz,
still
"Chunky
but
Funky"
But
in
my
head
there's
something
I
can
feel
tugging
and
struggling
Angels
fight
with
devils
and
here's
what
they
want
from
me
They're
asking
me
to
eliminate
some
of
the
women
hate
But
if
you
take
into
consideration
the
bitter
hatred
I
have
Then
you
may
be
a
little
patient
and
more
sympathetic
To
the
situation
and
understand
the
discrimination
But
fuck
it,
life's
handing
you
lemons
Make
lemonade
then!
But
if
I
can't
batter
the
women
How
the
fuck
am
I
supposed
to
bake
them
a
cake
then?
Don't
mistake
him
for
Satan;
it's
a
fatal
mistake
If
you
think
I
need
to
be
overseas
And
take
a
vacation
to
trip
a
broad
And
make
her
fall
on
her
face
and
Don't
be
a
retard,
be
a
king?
Think
not
Why
be
a
king
when
you
can
be
a
God?

[Verse

I
walk
around
like
a
space
cadet,
place
your
bets
Who's
likely
to
become
a
serial
killer?
Case
of
tourettes
Fuck,
fuck,
fuck!
Can't
take
the
stress
I
make
a
mess
as
the
day
progresses
Angry
and
take
it
out
on
the
neighbours
hedges
Like
this
is
how
I'll
cut
your
face
up
bitches
With
these
hedge
trimming
scisors
with
razor
edges
Imagination's
dangerous,
it's
the
only
way
to
escape
this
Mess
and
make
the
best
of
this
situation,
I
guess
Cuz
I
feel
like
a
little
bitch's,
predicaments,
despicable
I'm
sick
of
just
getting
pushed,
it's
ridiculous
I
look
like
a
freaking
wuss,
a
pussy
This
kid
just
took
my
stick
of
liquorice
And
threw
my
sticker
books
in
a
picker
bush
I
wanna
kick
his
toosh,
but
I
was
six
and
shook
This
fucker
was
12
and
was
6
foot,
with
a
vicious
hook
He
hit
me,
I
fell,
I
got
back
up,
all
I
did
was
book,
now
there's
using
your
head
[Hook]
Mama
always
said
'If
you
had
a
brain,
you'd
be
dangerous
A
brain
you'd
be
dangerous'
(Mama
could
be
wrong)
Mama,
Ima
grow
a
name
and
be
famous
And
I'mma
be
a
pain
in
the
anus
(Mama
could
be
wrong)
I'mma
use
my
head
as
a
weapon
Find
a
way
to
escape
this
insaneness
Mama
always
said
'Son,
If
you
had

[Verse
2]
Fast
forward
some
years
later
A
teenager,
this
is
a
fun,
sweet
I
just
got
jumped
twice
in
one
week,
it's
complete
It's
usually
once
a
month,
this
is
some
feat
I've
accomplished
They've
stomped
me
into
the
mud
[gee]
for
what
reason,
you
stomped
me
But
how
do
you
get
the
shit
beat
out
of
you,
be
down
and
be
upbeat
When
you
don't
have
no-thing,
no
valid
shot
at
life
Chance
To
make
it
or
succeed
Cuz
you're
doomed
from
the
start
It's
like
you
grew
up
on
drug
street,
from
jump
street
But
if
I
had
just
kept
my
head
up
my
ass
I
could
accomplish
any
task
Practicing
trash
talking
in
a
trance
Locked
in
my
room
yeah
But
I
got
some
plans
mama
These
damn
rhymes
are
falling
Out
of
my
pants
pocket
I
can't
stop
it
And
I'm
starting
to
blend
in
more,
school
this
shit
helps
for
sure
I'm
getting
more
self
assured
than
I've
ever
been
before
Plus
no
one
picks
on
me
anymore,
I
done
put
a
stop
to
that
Threw
my
first
punch,
end
of
story
Still
in
my
skulls
a
vacant,
empty
void
Been
using
it
more
as
a
bin
for
storage
Take
some
inventory
and
as
gorge
as
a
Ford
engine
door
hinge
syringe
an
orange
an
extension
cord
and
a
Ninja
sword
Not
to
mention
four
lynch
pins
and
a
stringent
stored
ironing
board
a
bench
a
wrench
or
winch
and
a
tangent
whore
Everything
but
a
brain,
but
dome's
off
the
fucking
chain
Like
an
independent
store,
something's
wrong
with
my
head
Just
think
if
I
had
a
brain
in
it,
thank
God
that
I
don't
Cause
I'd
probably
be
dahmer
cause
mama
always
said
[Hook]
Mama
always
said
'If

[Bridge]
Now
my
mum
goes
womp
womp
womp
Cause
I'm
not
that
smart
but
I'm
not
dumb
I
was
on
a
bottom
of
the
pile
getting
stomped
But
somehow,
I
came
out
on
top
[Verse
3]
I
told
you
one
day,
I
said
they'd
have
that
red
carpet
rolled
out,
yo
I'm
nice,
yo,
fuck
it
I'm
out
cold
Now
everywhere
I
go,
they
scream
out
'Go'
I'm
bout
to
clean
house,
yo
I'm
Lysol,
now
I'm
just
household
Outsold
the
sell
outs,
freak
the
hell
out
Middle
America,
hear
them
yell
out
[until]
they
were
so
scared,
and
those
kids
Just
about,
belted
out
Whatever
spout
that
it
fell
out
Of
my
smart
alleck
mouth,
it
was
so
weird
Inappropriate,
so
be
it,
I
don't
see
it
Maybe
one
day
when
the
smoke
clears,
it
won't
be
as
Motherfuckin'
difficult,
ch'yea,
til
then
Hopefully
you
little
homos
get
over
your
fears
and
grow
beards
It's
okay
to
be
scared
straight,
they
said
I
provoke
queers
Til
emotions
evoke
tears,
my
whole
careers
a
stroke
of
sheer
genius
Smoke
and
mirrors,
tactical,
practical
jokes,
yeah
You
motherfuckin'
Insert
insult
here
Who
the
fuck
would've
thunk
that
one
little
lone
MC
would
be
able
to
take
the
whole
culture
and
re-upholstery
it
And
boy
they
did
flock
Can't
believe
this
little
hick
locked
This
hip
hop
shit
in
his
pocket
and
still
the
shit
got
That
white
trash
traffic
and
gridlock
Shit
happened
like
a
six
blocks
from
a
Kid
Rock
Insane
Clown
Posse
Concert
in
mid
Oc-tober
And
got
forbid
I
see
a
wizard
and
get
a
brain
in
my
titanium
cranium
dog
Cause
I
turn
into
the
unabomber

[Outro]
Insaneness
ain't
even
a
word
you
stupid
fuck
[Marshal
Mathers]
Neither
is
ain't
[Verse
1]
You
used
to
say
that
I'd
never
be
nothing
without
you
And
I
believe
I'm
shot
in
the
lungs,
I
gasp,
I
can't
breathe
Just
lay
here
with
me,
baby,
hold
me
please
And
I
beg
and
I
plead,
drop
to
knees
And
I
cry
and
I'd
scream,
baby,
please
don't
leave
Snatch
the
keys
from
your
hand
I
would
squeeze
and
you'd
laugh
And
you'd
tease,
you're
just
fucking
with
me
And
you
must
hate
me
Why
do
you
date
me
if
you
say
I
make
you
sick?
And
you've
had
enough
of
me
I
smother
you,
I'm
'bout
to
jump
off
the
edge
[Hook]
But
you
won't
break
me
You'll
just
make
me
stronger
than
I
was
Before
I
let
you,
I
bet
you
I'll
be
just
fine
without
you
And
if
I
stumble,
I
won't
crumble
I'll
get
back
up
and
uhhh
And
I'mma
still
be
humble
when
I
scream
fuck
you
Cause
I'm
stronger
than
I
was
[Verse
2]
A
beautiful
face
is
all
that
you
had
Cause
on
the
inside
you're
ugly,
man
But
you're
all
that
I
love
Aggressed,
you
can't
leave
Please
stay
here
with
me,
baby,
hold
me
please
And
I'd
beg
and
I
plead,
drop
to
knees
And
I'd
cry
and
I'd
scream,
baby,
please
don't
leave
Cause
you
left
and
you
took
everything
I
had
left
And
left
nothing,
nothing
for
me
So
please
don't
wake
me
from
this
dream,
baby
We're
still
together
in
my
head
And
you're
still
in
love
with
me
Till
I
woke
up
to
discover
that
that
dream
was
dead
[Hook]
But
you
won't
break
me
You'll
just
make
me
stronger
than
I
was
Before
I
let
you,
I
bet
you
I'll
be
just
fine
without
you
And
if
I
stumble,
I
won't
crumble
I'll
get
back
up
and
uhhh
And
I'mma
still
be
humble
when
I
scream
fuck
you
Cause
I'm
stronger
than
I
was
[Verse
3]
You
walked
out,
I
almost
died
It
was
almost
a
homicide
that
you
caused
cause
I
was
so
traumatized
Felt
like
I
was
in
for
a
long
bus
ride
I'd
rather
die
than
you
not
be
by
my
side
Can't
count
how
many
times
I
vomited,
cried
Go
to
my
room,
turn
the
radio
on
and
hide,
uh
We
were
Bonnie
and
Clyde
No,
on
the
inside
you
were
Jekyll
and
Hyde
I
Felt
like
my
whole
relationship
with
you
was
a
lie
It
was
you
and
I,
why
did
I
think
it
was
ride
or
die?
Cause
if
you
could've
took
my
life
you
would've
It's
like
you
put
a
knife
to
my
chest
and
pushed
it
right
through
to
the
Other
side
of
my
pack
and
stuck
a
spike,
too,
should've
Put
up
more
of
a
fight,
but
I
couldn't
at
the
time
No
one
could
hurt
me
like
you
could've
Take
you
back
now,
what's
the
likelihood
of
that?
Bite
me,
bitch,
chewing
on
a
nineteen
footer
Cause
this
morning
I
finally
stood
up
Held
my
chin
up,
finally
showed
a
sign
of
life
in
me
for
the
First
time
since
you
left
me
and
left
me
with
nothing
but
shattered
dreams
And
a
life
we
could've
had
and
we
could've
been
But
I'm
breaking
out
of
this
slump
I'm
in
Pulling
myself
out
of
the
dumps
once
again
I'm
getting
up
once
and
for
all,
fuck
this
shit
I'mma
be
late
for
the
pity
party
But
you're
never
gonna
beat
me
to
the
fucking
punch
again
Took
it
on
the
chin
like
a
champ
so
don't
lump
me
in
with
the
chumpy
ends
I'm
done
being
your
punching
bag
It
was
the
November
31st
today,
would've
been
our
anniversary
Two
years,
but
you
left
on
the
first
of
May
I
wrote
it
on
the
calender,
was
gonna
call,
but
couldn't
think
of
the
words
to
say
But
it
came
to
me
just
now,
so
I
put
'em
in
a
verse
to
lay
And
I
thank
you
cause
you
made
me
a
better
person
than
I
was
But
I
hate
you
cause
you
drained
me
I
gave
you
all,
you
gave
me
none
But
if
you
blame
me,
you're
crazy
And
after
all
that's
said
and
done
I'm
still
angry,
yeah,
I
maybe
I
may
never
trust
someone
[Hook]
But
you
won't
break
me
You'll
just
make
me
stronger
than
I
was
Before
I
let
you,
I
bet
you
I'll
be
just
fine
without
you
And
if
I
stumble,
I
won't
crumble
I'll
get
back
up
and
uhhh
And
I'mma
still
be
humble
when
I
scream
fuck
you
Cause
I'm
stronger
than
I
was
I'm
friends
with
the
monster
That's
under
my
bed
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
You're
trying
to
save
me
Stop
holding
your
breath
And
you
think
I'm
crazy
Yeah,
you
think
I'm
crazy
(crazy)
I
wanted
the
fame,
but
not
the
cover
of
Newsweek
Oh
well,
guess
beggers
can't
be
choosey
Wanted
to
receive
attention
for
my
music
Wanted
to
be
left
alone
in
public
excuse
me
Been
wanting
my
cake,
And
eat
it
too
And
wanting
it
both
ways
Fame
made
me
a
balloon
cause
my
ego
inflated
When
I
blew
seep
and
it
was
confusing
Cause
all
I
wanted
to
do
is
be
the
Bruce
Lee
of
loose
leaf
Abused
ink,
used
it
as
a
tool
when
I
blew
steam
Hit
the
lottery
(oh
wee)
With
what
I
gave
up
to
get
was
bittersweet
It
was
like
winning
a
huge
meet
Ironic
'cause
I
think
I'm
getting
so
huge
I
need
a
shrink
I'm
beginning
to
lose
sleep:
one
sheep,
two
sheep
Going
cuckoo
and
cookey
as
Kool
Keith
But
I'm
actually
weirder
than
you
think
Cause
I'm...
I'm
friends
with
the
monster
That's
under
my
bed
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
You're
trying
to
save
me
Stop
holding
your
breath
And
you
think
I'm
crazy
Yeah,
you
think
I'm
crazy
Well,
that's
nothing
oh
oh
oh
oh
Well,
that's
nothing
oh
oh
oh
oh
Now
I
ain't
much
of
a
poet
But
I
know
somebody
once
told
me
to
seize
the
moment
And
don't
squander
it
Cause
you
never
know
when
it
could
all
be
over
Tomorrow
so
I
keep
conjuring
Sometimes
I
wonder
where
these
thoughts
spawn
from
(Yeah,
ponder
it,
do
you
want
this?
there's
no
wonder
you're
losing
your
mind
the
way
you're
wandering?)
I
think
you've
been
wandering
off
down
yonder
and
stumbled
onto
Jeff
VanVonderen
Cause
I
needed
an
interventionist
to
intervene
between
me
and
this
monster
And
save
me
from
myself
and
all
this
conflict
Cause
the
very
thing
that
I
love
is
killing
me
and
I
can't
conquer
it
My
OCD
is
conking
me
in
the
head
Keep
knocking,
nobody's
home,
I'm
sleepwalking
I'm
just
relaying
what
the
voice
in
my
head
saying
Don't
shoot
the
messenger,
I'm
just
friends
with
the...
I'm
friends
with
the
monster
That's
under
my
bed
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
You're
trying
to
save
me
Stop
holding
your
breath
And
you
think
I'm
crazy
Yeah,
you
think
I'm
crazy
Well,
that's
nothing
oh
oh
oh
oh
Well,
that's
nothing
oh
oh
oh
oh
Call
me
crazy,
but
I
had
this
vision
One
day
that,
I'd
walk
amongst
you
a
regular
civilian
But,
until
then,
drums
get
killed
and
I'm
Coming
straight
at
Emcees,
blood
get
spilled
and
I
Take
it
back
to
the
days
that,
I
get
on
a
Dre
track
Give
every
kid
who
got
played
at
Pumped
the
feeling
and
shit
to
say
back
To
the
kids
who
played
'em
I
ain't
here
to
save
the
fucking
children
But
if
one
kid
out
of
a
hundred
million
Who
are
going
through
a
struggle
feels
and
it
relates
that's
great
It's
payback,
Russell
Wilson
falling
way
back
In
the
draft,
turn
nothing
into
something
still,
can
make
that
Straw
in
the
gold
chump
I
will
spend
Rumpelstiltskin
in
a
hay
stack
Maybe
I
need
a
straightjacket,
face
facts
I
am
nuts
for
real,
but
I'm
okay
with
that
It's
nothing,
I'm
still
friends
with
the...
I'm
friends
with
the
monster
That's
under
my
bed
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
You're
trying
to
save
me
Stop
holding
your
breath
And
you
think
I'm
crazy
Yeah,
you
think
I'm
crazy
I'm
friends
with
the
monster
That's
under
my
bed
(Get
along
with)
Get
along
with
the
voices
inside
of
my
head
(You're
tryna)
You're
trying
to
save
me
Stop
holding
your
breath
And
you
think
I'm
crazy
Yeah,
you
think
I'm
crazy
Well,
that's
nothing
[Intro]
I
own
a
mansion,
but
live
in
a
house
A
king-size
bed,
but
I
sleep
on
the
couch
I'm
Mr.Brightside,
glass
is
half
full
But
my
tank
is
half
empty,
gasket
just
blew
[Verse
1]
This
always
happens,
30
minutes
from
home
Gotta
lay
a
log
cabin
and
only
option
I
have
is
McDonald's
bathroom
In
a
public
stall
dropping
a
football
So
every
time
someone
walks
in
the
john
I
get
Madden
''Shady,
what
up?''-
What?
Come
on,
man,
I'm
crapping
And
you're
asking
me
for
my
got
damn
autograph
on
a
napkin?
Oh,
that's
odd,
I
just
happened
to
run
out
of
tissue
Yeah,
hand
me
that,
on
second
thought
I'd
be
glad
then
''Thanks,
dawg,
name's
Todd,
a
big
fan''
I
wiped
my
ass
with
it,
crumbled
it
up
in
a
wad
and
threw
it
back
and
Told
him
''Todd,
you're
the
shit''
when
does
all
of
this
crap
end?
Can't
park
my
ass
without
causing
an
accident
Puff
my
gas,
cut
my
grass,
can't
take
out
the
fucking
trash
Without
someone
passing
through
my
sub
harassing
I'd
count
my
blessings,
but
I
suck
at
math
I'd
rather
wallow
then
bass
suffering
from
succotash
But
the
antacid
is
my
stomach
gas
I
mix
my
corn
with
my
fucking
mash
Potato,
so
what,
ho,
kiss
my
country
bumpkin
ass
Missouri
Southern
roots,
what
the
fuck
is
upperclass
Call
lunch
dinner,
call
dinner
supper
Tupperware
in
a
covered
plastic
wear
up
the
ass
Stuck
in
the
past,
iPod,
what
the
fuck
is
that?
B-boy
to
the
core,
mule,
I'm
a
stubborn
ass
[Hook]
Maybe
that's
why
I
feel
so
strange
Got
it
all,
but
I
still
won't
change
Maybe
that's
why
I
can't
leave
Detroit
It's
the
motivation
that
keeps
me
going
This
is
the
inspiration
I
need
I
can
never
turn
my
back
on
a
city
that
made
me
(Life's
been
good
to
me
so
far)
[Verse
2]
They
call
me
classless,
I
heard
that,
I
second
and
third
that
Don't
know
what
the
fuck
I
would
doing
if
it
weren't
rap
Probably
be
a
giant
turd-sack
But
I
blew,
never
turned
back
Turned
40
and
still
sag
Teenagers
act
more
fucking
mature,
Jack
Fuck
you
gonna
say
to
me?
I
leave
on
my
own
terms,
asshole,
I'm
going
berzerk
My
nerves
are
bad,
but
I
love
the
perks
my
work
has
I
get
to
meet
famous
people,
look
at
her,
dag
Her
nylons
ran,
her
skirt
snag
And
I
heard
she
drag-races,
*burp*
swag
Fucking
my
Hanes
shirt
tag
You're
Danica
Patrick
(yeah)
work,
skag
We'd
be
the
perfect
match
Cause
you're
a
vacuum,
I'm
a
dirtbag
My
apologies,
no
disrespect
to
technology
But
what
the
heck
is
all
of
these
buttons?
You
expect
me
to
sit
here
and
learn
that?
Fuck
I
gotta
do
to
hear
this
new
song
from
Luda?
Be
an
expert
at
computers?
I'd
rather
be
an
encyclopedia
Britannica,
hell
with
a
Playstation
I'm
still
on
my
first
manual
from
Zelda
Nintendo,
bitch,
run,
jump,
punch,
stab
and
I
melt
the
Mozzarella
on
my
spaghetti,
put
in
on
bread
Make
a
sandwich
with
welch's
and
belch
They
say
this
spray
butter
is
bad
for
my
health,
but
I
think
there's
more
white
trash
from
the
trailer
Jed
Clampett,
Redd
Sanford
welfare
mentality
helps
to
Keep
me
grounded,
that's
why
I
never
take
full
advantage
of
wealth,
I
Managed
to
dwell
within
these
parameters
Still
cramming
the
shelves
full
of
hamburger
helper
I
can't
even
help
it,
this
is
the
hand
I
was
dealt
to
Creature
of
habit,
feel
like
I'm
trapped
in
an
animal
shelter
With
all
these
pet
peeves
God
dammit
to
hell,
I
can't
stand
all
these
kids
with
their
camera
cellphones
I
can't
go
anywhere,
I
get
so
mad
I
can
yell,
the
Other
day
someone
got
little
elaborate
and
stuck
a
fucking
dead
cat
in
my
mailbox
Went
to
Burger
King,
they
spit
on
my
onion
rings
I
think
my
karma
is
catching
up
with
me
[Hook]
Maybe
that's
why
I
feel
so
strange
Got
it
all,
but
I
still
won't
change
Maybe
that's
why
I
can't
leave
Detroit
It's
the
motivation
that
keeps
me
going
This
is
the
inspiration
I
need
I
can
never
turn
my
back
on
a
city
that
made
me
(Life's
been
good
to
me
so
far)
[Bridge]
Got
friends
on
facebook,
all
over
the
world
Not
sure
what
that
means,
they
tell
me
it's
good
So
I'm
artist
of
the
decade,
I
even
got
a
plaque
I'd
hang
it
up,
but
the
frame
is
all
cracked
[Verse
3]
I'm
trying
to
be
lowkey,
hopefully
nobody
notices
me
In
produce
hunched
over,
giant
nosebleed
Over
stop
as
I
mosey
over
to
the
frozen
aisle
By
the
frozen
yogurt
this
guy
approached
me
Embarrassed,
I
just
did
Comerica
with
Hova
Show's
over,
I'm
hiding
in
Kroeger
buying
groceries
He
just
had
front
row
seats,
told
me
to
sign
this
poster
Then
insults
me
"wow,
up
close
didn't
know
you
had
crow's
feet"
I'm
at
a
crossroad
lost
till
shopping
at
Costco
Sloppy
Joe's,
buck
waffles
Got
caught
picking
my
nose,
ah
Look
over
see
these
two
hot
hoes
Finger
still
up
in
one
of
my
nostrils
Right
next
to
'em
stuck
at
the
light
This
fucking
shit
is
taking
forever
to
change
I'm
stuck,
these
bitches
are
loving
it
rubbing
it
in
Chuckling,
couldn't
do
nothing,
play
it
off
''What
you
bumping?
Trunk
Muzik?
Yelawolf's
better'',
fucking
bitch
They
want
me
to
flip
at
the
label,
but
I
won't
succumb
to
it
The
pressure,
they
want
me
to
follow
up
with
another
one
after
Recovery
Was
so
highly
coveted,
but
what
good
is
a
fucking
recovery
if
I
fumble
it?
Cause
I'mma
drop
the
ball
if
I
don't
get
a
grip
Hopping
on
shrubbery
on
you
sons
of
bitches
Wrong
subdivison
to
fuck
with,
bitch
Quit
snapping
fucking
pictures
of
my
kids
I
love
my
titty,
but
you
push
me
to
my
limit,
what
a
pity
The
shit
I
complain
about
It's
like
there
ain't
a
cloud
in
the
sky
and
it's
raining
out
Kool
Aid
stain
on
the
couch,
I'd
never
get
it
out
Bitch,
I
got
an
elevator
in
my
house
Ants
and
a
mouse,
I'm
living
the
dream
[Hook]
Maybe
that's
why
I
feel
so
strange
Got
it
all,
but
I
still
won't
change
Maybe
that's
why
I
can't
leave
Detroit
It's
the
motivation
that
keeps
me
going
This
is
the
inspiration
I
need
I
can
never
turn
my
back
on
a
city
that
made
me
(Life's
been
good
to
me
so
far)
[Verse
1
-
Eminem]
Somethin's
burnin',
I
can't
figure
out
what
It's
either
lust
or
a
cloud
of
dust
Judgement
is
clouded,
must
just
be
the
powder
from
the
power
of
love
But
I'm
in
somethin'
I
don't
know
how
to
get
out
of
Left
my
girl
in
the
house
alone
Is
that
my
soon
to
be
spouse's
moan
And
the
further
I
walked
allowed
her
I
paused
for
a
minute
to
make
something,
that's
what
I
heard
Cuz
after
all
this
is
her
place
So
I
gave
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
Think
I
might
be
about
Busta
Busta
The
thought's
so
scary,
yo
that
it
hurts,
brace
Hope
it
ain't,
there
we
go,
yo
Cause
my
head
already
goes
to
worst
case
scenario,
though,
in
the
first
place
But
you
confirmed
my
low
end
theory,
though
Should've
known
when
I
made
it
all
the
way
to
third
base
And
that
was
only
the
first
date,
coulda
made
it
to
home
plate
But
you
slid
straight
for
the
dome
and
dove
face
first
No,
you
don't,
under,
stand,
I,
don't,
do
this
for
Anyone,
ever,
Yeah
that
ain't
what
they
all
say
I'll
say
it,
you
can
suck
a
softball
through
a
straw,
used
to
be
my
fiance
'Til
you
sucked
on
Wayne,
Andre,
and
Kanye
Lebron,
Akon,
Jay,
Lil
Jon,
Raekwon,
Ma$e
Polow
Tha
Don,
Drake,
Dante
Ross,
James
Conway,
Kwame
Guess
I'm
gettin
my
goddamn
Jigga
on
Cause
your
name,
I'm
beyond
sayin'
But
fuck
it,
I'm
movin'
on,
you
women
are
all
cray
But
I'll
probably
always
keep
on
playin'
the
game
of
Love,
love,
love,
love
L-l,
l-l-l-love
[Hook
-
Kendrick
Lamar]
She
doesn't
love
me,
no
she
don't
love
me
no
more
She
hates
my
company,
yeah
she
don't
love
me
no
more
I
tried
to
get
her
up
out
of
my
head
as
my
bags
hit
the
door
She
screamed
she
loves
me
like
she
never
did
before
[And
I
told
her
go
where
you
want
And
go
do
what
you
want
to
do.
I
don't
care]x2
[Verse
2:
Kendrick
Lamar]
I
told
that
bitch
I'm
a
sucker
for
love,
you're
a
sucker
for
dick
Suckin'
dick
in
your
momma's
tub
'til
your
granny
walked
in
Told
the
stupid
nigga
to
duck
under
the
water,
he
drowned
Like
an
abortion,
they
booked
you
for
manslaughter
You
beat
the
case
and
I
called
you
"Sherane
is
not
available
now
leave
a
message
at
the
tone
And
Kendrick
don't
forget
to
buy
two
pair
of
those
Expensive
heels,
you
little
fuckin'
ferris
wheel
Fuckin'
spendin'
on
me,
fuck

Fuckin'
Mary

a
little
lamb,

fairy
tale
Fairy
godmomma

tell
you
how
I
fuckin'

Like
you
should
fuckin'
beat
it
or
fuckin'
eat
it
while
I'm
on
my
period
Now
have
a
blessed
day"
Bitch
you
serious?
I'm
in
the
mirror
with
this
look
on
my
face,
curious
Why
you
ain't
fuckin'
with
me,
you
cut
me
up,
a
Caesarean
You
know
I
want
you
bad
as
a
Benjamin,
I'm
delirious
I
want
you
bad
as
the
head
shattered
on
George
Zimmerman
After
the
dillinger
hit'em
diligently
and
killin'
him
His
mouthpiece
for
a
Cadillac
emblem
That's
analogy
and
metaphor
for
yah
I
should
win
a
medal
for
all
the
ways
I
adore
yah
This
is
me
talkin'
poetry,
yeah
I
got
some
home
trainin'
That
ain't
what
you
like,
ain't
it?
What
about
if
I
was
famous
As
Marshall,
would
you
give
fellatio
in
the
carpool
Cops
pull
us
over,
they
just
wanna
know
if
you
gargle,
singin'
I
hope
she's
good
enough,
meanwhile
you're
chasin'
her
Chlamydia
couldn't
even
get
rid
of
her
Pity
the
fool
that
pity
the
fool
in
me,
I'mma
live
with
the
game
of
Love,
love,
love,
love
L-l,
l-l-l-love
[Hook
-
Kendrick
Lamar]
She
doesn't
love
me,
no
she
don't
love
me
no
more
She
hates
my
company,
yeah
she
don't
love
me
no
more
I
tried
to
get
her
up
out
of
my
head
as
my
bags
hit
the
door
She
screamed
she
loves
me
like
she
never
did
before
[And
I
told
her
go
where
you
want
And
go
do
what
you
want
to
do.
I
don't
care]x2
[Verse
3:
Eminem]
So
needless
to
say
I'm
feeling
betrayed
Snatched
my
housekey
off
my
keychain
She
jumped
off,
Wee-Bey
from
The
Wire,
escape
Now
she's
chasin'
me
with
a
cheese
grater
Here
goes
that
broken
record,
cliche,
it's
all
my
fault
anyway
She's
turnin'
the
tables,
I'm
a
beat-break
Treats
my
face
like
seratos,
she
cuts
and
scratches
like
a
DJ
Each
day
is
an
instant
replay
They
sayin'
we
display
cinethematic
abatic
behavior
Back
together
but
forgot
today
was
her
b-day,
cut
me
off
on
the
freeway
Simple
misunderstandin'
but
just
as
I
went
to
slam
on
the
brakes
Then
I
realized
that
she
may
be
as
crazy
as
me,
wait
Bitch
cut
my
fuckin'
brakeline,
stepped
on
them
fuckers
8
times
Still
goin'
73,
thank
God
there's
an
exit
coming
up
But
them
other
F-U-C-K's
all
would
of
hit
the
off
ramp
So
I
coast
into
a
gosh
damned
aww
hit
a
fuckin'
tree
Now
here
she
comes
at
full
speed,
she's
racin'
at
me
Okay
you
wanna
fuck
with
me,
eh?
Snatch
the
bitch
out
her
car
through
the
window,
she
screamin'
I
body
slam
her
onto
the
cement,
until
the
concrete
gave
and
created
a
sinkhole
Bury
this
stink
ho
in
it,
then
payed
to
have
the
street
re-paved
Fuck,
woke
up
in
a
dream
state
in
a
cold
sweat
Like
I
got
hit
with
a
freeze
ray
durin'
a
heat
wave
Guess
I
eventually
caved
though,
cause
she's
layin'
next
to
me
in
bed
Directly
aimin'
a
gat
at
my
head
Woke
up
again
and
jumped
up
like
fuck
it,
I've
had
it,
I'm
checkin'
into
rehab
I
confess
I'm
a
static
addict,
I
guess
that's
why
I'm
so
clingy
Every
girl
I've
ever
had
either
says
I
got
to
much
baggage
Or
I'm
just
too
dramatic
Man
what
the
fuck
is
the
matter?
I'm
just
a
fucking
romantic
I
fucking
love
you,
you
fucking
bitch!
Combative,
possessive,
in
fact
last
time
I
was
mad
at
an
ex
I
actually
set
off
a
chain
reaction,
a
tragic
event
I
said
"hit
the
road"
and
after
she
left
I
sent
that
bitch
a
text
I
said
"be
careful
driving,
don't
read
this
and
have
a
accident"
She
glanced
to
look
at
it
and
write,
too
bad
Thought
we
had
a
connect
No
sense
dwelling
makes,
never
been
a
more
compelling
case
Than
a
model
covered
in
L'Oreal
and
mace,
who
fell
from
grace
Eleven
stories
for
story
telling
but
the
whore
was
yelling
"rape"
So
the
vocal
cords
were
swelling
And
her
voice
were
more
hoarser
than
Tori
Spelling's
face
Still
they
swarm
the
gates
and
my
fans
making
stakes
To
greet
Norman
Bates
with
a
warm
embrace
Unless
you're
Andrea
Yates,
don't
ask
me
for
a
date,
don't
be
late
Well
the
sentiments
great,
but
wait
then
there's
been
a
mistake
You
want
an
intimate
date,
I
wanna
intimidate
I
have
infinite
hate
in
my
blood,
it's
mainly
because
of
the
game
of
Wait
dinner
at
eight
I
have
infinite
hate
in
my
blood,
it's
mainly
because
of
the
game
of
Love,
love,
love,
love
L-l,
l-l-l-love
Mom,
I
know
I
let
you
down
And
though
you
say
the
days
are
happy
Why
is
the
power
off,
and
I'm
fucked
up?
And
mom,
I
know
he's
not
around
But
don't
you
place
the
blame
on
me
As
you
pour
yourself
another
drink
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
I
went
in
headfirst
Never
thinking
about
who
what
I
said
hurt,
in
what
verse
My
mom
probably
got
it
the
worst
The
brunt
of
it,
but
as
stubborn
as
we
are
Did
I
take
it
too
far?
Cleaning
out
my
closet
and
all
them
other
songs
But
regardless
I
don't
hate
you
cause
ma!
You're
still
beautiful
to
me,
cause
you're
my
mom
Though
far
be
it
for
you
to
be
calling,
my
house
was
Vietnam
Desert
Storm
and
both
of
us
put
together
can
form
an
atomic
bomb
Equivalent
to
Chemical
warfare
And
forever
we
can
drag
this
on
and
on
But,
agree
to
disagree
That
gift
from
me
up
under
the
Christmas
tree
don't
mean
shit
to
me
You're
kicking
me
out?
It's
15
degrees
and
it's
Christmas
Eve
(little
prick
just
leave)
ma,
let
me
grab
my
fucking
coat
Anything
to
have
each
other's
goats,
why
we
always
at
each
others
throats?
Especially
when
dad,
he
fucked
us
both
We're
in
the
same
fucking
boat
You'd
think
that
it'd
make
us
close
(nope)
Further
away
that
drove
us,
but
together
headlights
shine
A
car
full
of
belongings
Still
got
a
ways
to
go,
back
To
grandma's
House
it's
straight
up
the
road
And
I
was
the
man
of
the
house,
the
oldest
So
my
shoulders
carried
the
weight
Of
the
load
Then
Nate
got
taken
away
by
the
state
at
8
years
old,
and
That's
when
I
realized
you
were
sick
and
it
wasn't
fixable
or
changable
And
to
this
day
we
remained
estranged
and
I
hate
it
though,
but
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
Cause
to
this
day
we
remain
estranged
and
I
hate
it
though
Cause
you
ain't
even
get
to
witness
your
grand
baby's
growth
But
I'm
sorry
mama
for
Cleaning
Out
My
Closet,
at
the
time
I
was
angry
Rightfully
maybe
so,
never
meant
that
far
to
take
it
though,
cause
Now
I
know
it's
not
your
fault,
and
I'm
not
making
jokes
That
song
I
no
longer
play
at
shows
and
I
cringe
every
time
it's
on
the
radio
And
I
think
of
Nathan
being
placed
in
a
home
And
all
the
medicine
you
fed
us
And
how
I
just
wanted
you
to
taste
your
own,
but
Now
the
medications
taken
over
and
your
mental
states
deteriorating
slow
And
I'm
way
too
old
to
cry,
that
shit's
painful
though
But
ma,
I
forgive
you,
so
does
Nathan
yo
All
you
did,
all
you
said,
you
did
your
best
to
raise
us
both
Foster
care,
that
cross
you
bare,
few
may
be
as
heavy
as
yours
But
I
love
you
Debbie
Mathers,
oh
what
a
tangled
web
we
have,
cause
One
thing
I
never
asked
was
where
the
fuck
my
deadbeat
dad
was
Fuck
it
I
guess
he
had
trouble
keeping
up
with
every
address
But
I'd
have
flipped
every
mattress,
every
rock
and
desert
cactus
Own
a
collection
of
maps
and
followed
my
kids
to
the
edge
of
the
atlas
Someone
ever
moved
them
from
me?
That
you
could
bet
your
ass's
If
I
had
to
come
down
the
chimney
dressed
as
Santa,
kidnap
them
And
although
one
has
met
their
grandma
Once
you
pulled
up
in
our
drive
one
nights
As
we
were
leaving
to
get
some
hamburgers
Me,
her
and
Nate,
we
introduced
you,
hugged
you
And
as
you
left
I
had
this
overwhelming
sadness
come
over
me
As
we
pulled
off
to
go
our
separate
paths,
and
I
saw
your
headlights
as
I
looked
back
And
I'm
mad
I
didn't
get
the
chance
to
thank
you
for
being
my
Mom
and
my
Dad
So
Mom,
please
accept
this
as
a
tribute
I
wrote
this
on
the
jet
I
guess
I
had
to
get
this
off
my
chest
I
hope
I
get
the
chance
to
lay
it
before
I'm
dead
The
stewardess
said
to
fasten
my
seatbelt,
I
guess
we're
crashing
So
if
I'm
not
dreaming,
I
hope
you
get
this
message
That
I'll
always
love
you
from
afar,
cause
you're
my
mama...
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
I
want
a
new
life,
one
without
a
cause
So
I'm
coming
home
tonight,
well,
no
matter
what
the
cost
And
if
the
plane
goes
down,
and
if
the
crew
can't
wake
me
up
Just
know
that
I
was
alright,
and
I
was
not
afraid
to
die
Even
if
there's
songs
to
sing,
my
children
will
carry
me
Just
know
that
I'm
alright,
I
was
not
afraid
to
die
Because
I
put
my
faith
in
my
new
girl,
so
I
never
say
goodbye
cruel
world
Just
know
that
I'm
alright,
I
am
not
afraid
to
die
I
guess
we
are
who
we
are
Headlights
shining
in
the
dark
night
I
drive
on
Maybe
we
took
this
too
far
I
want
a
new
life
[Intro]
Yeah,
trying
to
figure
out
the
difference
But
I
think..
I
think
the
lines
are
starting
to
get
blurry
[Verse
1]
I'm
in
a
strange
place
I
feel
like
Mase
when
he
gave
up
the
game
for
his
faith
I
feel
like
I'm
caged
in
these
chains
and
restraints
Grinning
every
stranger
in
the
place
while
I
gaze
into
space
Cause
I'm
mentally
rearranging
his
face
I
need
a
change
of
pace
cause
the
pace
I'm
working
at
is
dangerous
There's
nowhere
to
dump
this
anger
and
thanks
to
this
angst
I
done
quit
chicken
heads
in
cold
turkey
and
started
slowly
roasting
'em
Cause
that's
where
most
of
my
anger
is
based
Fuck
your
feelings,
I
feel
like
I
play
for
the
Saints
I
just
want
to
hurt
you,
aim
for
the
skanks
Then
aim
for
all
these
fake
Kanye's,
Jay's,
Wayne's
and
the
Drake's
I'm
frustrated
cause
ain't
no
more
N'Sync,
now
I'm
all
out
of
wack
I'm
all
out
of
Backstreet
Boys
to
call
out
and
attack
I'm
going
all
out
in
this
rap
shit
and
whatever
the
fallout
is
I'm
strapped
for
battles,
suck
a
duck,
crawl
out
the
back,
bar
fight
Prepare
your
arsenal
and
beware
of
bar
stools
flying
through
the
air
And
bottles
breaking,
mirrors
also
And
I
ain't
stopping
'til
the
swear
jar's
full
You
done
called
every
woman
a
slut,
but
you
forgetting
Sarah,
Marshall
(Palin!)
Oh
my
bad,
slut
And
next
time
I
show
up
in
court
I'll
be
naked
and
square
a
lawsuit
Judge
be
like
"that's
sharp,
how
much
that
motherfucker
cost
you?
Smart
ass,
you
lucky
I
don't
tear
it
off
you
And
jmp
your
bones,
you
sexy
motherfucker
You
so
fucking
gravy,
Marshall,
I
should
start
calling
you
au
jus
Cause
all
you
do
is
spit
them
lyrics
out
the
wazoo
Evil
twin,
take
this
beat
now,
it's
on
you''
I
believe
people
can
change,
but
only
for
the
worse
I
could've
changed
the
world
if
it
wasn't
for
this
verse
So
satanic
K-Mart
chains
panic
Cause
they
can't
even
spin
back
the
curse
words
Cause
they're
worse
when
they're
reversed,
motherfucker
(I
fuck
em
-
rape
your
mother)
And
these
kids
are
like
parrots
They
run
around
the
house
just
like
terrorists
Screaming
"fuck,
shit,
fuck"
Adult
with
a
childish
like
arrogance
Wild
ever
since
the
day
I
came
out
I
was
like
"merits,
fuck
that"
I'd
rather
be
loud
and
I
like
swearing
From
the
first
album
even
the
gals
were
like
"tight
lyrics,
dreamy
eyes"
But
my
fucking
mouth
was
nightmare-ish
And
from
the
start
of
it
you
felt
like
you
were
a
part
of
this
And
the
opposition
felt
the
opposite
Sometimes
I
listen
and
revisit
them
old
albums
Often
as
I
can
and
skim
through
all
them
bitches
To
make
sure
I
keep
up
with
my
competition
Hogger
of
beats,
hoarder
of
rhymes
Borderline
genius
who's
bored
of
his
lines
And
that
sort
of
defines
where
I'm
at
and
the
way
I
feel
now
Feel
like
I
might
just
strike
first
and
ignore
the
replies
[Hook]
This
darkness
comes
in
me
(Evil
twin)
And
comes
again
That
ain't
me
He's
just
a
friend
who
pops
up
now
and
again
So
don't
blame
me,
blame
him
I
step
out
and
see
my
evil
twin,
he
gives
me
an
evil
grin
[Interlude]
Welcome
back
to
the
land
of
the
living,
my
friend
You
have
slept
for
quite
some
time
[Verse
2]
So
who's
left?
Lady
Gaga?
Messed
with
the
Bieber
Nah,
F
with
Christina,
I
ain't
fucking
with
either
Jessica
neither
Simpson
or
Alba,
my
albums
just
sicker
than
struck
with
the
fever
Get
the
cloriseptic
Excedrin
aleve
or
extra
strength
Tylenol
3's
Feel
like
I'm
burning
to
death,
but
I'm
freezin'
Bed
ridden
and
destined
to
never
leave
the
Bedroom
ever
again
like
the
legend
of
Heather
Ledger
My
suicide
notes,
barely
legible
read
the
Bottom,
it's
signed
by
The
Joker
Lorena
said
I
never
can
leave
her
She'd
sever
my
wiener
I
ever
deceive
her
Fuck
that
shit,
bitch
Give
up
my
dick
for
pussy,
I'd
be
Jerry
Mathers
I'ever
left
it
at
beaver
Get
them
titties
cut
off
trying
to
mess
with
the
cleaver
Golly-wally,
I
bet
he
registered
Jesus
Ever
since
1-9-9-4-6
Dresden
it
was
definite
lean
My
destiny
went
on
the
steps,
I
met
Deshaun
at
Osborn
I'd
never
make
it
to
sophomore
I
just
wanted
to
skip
school
and
rap,
used
to
mop
floors
Flip
burgers
and
wash
dishes,
but
I
wrote
rhymes
trying
to
get
props
for
'em
Cause
I
took
book-smarts
and
swapped
for
'em
They
was
sleeping,
I
made
them
stop
snorin'
Made
them
break
out
the
popcorn
Now
I've
been
hip
hop
in
its
tip
top
form
Since
N.W.A.
was
blaring
through
my
car
windows
leaning
on
the
horn
Screaming
''fuck
the
police''
like
cop
porn
Flipped
rap
on
its
ear
like
I
dropped
corn
Fuck
top
5,
bitch,
I'm
top
4
ANd
that
includes
Biggie
and
Pac,
whore
And
I
got
an
evil
twin,
so
who
do
you
think
that's
3rd
and
that
4th
spot's
for?
And
as
crazy
as
I
am
I'm
much
tamer
than
him
And
I'm
nuts,
then
again
who
the
fuck
wants
a
plain
Eminem?
But
no
one's
insaner
than
Slim,
look
at
that
evil
grin
(evil
twin)
Please
come
in,
what
was
your
name
again?
Hi,
faggot
Look
who's
back
with
a
crab
up
his
ass
like
a
lobster
crawled
up
there
Two
rabbits,
a
koala
bear
and
a
ball
of
hair
And
you're
all
aware
I
ain't
got
it
all
upstairs
Guess
that's
why
I'm
an
addict
and
it's
just
small
up
there
Peace
to
Whitney,
geez,
just
hit
me
That
I
should
call
the
looney
police
to
come
get
me
Cause
I'm
so
sick
of
being
the
truth
I
wish
somebody
finally
admit
me
Into
a
mental
hospital
with
Britney
Oh,
LMFAO,
no
way,
ho
Jose
Baez
couldn't
beat
this
rap,
OJ
no
Hooray,
I'm
off
the
hook
like
Casey
Anthony
Hey
ho,
hey
ho
I
sound
like
I'm
trying
to
sing
the
fucking
chorus
to
hip
hop
hooray
No
I'm
hollering
you
got
bottom-end
like
an
808
And
a
[bass]
whether
we're
fucking
off
that
instead
of
your
face,
so
Let
the
low
end
raise,
yo
Tango,
what
you
think,
ho?
Slow
dancing
or
bowling
You
trying
to
hold
hands
with
your
homie?
What?
You
think
I'm
looking
for
romance
cause
I'm
lonely?
Change
that
tune,
you
ain't
got
remote
chance
to
control
me
Ho,
I'm
only
vulnerable
when
I
got
a
boner
Superman
tried
to
fuck
me
over,
it
won't
hurt
Don't
try
to
fix
me,
I'm
broke
so
I
don't
work
So
are
you,
but
you're
broke
cause
you
don't
work
But
all
bullshit
aside
I
hit
a
stride
Still
Shady
inside,
hair
every
bit
is
dyed
As
it
used
to
be
when
I
first
introduced
y'all
to
my
skittish
side
And
blamed
it
on
him
when
they
tried
to
criticize
Cause
we
are
the
same,
bitch
[Verse
1]
One
thousand
different
houses
and
munchausen
I'mma
make
you
wanna
punch
out
some
fuckin'
one
"ouch"
What
the
fuck'd
you
hit
me
for?
Scream
life
as
I
punch
counter
and
bunches
out
of
anger
I
once
encountered
a
stranger
In
a
dumb
gown,
black
hood
With
a
scythe
Shit
I
laughed
in
his
face
spit
Bitch
gave
me
an
extra
life,
like
take
this
Now
get
your
ass
back
in
that
game
Bitch
don't
take
shit
for
granted
And
don't
take
shit,
give
it!
Only
bull
you
should
take
is
by
the
horns
A
mixture
of
Whitey
Ford
and
mighty
Thor
I
Everlast,
pen
is
mightier
than
sword
Finish
writing
then
record
Replenish
keep
writing
more
Nothing's
riding
on
it
but
your
privates
are
you're
fighting
for
So
you
fight,
scratch,
you
claw
Backs
to
wall
No
one
was
there
to
catch
you
fall
You
pick
yourself
back
up,
you
dust
your
jacket
off
You
grab
your
balls,
like
they're
gargantuan
and
Ask
yourself
how
fucking
bad
you
want
it
Pull
out
your
pants,
whoop
your
ass
and
flash
it
on
em'
Nobodies
gonna
back
you
in
the
corner
Throw
a
hornet
No
one's
more
ig-norant
then
you
fuckin'
four
in
the
morning
you're
at
the
laboratory,
storming
Like
there's
nothing
that's
more
important
MC's
you
better
consider
this
a
formal
warning,
you're
in
for
it
Girl,
what
would
you
do
if
I
said
your
body
was
off
the
chain?
And
I
told
you
I
smile
every
single
time
I
saw
your
face
I
ain't
finished
bitch
I
meant
in
half,
oil
the
blades
Nobody
wants
to
play
They
say
I'm
a
spoiled
little
baby
But
[Hook]
Nobody
put's
baby
in
the
corner
I'm
only
trying
to
warn
ya
Cus
that
baby
get's
mad
And
get's
to
throwing
a
tantrum
He'll
fucking
flip
on
ya
Cus'
nobody
put's
baby
in
the
corner
I'm
only
trying
to
warn
ya
Cus
that
baby
get's
mad
And
get's
to
throwing
a
tantrum
He'll
fucking
flip
on
ya
[Verse
2]
What
goes
through
an
addict's
brain?
Besides
static
pain
and
big
daddy
kane
Break,
beats
and
words
An
erratic
train
of
thought
Like
splatter
paint
Scatter
brain
Yeah
maybe
why
that
explains
Why
you're
back
but
you
don't
rap
the
same
And
you're
looking
way
thinner
Because
your
hunger
got
you
looking
like
They
took
away
dinner
Sugar
ray
leonard
wouldn't
sugar
coat
a
fucking
booger
though
Just
to
wipe
that
bitch
on
a
hooker's
coat
When
you
say
you're
a
chooka
what
chooka
what
Now
fling
that
bitch
from
your
fingertips
I
hope
it
lands
on
another
rap
singers
lips
Who
can't
think
of
shit
Anything
of
wit,
that's
interesting
to
spit
Whose
king
of
this
fucking
English
Lit?
Let
your
middle
fingers
flip
On
each
hand,
whilst
extending
this
shit
How
low
can
you
go?
Lower
then
Chuck
D
ho
Hear
the
bass
of
this
in
my
voice
Rocky's
back,
where's
my
Adrian?
Nobodies
crazy
as
shady
in
an
eighty
million
mile
radius
I'm
what
Tom
Brady
is
to
the
patriots
of
rap
Not
a
man,
I'm
a
weapon
Who
just
happened
to
be
a
rapper
Who
just
happen
to
be
on
the
crapper
When
it
happened
I
had
an
epiphany
In
the
bathroom,
I'd
never
be
the
same
after
Now
I'm
back
with
an
apper-tite
For
destruction
the
fucking
recipe
for
disaster
So
let's
eat
cos'
I'm
famished
Every
deed
is
a
dastardly
one
Evil
its
past
it
Even
you
asking
for
me
to
be
pulled
Like
to
people
Is
like
me
having
my
teeth
pulled
[Hook]
[Verse
3]
So
step
inside
of
dimension
The
demented
side
of
a
mind
That's
like
the
inside
of
an
engine
While
I
multiply
your
undivided
attention
But
be
reminded
that
if
I
didn't
mention
I
lose
my
mind
and
my
temper
You'll
be
the
first
one
Who
finds
him
offensive
Got
him
climbing
the
fences
Lost
some
time
to
addiction
But
look
up
rhyme
in
the
dictio-nary
I'm
in
the
picture
Eminem
is
the
synonym
for
it
I'm
an
enigma
Fuck
it
let's
get
to
the
meat,
balls
I'm
gonna
skip
the
veg
and
potatoes
Edgamacater,
they
are
Shit
legends
are
madea
Spit
treachreous
data
Shit
that
you
would
say
to
your
worst
enemy
This
wretchedness
is
What
you
get
when
you
mix
Treach
with
a
Jada
And
combine
em'
with
Method
Man
and
Redman
Whit
meth-amphetamines
in
his
left
hand
And
in
his
right
there's
a
sledge-hammer
And
pajamas,
standing
in
front
of
a
webcam
Beating
himself
in
the
head,
til
Russell
let's
him
off
dead
jam
Maybe
I
need
my
head
examined
Hannibal
Lecter
with
a
dead
lamb
Hanging
from
his
ceiling
dripping
with
a
bed
pan
I
need
meds!
Swear
to
god
cus'
If
I
go
off
the
edge
T.I
ain't
talking
me
off
a
ledge
man
Heart
throb
at
a
fart,
ah
nah
More
like
a
smart
slob,
part
blob
That'll
stab
you
with
a
sharp
ob-ject
To
the
heart
and
leave
claw
marks
All
over
the
Wal-Mart
walls
Little
baby
with
large
balls
Fuck
mud
slinging,
I'm
blood
flinging
There's
nothing
on
this
fucking
earth
better
then
being
King
of
the
playground
I
hate
the
swings
but
I
love
being
the
underdog
Cos
when
I'm
pushed
I
end
up
swinging
up
[Verse
1:
Eminem]
Girl
you
gimme
writers
block
I'm
at
a
loss
for
words
My
minds
as
lost
as
yours
I
rack
my
brain
but
still
no
thoughts
emerge
Never
seen
no
ass
as
large
as
yours,
how
much
that
cost?
That's
what
I
call
a
Roethlisberger
You
drive
me
bonkers
I'm
about
to
get
my
swerve
on
for
sure
Thought
I
was
pimpin
until
I
felt
like
Nas,
the
first
date
Because
I
think
I
gave
you
power
when
I
gave
you
flowers
And
I
bought
us
a
box
of
chocolates,
no
lozenges
or
cough
drops
or
???
Probably
should
of
never
let
me
call
that
job
of
yours
To
talk
to
your
boss
and
ask
him
if
you
can
take
off
from
work
Should
of
been
one
of
the
first
signs
to
cause
to
learn
Man
we
jumped
in
too
fast,
cause
since
then
I
can't
be
apart
from
her
Cause
nobodies
body's
awesomer
-
I
lust
it,
and
she
loves
me
cause
I'm
popular,
but...
[Hook:
Jamie
N
Commons]
You
know
this
ain't
love
Oh,
no,
you
know
this
ain't
love
You
know
this
ain't
love
No,
this
ain't
love
(What
is
it
then?)
It's
desperation
She's
lookin
for
Mr.
Right,
wants
me
to
be
that
guy
to
her
(It's
desperation)
I
can't
even
put
up
a
fight,
cause
I
give
in
at
the
sight
of
her
[Verse
2:
Eminem]
Well
obviously,
oblivious
to
me,
I
swore
I
was
just
invisible
to
you
til
I
went
to
the
lengths
I
did
to
meet
you
Cause
you
played
so
hard
to
get
with
me
from
the
beginning
Now
I'm
in
disbelief
I,
never
knew
that
this
could
be
such
misery
Cause
now
you
see
nothin
but
me,
and
I
don't
see
nothin
but
you
And
I'm
about
to
flip
cause
we
are
super
glued
in
We
stuck
to
each
others
hips
and
we
can't
do
anything
individually
Which
is
to
cling
on,
scared
to
be
alone,
can't,
specifically
to
describe
it
I
just
can't
seem
to
give
a
reason
this
definitive,
just
need
you
Talkin
bout
"I
live
and
breathe
you"
And
you
pretend
to
be
as
mentally
and
physically
addicted
to
me
As
Wiz
Khalifa
is
to
reefer
Don't
wanna
be
without
you,
don't
wanna
be
with
you
neither,
bitch
Put
me
in
a
situation
in
which
it's
both
I
wish
to
seek,
cause
this
ain't...
[Hook]
...and
here
I
go
again
[verse
3:
Eminem]
Just
want
you
to
myself,
don't
wanna
share
you
with
no
one
else
What
the
fuck
you
whispering
for?
You
get
on
my
nerves,
you
make
me
sick
I
think
our
relationship,
it
seems
to
be
on
the
fritz
I
mean
it's
time
that
we
just
split
and
leave
the
games
behind
Your
frame
of
mind
ain't
the
same
as
mine,
I
think
You
need
to
finish
developing
a
little
more
mentally
too,
get
the
picture?
That's
a
negative,
Alicia,
I
will
never
give
the
Keys
up
To
the
crib,
ever
again,
no
reason
not
even
a
gift
certificate
from
Tiffany's
You
better
have
an
epiphany,
slut,
guess
what?
(what)
???
I'm
just
mad
it
took
the
time
it
took
me
to
discover
You
been
using
me
for
loot
like
I
used
you
for
looks
Thought
you
was
too
good
for
me,
huh?
???
used
to
be
my
Carrie
Underwood,
I
was
your
lumberjack,
but
I
can't
stomach
this
I'm
leavin
you,
not
comin
back.
She
said
"The
fuck
with
that
Where's
my
Louisville
Slugger
at?"
She
grabbed
that
fuckin
bat
and
swung
it
at
my
head
I
barely
ducked
and
that's
right
when
she
came
up
with
a
kick
to
the
nuts
twice
Steel
toe,
girl
probably
coulda
put
a
100
yard
field
goal,
through
the
uprights
[Hook]
[Intro]
What
is
a
nightmare?
The
dictionary
tells
us
it
is
a
terrifying
dream,
a
nightmare
[Verse
1]
I
used
to
think
I
had
bad
luck,
but
I
wasn't
superstitious
Till
one
day
I
grew
suspicious,
when
I
stepped
on
a
crack
on
Aunt
Edna's
stoop
And
got
pooped
on
by
a
group
of
stupid
pigeons
Then
we
flew
the
coop
to
Michigan
to
start
a
new
be-ditching
Missouri
from
Michigan
didn't
work
So
we
moved
back
to
Missouri
from
Michigan,
from
Missouri
back
to
Michigan
Someone
put
me
out
my
misery,
I
can't
do
this
again
Mom
please
stick
to
a
decision
Discipline,
last
thing
I
wanna'
do
is
listen
she's
like
Lex
Luthor,
bitch,
her
rules
are
kryptonite
To
the
walls
and
I've
lost
my
power
to
see
through
them
bitches
But
I
run
into
them,
running
through
the
kitchen
Pretending
to
be
blind,
Superman
Cos
I
had
no
supervision
But
I
did
have
a
super
power
though
I
could
turn
into
invisible
kid
Disappear
out
of
sight,
like
a
true
magician
And
one
day
uncle
Ronnie
brought
over
this
new,
but
different
Music
into
the
picture
and
it
become
my
new
religion
"I
remember
it
clearly,
even
today"
Move
back
to
Michigan
again,
to
live
with
my
Grandma
Ned
Always
itchin'
for
something
to
do,
was
flipping
Through
the
radio
stations
one
day
And
discovered
this
DJ
who
was
mixing
I
say
it
to
this
day,
if
you
ain't
listened
to
the
wizard
You
ain't
have
a
fucking
clue
what
you
was
missing
I'd
zone
out
with
my
headphones,
all
I
remember
doing's
wishing
For
shoes,
fuck
them
stupid
pumas
bitch,
it's
all
about
them
new
edition
You
get
the
new
LL
Cool
J
Think
I
finally
maneuvered
to
8
Mile
and
[?Hoover]
and
somehow
I
found
my
future
is
in
this
That's
how
I
know
my
mission
Little
boom
box
boomin',
spitting
Practicing
numerous
rhythms
When
I
sit
in
my
room
envisioning
my
dreams
come
true
for
wishin'
I
remember
Proof
would
visit
Couldn't
wait
to
play
him
my
new
shit,
he'd
go
complete
ballistic
Go
through
the
roof
for
his
shit
It's
like
we
knew
the
instant
We
touched
a
mic
that
both
of
us
two
existed
to
do
this
shit
Never
quit,
too
persistent
Started
a
group
of
misfits
Proof
had
a
proposition
If
we
all
brand
together,
there
ain't
no
stopping
this
shit
Come
up
with
aliases,
bipolar
opposites
and
Be
ready
to
come
off
the
top
as
sharp
position
If
you
got
dissed
at
the
shop
cause
if
they
caught
you
slippin'
They'd
take
your
spot
if
someone
got
to
rippin'
you
And
you
forgot
your
written
Opportunity
knocked
us
once,
it
ain't
knocking
again
It
tried
dong
ditching
shit
I
fucking
got
that
bitch
in
a
headlock
Cut
off
his
oxygen
Slim
[??]
Now
I
got
my
pot
to
piss
in
I'm
in
a
league
Muhammad's
in
All
these
[?]
bombing
them
Probably
end
up
on
top
of
them
Stomping
them
like
Ndamukong
I'm
rushing
at
the
Flow
vomits
in
your
face
Competitors
fall
at
my
waist
You
spit
a
rhyme,
I
spit
in
a
rhyme's
face
So
name
the
time,
place
to
battle
Bitch
I'm
still
in
that
mind
state
Don't
make
me
step
on
you
and
make
you
wine
grapes
Cry
babies,
maybe
my
way
that
I
use
words
is
loose
But
you
turds
better
be
careful
how
you
choose
yours
Cause
feelings
scar
but
egos
bruise
worse
And
the
truth
hurts,
shit
no
wonder
you're
sore
losers
Ooh,
no
more
trippin
in
bird
shit,
this
songs
a
self
empowerment
surgeon
Words
of
encouragement
but
this
[?]
The
rap
games
God,
but
the
name's
not
James
Todd?,
I'm
just
a
wordsmith
So
let
these
words
lift
Cos
all
I
got
is
bars
for
you
dumbbells
and
doors
ain't
working
out
Each
verse
is
more
[?]
than
the
first
And
you
ain't
got
to
wear
no
shoes
and
shirt
in
this
beast?
to
get
served
They
shall
not
escape
my
vengeance
And
I'm
the
kid
with
them
ears
like
Dumbo's
gone
Word
to
Uncle
Ron
I'm
turning
into
an
unhumble
Don
You
blind
dumbos,
all
I
got
is
dick
for
you
to
crumble
on
So
stop
the
show,
but
I
need
a
drum
roll
for
I
go
on
Better
back
away
from
the
front
row,
get
gone
Bigger
then
Dikembe
Mutumbo
I'm
the
fucking
jungle
tron
I'm
a
juggernaut,
you
do
not
wanna
crumble,
you
bambacluts
I'll
leave
you
stretched
out,
like
a
fucking
yard
So
mow
the
fucking
lawn,
your
asses
are
blades
of
grass
And
I'm
fucking
up
this
whole
landscape
of
rap
The
GOAT
just
ate
eight
acres,
and
ate
the
vet
Who
just
make
a
path
and
take
you
straight
to
your
favorite
rapper
Oh
look,
my
notebook
with
smoke
cook
Like
the
flow
stood
a
foot
over
the
flame
on
the
stove,
soot
Like
oak
wood
was
burning
Return
of
the
no
good
I
can
feel
the
heat
risin'
Everything
is
on
fire
Today
is
a
painful
reminder
Of
why
we
can
only
get
brighter
The
further
you
put
it
behind
ya
But
right
now
I'm
on
the
inside
Lookin'
out,
cause...
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It's
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It's
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
Yesterday
was
the
tornado
warning
Today's
like
the
morning
after:
your
world
is
torn
in
half
You
wake
in
its
wake
to
start
the
mourning
process
And
rebuilding,
you're
still
a
work
in
progress
Today's
a
whole
new
chapter
It's
like
an
enormous
asthma
Thunderstorm
has
passed
ya
You
weathered
it
and
poked
its
eye
out
With
the
thorn
bush
that
you
used
to
smell
the
roses
Stopped
to
inhale,
can't
even
tell
your
nose
is
Stuffed,
so
focused
on
the
bright
side
Then
you
floor
the
gas
pedal
And
hit
the
corner
fast,
the
more
asserted
Never
looking
back,
may
hit
the
curb
But
every
day
is
a
new
learning
curve
As
you
steer
through
life
Sometimes
you
might
not
wanna
swerve,
but
you
have
to
To
avert
a
disaster,
lucky
no
permanent
damage
Cause
they
hurt
you
so
bad
It's
like
they
murdered
your
ass
And
threw
dirt
on
your
casket
But
you've
returned
from
the
ashes
And
that
hurt
that
you
have,
you
just
converted
to
gasoline
And
while
you're
burning
the
past
Standing
in
the
inferno
and
chant
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It's
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It's
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
You're
so
familiarized
With
what
having
to
swallow
this
pill
is
like
It
happens
all
the
time,
they
take
your
heart
and
steal
your
life
And
it's
as
though
you
feel
you've
died
Cause
you've
been
killed
inside
But
yet
you're
still
alive,
which
means
you
will
survive
Although
today
you
may
weep,
cause
you're
weakened
And
everything
seems
so
bleak
and
Hopeless,
the
light
that
you're
seekin'
It
begins
to
seep
in;
that's
the
only
thing
keepin'
You
from
leapin'
off
the
mothafreakin'
deep
end
And
I'm
pullin'
for
you
to
push
through
this
feeling
And
with
a
little
time
that
should
do
the
healing
And
by
tomorrow
you
may
even
feel
so
good
That
you're
willing
to
forgive
'em
Even
after
all
the
shit
you
been
put
through,
this
feeling
Of
resilience
is
building,
and
the
flames
are
burning
Quick
as
fire
would
through
this
building
You're
sealed
in,
but
you're
fireproof
Flame
retardant,
you
withstood
it
And
as
you
climb
up
to
the
roof,
you're
just
chillin'
You
look
down,
cause
you're
so
over
'em
You
could
put
the
heel
of
your
foot
through
the
ceiling
As
time
passes,
things
change
every
day
But
wounds,
wounds
heal
But
scars
still
remain
the
same
But
tomorrow,
today's
going
down
in
flames
Throw
the
match,
set
the
past
ablaze
So
feel
the
fire
beneath
your
feet
As
you
barely
even
perspire
from
the
heat
Exhale
deep
and
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
And
as
you
say
goodbye
to
the
grief
It's
like
watching
the
walls
melt
in
your
prison
cell
But
you've
extinguished
this
livin'
hell
Still
a
little
piece
of
you
dies
as
you
scream
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It's
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It's
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I
feel
the
burn,
watch
the
smoke
as
I
turn
Rising,
a
phoenix
from
the
flames
I
have
learned
from
fighting
fights
that
weren't
mine
Not
with
fists,
but
with
wings
that
I
will
fly
And
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It's
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light
I'm
standin'
in
the
flames
It's
a
beautiful
kind
of
pain
Settin'
fire
to
yesterday
Find
the
light,
find
the
light,
find
the
light

I'm
getting
by
with
my
wicked
ways
I'm
loading
up
and
I'm
taking
names
I
want
to
dig
my
way
to
hell
I
want
to
dig
my
way
to
hell
[Verse
1]
Guess
I
got
a
way
with
words
I
could
get
away
with
murder
Ever
heard
of
Aspergers?
It's
a
rare
condition
It's
what
you're
suffering
from
when
you
simply
don't
care
if
its
an
80
degree
day
and
theres
no
fricken
air
conditioning
And
you
can't
see
the
big
terrace
risen
'Cus
you
got
the
windows
up
blaring
the
system
in
your
chevrolet
prism
The
devil
ain't
on
the
level
same
as
him
Just
someone
who
rebels
in
straight
masochism
And
imagine
him
giving
him
an
adjective
an
ass
whooping
so
bad
they
should
put
his
ass
in
prison
I
word
bully
I
verbally
abuse
verbs
like
he
did
something
to
me
personally
Used
forgetfully
so
I
cut
class
and
ditch
it
now
I
fully
rap
Caddilac
from
a
K
Car,
My
ass
from
a
hole
in
a
ground,
still
can't
tell
a
[?]
Came
straight
out
the
trailer
park
screaming
I'm
proud
To
shop
at
k-mart
and
it
became
art
And
I'm
still
fed
up
and
as
pissed
off
as
they
are
To
this
day
I
still
get
in
fights
with
the
same
broad
At
the
same
Walmart
arguing
over
the
same
cart
In
the
middle
of
the
aisle
whilin
I
don't
give
a
fuck
I
don't
play!
You
think
you
saw
this
basket
first?
Yeah
backwards
like
motherfucking
Bob
and
Silent
Jay
Illest
shit
you
could
think
I
would
say
Mind's
like
a
pile
of
clay
When's
the
last
time
you
saw
a
villain
with
a
cape?
Put
a
gaping
hole
in
it
[?]
Tied
him
around
my
neck
went
down
the
fire
escape
of
the
Empire
State
Straight
fell
straight
down
to
the
ground
splattered
all
over
the
entire
state
And
straight
to
hell
got
an
impaled
by
the
gates
So
Satan
stuck
his
face
in
an
ashtray
But
I
sacheted
around
flames
with
a
match
and
I
gave
him
the
gas
face
[?]
And
this
got
nothing
to
do
with
a
scalar
[?]
By
the
way
thoughts
are
getting
darker
by
the
day
I'm
a
combination
of
Skylar
Grey,
Tyler
the
Creator,
and
Violent
Jay
It's
a
fucking
miracle
to
be
this
lyrical
Paint
my
face
with
clown
make
up
and
a
smiley
face
I'm
insane
Every
rhyme
I
say
[?]
like
an
ultra
violet
ray
I'm
sellin
hatred
buffet
style
all
the
shit
you
can
eat
$11.99
so
come
on
and
pile
a
plate
I'm
throwin'
down
the
gauntlet
to
see
what
hell
I
can
raise
With
the
rhyme
I'm
spittin
while
I'm
shittin'
on
the
competition
In
the
meantime
it's
always
mean
time

[Verse
2]
I've
been
a
career
asshole
I
don't
see
why
these
people
always
got
my
back
I
done
said
so
much
fucked
up
shit,
I
was
born
a
mistake
But
I
was
put
here
not
by
accident
I
had
a
purpose
and
that
purpose
was
to
beat
a
beat
purplish
Slaughter
tracks,
I
done
put
my
two
dimes
and
a
nickel
in
this
shit
And
I'm
coming
to
get
that
quarter
back
[?]
the
drama
can
build
Your
mama
can
ask
me
for
my
autograph
That
cougars
a
MILF,
she's
the
oldest
trick
in
the
book
But
I
sure
would
fall
for
that
You
done
brought
a
bat
to
a
rocket
launcher
fight
When
I
get
on
the
mic
I'm
a
snap
Make
you
wish
the
ambulance
that
took
me
to
the
hospital
when
I
overdosed
would
have
caught
a
flat
If
it
makes
you
sick
to
your
stomach
pass
it
Indigestion
my
suggestions
[?]
If
it
feels
like
I'm
running
away
with
the
game
Its
'cus
I
am
don't
speculate
spectate
All
I
got
is
??
days
and
insults
for
decades
But
I
get
by
my
wicked
ways
lady
you
can
suck
a
dick
till
your
neck
aches
Cry
till
you
get
puffed
eyes
red
face
But
I'm
leaving
on
this
jet
plane
????
I'm
sick
of
pounding
a
squarepagan
around
all
??
of
the
catchrays
But
your
baggage
ain't
gonna
fit
in
my
storage
over
headspace
Cuz
you
just
ain't
big
enough
to
fit
your
damage
???
Other
words
don't
try
to
put
the
heart
in
a
headcase
Cuz
baby
stable
mentally
I
ain't
I
need
my
meds
I
peed
my
bed
I'm
going
blind
I
don't
see
my
legs
I
keep
on
falling
down
No
wonder
you
can't
stand
me
I
need
my
cane
Someone
help
me
I
think
my
face
is
melting
You
???my
grains
these
maggot
in
my
brain
This
G-I-A-N-T
hole
in
my
empty
head
If
you
read
my
mind
you
can
see
my
pain
And
you'd
see
why
I'd
be
this
way
Ever
since
I
was
???playin'
with
??
Or
shut
the
P-I-E
hoes
that
peep
my
game
Used
to
get
bent,
now
I
represent
to
the
fullest
Pencil
is
full
of
insolent
bullets
I'm
like
a
Doberman
Pinscher,
Pitbull
and
a
Rott'
Mixed
with
a
toxic,
the
plot
begins
to
thicken
I
begin
to
spittin',
like
vintage
Pac
Demented,
demonic,
sinister
Ever
since
the
the
Doc
replenished
me
The
day
he
gave
me
that
shot
when
I
was
just
'bout
to
quit
So
to
not
see
him
with
me
would
be
a
shocking
image
And
I'm
the
definition
of
what
a
concrete
chin
is
Cause
no
matter
how
many
times
you
sock
me
in
it
And
knock
me
to
the
canvas
Even
the
boxing
critics
know
that
if
I
get
off
to
a
rocky
start,
I'll
always
have
a
Rocky
finish
Eat
me
brocoli,
spinach,
cocky?
Nope
But
I
hope
I
offended
you
when
I
told
ya
how
dope
I
am
at
this
and
put
emphasis
on
the
"dope"
So
when
names
come
up,
in
that
conversation
of
who's
the
dopest,
better
throw
mine
in
it
And
don't
mind
me,
while
I
remind
you
of
the
flow
You
won't
find
anywhere,
when
it
fires
and
I
unload
My
pen
explodes
'til
there's
no
rhymes
in
it
Reload
in
no
time,
let
insults
fly
every
60
seconds
that
go
by
So
you
know
I
meant
it
In
school
I
was
so
shy,
timid
Two
pairs
of
jeans
I'd
alternate,
bummy
clothes,
I
'member
Begging
my
mom
for
K-Mart
McGregors
Cause
they
were
new,
St.
Vincent
de
Paul
Those
Pony's
were
used,
and
no
size
fitted
But
kissed
them
old
days,
adiós,
I
did
it
They
said
I
was
a
gimmick
Now
I'm
the
one
that
those
guys
mimic
Now
you
fuckers
don't
wanna
go
starting
no
argument
Cause
you
know
I'll
win
it
Name
a
flow
that's
more
authentic,
and
don't
front
You
know
I
got
you
open,
kid,
don't
front
You
know
I
got
you
open,
word,
don't
front
You
know
I
got
you
open,
kid,
yo
why
you
frontin'?
You
know
I
got
you
open,
kid
Rest
in
peace
to
Big
Proof
You
was
a
beast,
you
lyrically
mirrored
me
Molded
my
flow
off
of
you,
your
spirit's
flowing
through
me
I
love
you,
Doody,
without
you
I
feel
so
incomplete
I'm
no
king,
no
need
for
rose
petals
to
be
thrown
at
my
feet
I'm
a
thorn
in
your
side,
get
thrown
into
a
throne
Better
watch
the
fucking
tone
that
you
speak
Feel
like
I'm
in
the
zone,
I'm
in
a
whole
different
league
On
my
mothafuckin'
own,
it's
just
me
No
opponents
can
compete
And
I've
never
been
known
to
retreat
From
beef,
be
beat,
follow
trends
or
wallow
in
defeat
I'm
still
hungry
as
fuck,
but
can't
even
say
"Bon
appétit!"
Cause
I
don't
know
what
to
eat
Fucking
microphone
or
the
beat
Bitch,
nobody's
mind
works
like
mine
It's
nose
to
the
grindstone
time,
holmes,
your
mind's
blown
Cause
I
rhyme
like
I'm
still
trying
to
get
signed
Up
in
the
Ebony
Show-case
With
Denaun
screamin'
"Who
the
fuck
passed
you
the
mic?"
Never
asked
you
like
my
shit
from
the
get
I'd
rather
ask
you
to
wipe
my
ass,
bitch
You
had
you
a
nice
run,
now
take
a
hike
I
ever
meet
my
match,
I'ma
strike
that
bitch
first
Cause
on
the
mic
I
gotta
represent
the
real
rappers
The
real
rappers
get
their
mothafuckin'
skills
crackin'
Word
to
Buckshot
and
Dru-Ha,
why
the
fuck
not?
You
don't
like
it?
Suck
a
cock!
Almost
forgot,
before
I
signed
with
the
Doc
I
almost
signed
with
Duck
Down
Cause
Rawkus
didn't
make
no
offers,
so
mothafuck
Loud
They
jerked
me
around,
so
what's
up
now?
Wow,
how
much
of
an
asshole
would
I
sound
like
Rubbing
it
in
and
holding
some
grudge
now?
But
don't
front
You
know
I
got
you
open,
kid,
don't
front
You
know
I
got
you
open,
word,
don't
front
You
know
I
got
you
open,
kid,
yo
why
you
frontin'?
You
know
I
got
you
open,
kid
Late
at
night,
used
to
catch
a
buzz,
couldn't
write
Now
I
write
the
type
of
shit
to
make
you
wipe
But
wear
diapers,
cause
you
might
leave
a
streak
I'm
on
a
streak
windshield
wipers
couldn't
wipe
It's
hard
to
decipher
what
cypher
I
might
jump
into
tonight
Cause
I'm
hyper
or
something
Needing
someone
or
something
is
lighting
This
fire
under
me,
it's
breathing
new
life
It's
like
I
already
died
once
I
guess
some
people
only
live
twice,
and
it's
funny
My
days
of
being
broke
were
so
long
ago
I
lost
all
concept
of
money
But
you
dimes
won't
get
a
fucking
nickle
from
me
Oh
shit,
I'm
down
on
one
knee
I'm
having
a
stroke
of
genius
Elizabeth,
I'm
coming
to
you,
honey
From
boy
to
man
And
still
make
a
whore
moan,
like
a
thyroid
gland
I'm
in
another
category,
man
Don't
put
me
up
with
them
pop
stars
I
never
needed
a
pat
on
the
back
to
get
at
a
boy,
band
No
offense?
Yes
offense
Precedents
has
been
set
that'll
never
get
met
Middle
finger
pressed
against
Moby's
nose
Shouts
to
Obie,
the
curtains
closed
on
my
show
But
never
forget
that
I'm
the
one
you
thought
wouldn't
make
it
You
can't
take
it,
oh
Got
a
whole
generation
of
rappers
coming
up
That
are
nutty
with
the
flow
But
convince
me
you've
heard
An
MC
since
me
who's
as
good
With
the
fucking
mincing
of
words,
without
mincing
words
that'll
make
you
feel
like
I'm
pinching
a
nerve
Who's
mentally
disturbed
You
might
as
well
stick
a
knife
in
me
and
turn
It'll
be
like
my
skin
being
Indian
burned
Hah,
bitch,
there
isn't
one,
when
will
you
learn?
Never
been
served,
if
memory
serves,
I'd
battle
that
'til
my
own
recollection
remembers
these
words
You
know
I
got
you
open
kid,
stop
frontin'
You
know
I
got
you
open,
Word
Life
I'm
liable
to
start
a
violent
spark
with
a
silent
thought
I
disgust
you
like
dialogue
from
the
shop
to
The
Wired
Frog
Night
club,
shit,
I
was
taught
if
you
see
these
on
fire
You
had
to
put
it
out
yourself
like
Highland
Park,
no
fire
department
So
you
may
not
hear
sirens
at
all
But
don't
be
alarmed
if
I
sound
off
Something
just
ain't
right
with
me,
dawg
A
martyr
on
a
private
charter,
whose
life
could
be
harder
Widely
regarded,
highly
bite
me,
sweetheart,
I'm
slightly
retarded
But
tonight
I'm
starting
shit,
I'm
feeling
self
righteous
I
might
just
hop
in
a
mosh
pit
on
some
Mike
Tyson
and
Pac
shit
Looking
to
box
with
anybody,
disorderly
conduct
I'll
fuck
around
and
snort
a
key
and
pick
a
fight
with
a
locksmith
Fan
of
the
LOX,
bananas,
manic,
I'm
going
in
shock
Frantic,
I'm
trapped
in
a
closet
Panic
attack
cause
I'm
claustrophobic
No,
faggot,
I
mean
I
can't
maneuver
from
movement
Cause
I
had
no
room
for
improvement
I'm
practically
squashed,
unpacked
it
and
boxed
it
Toxic,
hands
are
arsenic,
flammable
bars,
examine
the
content
Bar
exam,
start
of
insanity
Charles
Hamilton
slash
Manson
and
Bronson
Animal
snarls,
cannibal
jaws
Shark
mandibles,
lambs
that'll
slaughter
Looking
skamp
as
Hannibal
stocking
Anthony
Hopkins
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
Black
out,
Zach
Galifianakis,
gallons
of
Vodka
But
I
gallon
some
knockers
I
bet
you
they
ring
a
bell
when
I
come
back
and
I'm
conscious
What
happened,
doc?
I
passed
out
again
Alcohol's
making
me
break
into
vacant's
naked
Stole
a
Magnum
box
and
bag
Cirocs
in
back
of
a
Doxon
Fell
asleep
watching
Fear
Factor
and
Scare
Tactics
Too
close
to
the
stair
master
Poked
a
hole
in
the
air
mattress
and
popped
it
Woke
up
shortly
there
after,
hungover
No
one
to
wear,
grasping
a
bear,
rasped
it
and
dropped
it
Air
Max
in
my
closet,
preposterous
Nikes
made
out
of
ostrich
And
the
cross
stitching
is
a
cross
mix
Of
a
rhinoceros,
possum
skin,
giraffe
and
a
dolphin
Dolphin
fin
dockers,
eyes
cautious,
drop
crotches
Swats
watches
and
sneakers
matches
with
the
parkers
But
it's
like
being
overstepped
at
a
boxing
gym
With
all
these
trainers,
but
I
don't
have
any
boxers
And
I'm
standing
here
naked,
hangover,
still
wasted
Like
paper
you
write
raps
on,
obnoxious
Yo,
why
does
it
always
sound
like
I'm
grabbing
my
nostrils?
Fuck
that,
I'll
battle
'em
all,
I'll
battle
'em
all
I'll
stand
there
and
yell
mad
at
a
wall
Until
the
mannequin
doll
scatter
the
inanimate
objects
That
I'm
badder
than
all,
shatter
and
fall
Cause
I
hear
the
track
And
I'm
starting
to
get
fucking
amped,
I'mma
spark
with
'em
Like
the
car
with
the
cables
hooked
to
my
fucking
back,
I'm
a
Duracell
But
I
sure
as
hell
got
it
backwards
cause
y'all
could
get
jumped
And
I'd
catch
the
battery
charge,
but
I
got
a
hunch
like
your
back
when
it's
arching
When
I
start
attacking
your
squadron
You'll
feel
like
Master
Card
when
I'm
charging
So
take
a
swipe
at
me,
I'm
coming
straight
at
you
Like
Clay
Matthews
from
the
Green
Bay
Packers
So
get
the
sack
of
Wisconsin
That's
nutbag
that
I'm
talking,
who
am
I
kidding?
You
faggots
are
all
gonna
do
my
bidding
Don't
get
dragged
to
the
auction
Neiman
Marcus,
bags
of
the
Tylenol
I'll
push
a
bitch
into
oncoming
traffic,
just
watch
this
Stretched,
tinted,
black
sedan
my
ass
See
I'm
at
you
wack
when
I
drop
you
off
at
Saks
Fifth
Ave
In
a
fucking
taxi
cab
to
go
shopping
Affable
guy
next
door
is
laughable
My
next
whore's
gon'
have
mechanical
arms
That'll
jack
me
off
with
a
lotion
dispenser
with
a
motion
sensor
No
emotion
hence
I
guess
this
sick
prick
dies
hard
I
got
a
Magic
Johnson
It's
like
a
magic
wand
allows
me
to
not
let
a
blonde
arouse
me
If
Ronda
Rousey
was
on
the
couch,
with
the
condoms
out
Holding
a
thousand
Magnums
at
once,
Wants
to
Pounce
How
I
laugh
in
response
how
she
dances
and
flaunts
it
around
me
Her
flat
little
badonkadonk
is
bouncing
around
And
all
I
see
is
Paulie
Malign
now,
she's
slaughterhouse
in
a
blouse
And
Madonna
with
mud
on
her,
got
dammit
I
a
misogynist
I
slap
Lindar
Ronstadt,
throw
her
off
a
balcony
Just
so
happens
she's
fond
of
Al
Cause
now
she's
faceplanting
on
the
concrete
Complete
lack
of
responsibility
Half
you
assholes
ain't
strong
enough
to
pick
up
a
spirit
Shit,
you
faggots
couldn't
shoplift
at
a
thrift
shop
But
I
let
the
track
lift
'em
up,
boost
the
energy
Klepto,
I'm
back
to
rip
shop
up,
but
my
thing
is
this
now
Five
finger
discount
Been
rapping
so
long
I've
been
killing
this
shit,
it's
easy
Kidnapping
your
mom
cause
I'm
still
in
this
bitch,
thievery
Ransom
for
JonBenét
Ramsey,
Chandra
Levy,
and
Gary
Condit
Always
scared
if
I
went
back
to
the
blonde
I
might
relapse,
get
to
some
bullshit
Perhaps
I'll
launch
some
cracker
taunts
at
Action
Bronson
Macklemore
and
Mac
Miller
and
Asher
Roth
Have
some
back
and
forths
And
record
a
wack
response
to
Kendrick
Lamar's
Control
verse
And
perform
Fack
in
concert
"Hey
go,
hey
go!"
Yo,
I
put
that
shit
on
a
Greatest
Hits
album
Now
that
was
awesome
It
takes
some
massive
balls
to
do
some
shit
like
that
Sometimes
I
have
to
ponder
why
people
are
like
(I'll
stick
around)
And
put
up
with
my
crap
so
long
for
What's
the
attraction,
mama?
Is
it
the
fact
that
I'm
a
walking,
talking,
actual
quadruple
entendre
Or
the
pointy
nose
that's
pointing
at
you,
mama?
Who
knows
at
this
point,
it's
always
poking
so
meh
Still
get
along
with
this
voice
cause
that's
the
monster
So
do-si-do
with
a
sociopath,
everyone
who
knows
me
knows
that
What
they
don't
know
is
the
fact
Rihanna
calls
me
Pinocchio,
meh
She
loves
the
way
I
lie
Sits
on
my
face
and
waits
for
my
nose
to
grow
Pathological
liar,
oh,
why
am
I
such
an
asshole
That
might've
disguise
pants,
but
they
on
fire
So
am
I-a,
wooh,
Cappadonna,
cut
the
track
off
Sabotage
Christmas,
crap
in
your
stocking
I'm
wrapping
up
all
the
presents
In
fucking
camouflage
so
you
can't
even
find
'em
Jack
Santa
Claus,
snap
Rudolph's
antlers
off
Wrap
his
schnoz
in
gauze
bandage
and
blind
him
Blowing
the
head
gasket
at
Bed,
Bath
and
Beyond
Put
the
basket
back
while
the
bath
salt
packets
are
gone
Know
you
really
tired
of
me
sampling
Billy
Squier
But
classic
rock
acid
rap
is
the
genre
Got
Slash
on
guitar,
splashing
Bizarre,
Trasher
and
Aerosmith
And
I'm
a
spectacular
archer,
feed
count
Dracula
Chocula
Godzilla,
half
dragon
and
Bob
Dylan
Bandwagoners
kicking
the
damn
stragglers
off
and
I'm
strangling
'em
Smack
Kim
Basinger
on
the
ass
I
guess
you
could
consider
it
poetry,
but
with
me
it
started
out
with
just
words,
just
words.
They
started
looking
like
puzzle
pieces
so
I
started
connecting
them
to
each
other
'til
they
started
to
resemble
blank
canvases.
By
this
time
I
was
an
artist
so
I
just
started
to
see
these
pictures,
these
real
visuals,
psychopathical
killer
(I'm
a
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer
I'm
a
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer
A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer
A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
Feelin'
it
in
the
air,
breathe
it
in
the
night
Sayin'
I'm
a
killer
Did
you
ever
think
we
would
come
to
find?
Maybe
in
my
dreams
I'm
a
psychopath,
I'm
never
keepin'
it
plain
Lyrical
murder
is
somethin'
I've
been
about
Ever
since
I
was
a
little
kid,
doodlin'
in
the
class
Drew
a
picture
of
my
teacher,
bullet
in
his
head,
ruler
in
his
ass
With
a
toilet
in
front
of
him,
throwin'
up,
pissed
off
Prolly
symbolic
of
this
thought,
sick
tot
To
my
inner
enemy
in
a
rush
I'm
havin'
nightmares
of
leavin'
behind
my
dreams
With
anything
less
than
a
full
bank
It's
like
I'm
General
Hong,
and
I'm
standin'
in
front
of
a
gun
I'm
puttin'
myself
in
the
way
of
a
bullet
to
pull
rank
The
hood
is
over
my
eyes
but
the
wool
ain't
Yeah,
got
the
mentality
of
bein'
with
a
wizard
Every
award
show,
we
don't
even
get
considered
How
do
you
sell
somethin'
that's
so
lyrical
To
a
kid
that
wouldn't
know
what
was
hittin'
if
it
hit
him?
Now
I
wanna
talk
about
these
niggas
from
Detroit
Beef
on
me
and
Shady
who
was
thinkin'
'bout
Detroit
We
put
the
world
onto
it
so
watch
how
you
say
"fuck
me"
You
just
might
jinx
yourself,
whoop,
your
girl
gon'
do
it
Cause
I
was
in
that
911
in
Chicago,
911
at
the
same
time
I
had
already
been
grindin'
since
'97,
that's
longevity
And
if
you
think
you're
lyrically
better,
you
better
be
a
killer
(I'm
a
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
You
ain't
ever
see
a
mothafucka
get
realer
(A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
Goin'
automatic
on
anybody
sporadic
I
choose
(A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
Cause
ain't
nobody
iller
Knowing
nobody
for
realer
(A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
It's
an
elite
drinker,
mister
ringleader
I'm
a
deep
thinker,
I'm
a
street
preacher
With
a
street
sweeper
full
of
heat
seekers
In
your
Jeep
speakers
I'mma
keep
ringers
I
don't
need
heaters,
I
got
the
meat
cleaver
Welcome
to
the
slaughterhouse
Niggas
try
to
tell
me
I
spell
too
much
Capital
S
to
the
laugh
to
the
T-E-R
Ho,
U-S-E,
now
go
to
hell
you
fucks,
word
Making
work
disappear
quick
as
magic
Abracadabra,
the
traffic
blacker
than
Africa
Can
you
imagine
a
nigga
flipping
bread
for
the
blood?
Money
like
Dracula,
hand
him
some
spatula,
ask
me
a
question
Am
I
the
best
with
the
flexing?
Fuck
yes
with
the
goon
talk
I
just
moonwalk
all
over
the
beat
then
I'm
lightin'
up
the
street
CROOKED
going
Michael
Jackson
on
Thriller
I'm
a
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer
(I'm
a
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
You
ain't
ever
see
a
mothafucka
get
realer
(A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
Goin'
automatic
on
anybody
sporadic
I
choose
(A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
Cause
ain't
nobody
iller
Knowing
nobody
for
realer
(A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
Feelin'
it
in
the
air,
breathe
it
in
the
night
Sayin'
I'm
a
killer
Did
you
ever
think
we
would
come
to
find?
Maybe
in
my
dreams
The
thought
of
retiring
Is
makin'
me
want
to
set
your
daughter
on
fire
with
a
soldering
iron
What
up
mom,
applyin'
for
the
rim
job,
are
you
hirin'?
I'm
hopin'
to
fill
up
your
opening
Oh
but
I
know
I
gotta
meet
a
lot
of
requirements
First
I
gotta
accept
you
in
the
lobby
and
the
isle
and
You've
probably
already
been
with
all
the
slaughter
and
iron
men
No
mood
to
be
playin'
second
fiddle,
slob
on
this
violin
With
no
strings
attached
I'm
just
the
product
of
a
hostile
environment
But
bein'
brought
up
so
brought
up
inspired
But
I
don't
know
why,
it's
still
like
I'm
caught
up
inside
a
whirlpool
Not
an
appliance,
but
applyin'
this
science,
I
psychotically
rhyme
And
it's
like
stars
have
aligned
all
in
alliance
Heart
of
a
lion,
balls
of
Goliath
Obscene
talkin',
the
twine
like
a
bean's
talkin'
and
buyin'
But
I
keep
walkin'
the
line
between
the
wrong
and
the
right
But
everything
I
write
seems
wrong
and
it's
like
I'm
ecstatic
at
all
the
static
that
I
can
still
cause
In
the
fabric
of
our
modern
society
Now
Catholics
are
panicking
cause
I
snapped
back
to
my
old
antics
and
shenanigans
Dammit
the
pope's
mad
again
Probably
shouldn't
have
ran
up
in
the
Vatican
with
that
mannequin
Singin'
"Bagpipes
from
Baghdad"
again
In
my
dad's
drag
draggin'
a
faggot
in,
a
glad
bag
Won't
be
the
last
time
I
make
a
dramatic
entrance,
like
that
again
You
thought
I
was
lyin'
when
I
said
I
think
that
I'm
crossin'
the
line
again?
I've
lost
my
mind,
caution
oh
God
I
think
I've
thought
of
another
fucking
line
Forgive
me
father,
for
I
have
sinned
But
hip
hop
has
left
me
brainwashed
with
a
violent
streak
Defiant,
now
the
odds
of
me
tryin'
to
fuckin'
be
quiet
Probably
gotta
be
'bout
as
high
as
the
Jolly
Green
Giant
After
he's
fallen
in
pollen
next
to
a
killer
bee
hive
colony
tryin'
to
sneak
by
it
So
please
don't
follow
me
while
I
revive
rap
I'ma
start
up
a
rioting,
try
to
stop
it
or
silence
it
You're
not
gonna,
might
as
well
just
hit
the
block
in
your
joggin'
attire
in
Boston,
across
the
marathon
finish
line
and
I
Put
your
thoughts
against
mine
Cause
the
arsenal
I
have'll
scar
you
for
life,
worse
than
Dzhokhar
And
I
have
a
bomb,
pliers
and
barbed
wire
Your
bars
are
like
Barney
Fife
with
a
fucking
swiss
army
knife
A
saber
that's
Darth
Vader
with
arthritis
at
a
bar
fight
With
the
Dark
Knight
on
a
dark
night
with
his
arms
tied
up
I'm
Dahmer-like
when
I'm
on
the
mic,
I'm
not
gonna
lie
Perform
like
I'm
gonna
die
at
the
end
of
a
song
so
it's
hard
for
the
rhyme
to
end
Like
fuck
'em
all
and
just
ride
Like
I'm
locked
up
inside
a
shot
of
Bonnie
and
Clyde
called
Uncle
Ronnie
is
driving,
'bout
to
burst
in
through
the
side
door
Fuck
up
an
asylum
and
park
in
the
dining
room
(I'm
a
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
You
ain't
ever
see
a
mothafucka
get
realer
(A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
Goin'
automatic
on
anybody
sporadic
I
choose
(A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
Cause
ain't
nobody
iller
Knowing
nobody
for
realer
(A
psychopath,
I'm
a
killer)
I
roll
over
and
go
to
reach
for
you,
you're
gone
This
bed's
empty
without
you
You
said
you're
moving
on
But
I'm
having
some
trouble
getting
there
But
dwelling
ain't
getting
me,
uhh,
anywhere
Fuckin'
Valentine's
Day
Fuck
February,
stuffed
teddy
bear,
guts
everywhere
Machete
on
the
floor
I
smashed
up
everywhere
Yeah,
how
do
I
look?
You
fuckin'
just
let
me
here
to
die
didn't
you?
Why
didn't
you
respond
yet?
I've
written
you
five
or
six
different
times
and
I'm
gettin'
sick
and
tired
of
always
apologizing
to
you
I
didn't
do
shit
to
deserve
what
you're
puttin'
me
through
This
couldn't
be
true,
we
can't
be
over
So
violets
are
blue,
roses
are
red
Why
is
it
everything
I
do
I'm
reminded
of
you?
Saw
two
white
coffins
in
my
dreams
last
night
I
saw
my
Lord
Jesus
with
his
hands
pointing
toward
the
light
Saw
my
old
sweetheart
she
said,
"honey,
I'm
back"
Just
so
you
don't
die
alone,
just
so
you
don't
die
alone
Guess
I
gotta
deal
with
the
fact
that,
you
ain't
never
comin'
back
Now
every
woman
that
I
look
at
I'm
lookin'
for
you
So
I'm
findin'
something
the
matter
with
them
Excuse
to
not
see
anyone
Useless,
rather
pick
up
the
phone,
not
at
all,
followin'
protocol
I
get
bowled
like
bowling
balls
No
calls
and
know
to
call
to
talk,
forget
what
I
want
to
say
Damnit
I'm
drawin'
blanks
like
I'm
playin'
hangman
I'm
sick
of
playin'
these
games,
I
can't
handle
this
heartbreak
It's
makin'
me
wanna
blow
out
my
brains
Like
birthday
cake
candles
Hang
up
the
phone
and
I
shake,
I
think
I
may
have
made
a
mistake
Can't
escape
the
madness
Turn
the
radio
on,
I
hate
this
sad
song
But
I
can't
even
change
the
station
The
same
one's
playin'
on
eight
channels
I
lay
awake
in
shambles
I'm
startin
to
hallucinate
And
I'm
havin'
all
these
visions
of
us
at
each
other's
wakes
In
caskets
and
suddenly
I
wake
and
that's
when
I
know
I
Saw
two
white
coffins
in
my
dreams
last
night
I
saw
my
Lord
Jesus
with
his
hands
pointing
toward
the
light
Saw
my
old
sweetheart
she
said,
"honey,
I'm
back"
Just
so
you
don't
die
alone,
just
so
you
don't
die
alone
Give
me
one
more,
bottle
for
the
pain
Give
me
one
more
for
the
memories
Give
me
one
more,
I'll
make
it
taste
like
a
steak
It'll
help
alleviate
It'll
soothe
this
ache
Of
trying
to
fake
That
she's
really,
she's
really
coming
back
And
it's
been
a
while
now,
but
I
finally
realize
how
Much
reality
sucks,
but
it's
just
something
about
our
love
I'm
still
with
in
denial
now,
dealing
with
the
finality
of
it
And
it's
making
me
crazy
thinking
of
the
days
we,
spent
And
how
I'll
never
hold
you
again
And
there
ain't
shit
I
can
do
about
it
Now
my
head
is
overcrowded
With
these
tired
memories
and
I
can't
seem
to
get
you
out
it
And
how
the
fuck
do
you
sleep
comfortably
Knowing
what
you
done
did
to
me,
huh?
Did
it
even
occur
to
you
that
I
loved
you,
huh?
Complete,
madly,
head
over
heels
for
you
Was
you
and
me,
wants
us
to
be
together
forever
It
was
supposed
to
be
us,
but
you
crushed
the
dream
We
was
supposed
to
die
together,
and
it's
killing
me
so
much
When
I
sleep
I
wake
up
dead,
must
be
why
I
Saw
two
white
coffins
in
my
dreams
last
night
I
saw
my
Lord
Jesus
with
his
hands
pointing
toward
the
light
Saw
my
old
sweetheart
she
said,
"honey,
I'm
back"
Just
so
you
don't
die
alone,
just
so
you
don't
die
alone
Got
a
shitty
grin,
bitch
show
me
them
itty-bitty
titties
again
We're
in
Sin
City,
since
when
did
we
begin
to
get
addicted
to
dope
Diggity,
bitch,
you
need
to
run
and
go
get
your
friggidy-friends
I'm
looking
at
your
bum-stickdy-bum
hun
The
migidy
mac's,
bigidy
back
Don't
act
wigidy-wack,
you
can
get
the
fididy-finger,
the
middle
You
little
busy
bitch,
stick-stickity
in
Got
a
6
o'
clock
craving,
stop
get
Ciroc
It's
about
to
be
an
unbelievable
night
I
call
it
surreal,
Sir
Mix
a
Lot
tape
in
Hit
the
spot,
spot
my
next
victim
I'm
picky
like
I
missed
a
spot
shaving
Came
to
sip
vodka,
shit
yeah,
that
little
chick
is
hot
but
if
she
got
rabies
I
wouldn't
give
the
bitch
a
shot,
I
poke
her
in
the
rear
But
I
bet
if
I
lick
her,
she'll
try
to
chase
me
(Haha)
What
are
you
pit,
rott,
mixed
or
you
just
got
fixed
well
shit
then
let's
lip-lock
If
not
then
trick
piss
off
you
snobby
little
pig
snot
nose
You
think
you're
hot
shit
cause
you're
in
heat
Well,
bitch,
if
you're
solar
Then
I'm
your
polar
opposite
dog
cause
I'm
colder
than
popsicle
sticks,
poppin'
shit
Talkin'
it,
walkin'
it,
spit
rocks
Then
my
sick
thoughts
are
about
to
lick
shots
Like
this
shit's
hopping,
and
drip-dropping
in
chocolate-ly
whip-topping
So
whether
you're
Hip
Hop,
Slipknot,
Big,
Pac
Kid
Rock,
Kris
Kross,
Rick
Ross,
you'll
dig
this
If
not
then
kick
rocks
in
flip
flops
And
I
produced
the
track
So
you
don't
have
to
ask
who
it
is
when
this
shit
knocks
(TURN
UP!)
So
bring
clairvoyance
to
this
bangin
and
I'mma
keep
on
saying
All
the
shit
I
should
be
hung
for,
and
probably
killed
for
saying
And
I
probably
will,
but
not
until
the
day
I
pop
a
pill
again
Like
chopping
'til
I'm
dropping,
still
if
that
don't
do
the
job
of
killing
Shady,
then
the
karma
will,
insane
him
I'm
as
brainy
Mohammad
until
the
Parkinson's
done
eat
away
my
brain
And
made
me
Robin
Williams
crazy
Or
I
end
up
with
dementia,
but
you
rocking
with
a
sadist
Hate
to
say
this,
but
if
the
thought
is
entertaining
I
ain't
stopping
till
be
sprayed
it
Oh
my
god,
for
real
man,
not
again
I'm
shaking
But
before
I
tie
a
rope
around
this
nob
If
they
don't
like
it,
got
a
knob
they
can
slob
on
until
-
Wait
I
just
forgot
what
I
was
thinking...
What's
it
called
again?
I'm
blanking
Something
about
the
balls
between
my
legs
and
I
think
I
can
feel
it
dangling,
it's
throbbing
and
it's
veiny
Wait
I
think
I
got
it,
okay
bitch
I
got
you,
Robin
Williams
hanging
Go
hang
in
the
lobby
unless
you
came
to
slob
me
Come
on
kemosabe
It's
past
time,
like
your
favorite
hobby
Cause
if
the
way
that
I
spit
shit
remains
on
my
dick
then
she
grab
me
by
the
nuts
and
tried
to
take
my
sausage
as
a
hostage
Ain't
it
obvious?
Pretty
much
a
no
brainer,
or
should
I
say
Cobainer?
That
she's
plain
addicted
to
my
dick
like
Lorena
Bobbit
Got
a
wean
her
off
it,
weiner
off
it
like
she
took
my
fucking
penis,
chopped
it,
and
stuck
it
up
between
her
armpits
And
she
begun
to
swing
a
crumpet
knife
and
paint
the
carpet,
at
least
that's
what
her
train
of
thought
is
Cause
I
came,
saw,
conquered,
hit
it,
quit
it,
and
made
up
a
plane
of
bonkers
And
I
always
end
up
giving
these
bitches
some
complex
And
I
don't
mean
apartment
So
spread
your
feet
apart
And
let
me
see
you
do
some
yoga
stretches,
splits
Now
grab
this
Cuisinart
And
make
me
breakfast,
bitch,
that's
a
prerequisite
And
that's
just
to
get
in
this
bedroom,
bitch
Walked
up
to
that
Ke$ha
chick
(what
up?)
Said
my
name
is
Booger,
wanna
catch
a
flick?
I'll
even
let
you
pick,
make
her
fetch
a
stick
Bet
you
if
you
get
this
old
dog
these
new
tricks
To
get
familiar
with
I'll
learn
extra
quick
Kick
a
pregnant
bitch,
oops,
I
guess
the
shit
Took
an
unexpected
twist
like
the
neck
of
the
freaking
exorcist
Bitch,
I
said
that
this
mask
ain't
for
hockey
Hate
Versace,
Versace,
I
got
Münchhausen
by
proxy
I'm
making
you
sick,
don't
pretend
you
can't
hear
me
You
deaf,
girl,
I
said
you
was
foxy
I'll
tell
a
bitch
like
Bizarre
Bitch,
shut
the
fuck
up
and
get
in
my
car
And
suck
my
fucking
dick
while
I
take
a
shit
And
I
think
with
my
dick
so
come
blow
my
mind
And
it
tastes
like
humble
pie
So
swallow
my
pride,
you're
lucky
just
to
follow
my
ride
If
I
let
you
run
alongside
the
Humvee
Unless
you're
Nicki,
grab
you
by
the
wrist,
let's
ski
So
what's
it
gon'
be?
Put
that
shit
away
Iggy
You
gon'
blow
that
rape
whistle
on
me
(Scream!)
I
love
it
'Fore
I
get
lost
with
the
gettin'
off
Like
this
is
our
exit,
now
lets
hit
the
highway
and
try
not
to
get
lost
'Till
we
get
to
Las
Vegas
(Party,
do
it
'till
tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till
we
get
to
Las
Vegas
(Party,
do
it
'till
tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till
we
get
to
Las
Vegas
(Party,
do
it
'till
tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till
we
get
to
Las
Vegas
(Party,
do
it
'till
tomorrow)
Vegas
Whatever
happens
here,
stays
here
So
let's
go
all
the
way
here
Til
we
get
to
Las
Vegas
Whatever
happens
in
my
room,
it
stays
in
my
room
like
movie
night
like
cable
Treat
every
women
in
my
stable
like
flavors
Looking
like
she
kryptonite
and
I
get
weak
after
like
7
days
In
7
nights
in
the
days
and
it's
our
Vegas
We
rolling
circles
and
packs,
we
the
lifesavers
She
got
a
boyfriend,
I
got
a
toy
then
I'll
bring
her
with
me
when
I
show
up
to
her
crib
waving
And
I
ain't
tryna
be
the
nice
neighbor
I'm
so
Jay
Electronic,
I'm
cut
like
I'm
all
out
of
razors
And
all
I
got
is
a
gun
left
with
a
bayonet
on
it
Next
ho
froze
and
it
look
like
I
walked
in
to
a
jewelry
store
With
a
about
a
million
dollars
with
your
mama
And
sat
down
did
an
ALS
challenge,
haaaan
I
stole
that
adlib
from
French,
Bad
&
Evil
back
at
it
again
About
to
get
my
back
tatted
again
About
to
get
a
pic
of
a
backstabber
with
an
axe
in
his
hand
Sitting
on
a
bike
in
the
sand
If
you
ain't
been
through
nothing
Then
that
shouldn't
mean
nothing
to
you
like
legs
on
a
crab
If
she
current
I
keep
her
pussy
purring
like
the
pipes
on
a
lamp
Weed
got
her
so
chinky
eyed
Look
like
she
been
getting
high
on
a
flight
to
Japan
I
keep
my
jewelry
on
while
I'm
fucking
Sound
like
I'm
shaking
up
dice
in
a
can
Listen,
though
this
ain't
Christmas
I
make
you
my
ex
miss
If
this
is
my
passion
I
learn
to
give
those
who
don't
appreciate
my
presence
The
gift
of
my
absence
I
don't
know
who
you
been
listening
to
Got
me
fucked
up
like
Pookie
in
the
chicken
coop
Bitch,
I
don't
give
a
two
shits
Bitch,
get
the
fuck
out
of
my
face
To
make
a
long
story
short,
I
don't
really
gotta
stand
there
And
listen
to
you
while
you
throw
a
silly
tantrum
Even
though
I
have
an
affinity
for
witty
banter
Starting
to
feel
like
foulplay
like
Billy
Laimbeer
Hold
up,
she
misunderstood
me
I
said
saint,
por
favor
Thought
I
said
to
wait,
had
four
doors
I
knock
a
nigga
face
off
Give
him
the
bottom
of
the
nine
like
a
baseball
scoreboard
(whatever..)
I
leave
the
club
with
my
tab
still
open
Won't
even
get
a
cab
for
you
and
your
friend
The
only
fear
I
have
is
of
loathing
And
I
won't
even
kick
in
'till
we
get
to
Las
Vegas
(Party,
do
it
'till
tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till
we
get
to
Las
Vegas
(Party,
do
it
'till
tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till
we
get
to
Las
Vegas
(Party,
do
it
'till
tomorrow)
Vegas
'Till
we
get
to
Las
Vegas
(Party,
do
it
'till
tomorrow)
Vegas
Whatever
happens
here,
stays
here
So
let's
go
all
the
way
here
Til
we
get
to
Las
Vegas

My

Grimy

I

Let

Pour

I

First
we
take
oath
Then
I'm
pulling
turquoise
strings
in
my
Lebron
corks
In
Turks
and
Caicos
I
came
from
wicked
chair
fame
wearin'
short
sets
I
learned
that
money
can't
buy
happiness
But
I
decided
I'd
rather
do
all
my
cryin'
in
the
Corvette
Make
a
dollar,
buy
a
suit
Have
a
child,
and
have
'em
follow

Wavin'
that

Make

Taking

Let's
skip
the
small
talk
and
get
right
to
the
wealth
Truth
is
I
give
a
fuck,
but
it's
right
to
myself
Fuck
fame,
keep
the
shit
I
write
to
myself
If
what
I
do
is
therapeutic,
man,
the
slightest
shit
helps
Made
angel
dust
my
freshman
year
Gave
it
a
try,
cool,
little
did
I
knew
Had
the
wrong
meaning
of
high
school
Teachers
called
him
a
sociopath
and
a
liar
Fuck
them,
only
went
to
class
for
the
cyphers
Now
I'm
gettin'
bills
for
The
same
thinking
they
tried
to
prescribe
pills
for
They
said
I
needed
a
wrench,
I'm
a
loose
screw
Vital,
suicidal,
said
I
would
kill
mi
amour
Wasn't
speakin'
in
French,
said
I'd
let

off
Never
know
who
or
what
you
might
get
Main
reason
they
never
want
me
to
set
it
off
You
now
dealing
with
four
niggas
that's
never
off
All
bets
off,
so
nah,
you
won't
be
better
off
Ya'll
ready,
ya'll
ready,
y'all
ready
know,
Slaughterhouse
Jewish
tats
arm
on
my
arm
like
a
Semitic
boss
Egyptian
art
hanging,
uh,
that's
my
Kemetic
cross
Slaughterhouse
set
it
off
Even
got
bitches
wavin'
our
flag,
Betsy
Ross
Old
school
Chevy,
the
head
is
off
Decapitated
Impala
Heavy
lack
from
the
weight
of
the
llama
Still
bear
arms
like
a
shaven
koala
How
you
thinkin'
like
a
faded
neurology
student
Is
prudent
when
chasin'
a
dollar
So
never
mind,
a
clever
rhyme
I'd
rather
find
a
better
grind,
forever
times
Sittin'
behind
me
because
I'm
ahead
of
mine
In
this
era
I'm
livin'
outside
of
the
paradigm
I'm
comin'
outside
with
a
pair
of
dimes
Sharon
and
Caroline
Share
a
line
then
they
share
a
9
inch,
never
mind
I
probably
shouldn't
even
keep
going
Cause
these
rappers
keep
hoein'
with
their
teeth
showing
I
set
it
off
Ya'll
ready,
ya'll
ready,
y'all
ready
know,
Slaughterhouse
Feels
like
a
close,
it's
coming
to
Fuck
am
I
gonna
do?
It's
too
late
to
start
over
This
is
the
only
thing
I,
thing
I
know
Sometimes
I
feel
like
all
I
ever
do
is
Find
different
ways
to
word
the
same,
old
song
Ever
since
I
came
along
From
the
day
the
song
called
'Hi!
My
Name
Is''
dropped
Started
thinking
my
name
was
fall
Cause
anytime
things
went
wrong
I
was
the
one
who
they
would
blame
it
on
The
media
made
me
the
equivalent
of
a
modern-day
Genghis
Kahn
Tried
to
argue
it
was
only
entertainment,
dawg
Gangsta?
Naw,
courageous
balls
Had
to
change
my
style,
they
said
I'm
way
too
soft
And
I
sound
like
AZ
and
Nas
out
came
the
claws
And
the
thing's
been
out
since
then
But
up
until
the
instant
that
I've
been
against
it
It
was
ingrained
in
me
that
I
wouldn't
amount
to
a
shitstain
I
thought
No
wonder
I
had
to
unlearn
everything
that
my
brain
was
taught
Do
I
really
belong
in
this
game?
I
pondered
I
just
wanna
play
my
part,
should
I
make
waves
or
not?
So
back
and
forth
in
my
brain
the
tug
of
war
wages
on
And
I
don't
wanna
seem
ungrateful
or
disrespect
the
artform
I
was
raised
upon
But
sometimes
you
gotta
take
a
loss
And
have
people
rub
it
in
your
face
before
you
get
made
pissed
off
And
keep
pluggin',
it's
your
only
outlet
And
your
only
outfit,
so
you
know
they
gonna
talk
about
it
Better
find
a
way
to
counter
it
quick
and
make
it,
ah
Feel
like
I've
already
said
this
a
kabillion
eighty
times
How
many
times
can
I
say
the
same
thing
different
ways
that
rhyme?
What
I
really
wanna
say
is,
is
there
anyone
else
who
can
relate
to
my
story?
Bet
you
feel
the
same
way
I
felt
when
I
was
in
the
same
place
you
are,
when
I
was
afraid
to
Afraid
to
make
a
single
sound
Afraid
I
will
never
find
a
way
out,
out,
out
Afraid
I
never
before
I
didn't
wanna
go
another
round
An
angry
man's
power
will
shut
you
up
Trip
wires
fill
this
house
with
tip-toe
love
Run
out
of
excuses
with
every
word
So
here
I
am
and
I
will
not
run
Guts
over
fear,
(The
time
is
here)
Guts
over
fear,
(I
shall
not
tear)
For
all
the
times
I
let
you
push
me
around
and
let
you
keep
me
down
(Now
I
got)
Guts
over
fear,
guts
over
fear
Feels
like
a
close,
it's
coming
to
Fuck
am
I
gonna
do?
It's
too
late
to
start
over
This
is
the
only
thing
I,
thing
I
know
It's
like
I
was
there
once,
single
parents
Hate
your
appearance,
did
you
struggle
to
find
your
place
in
this
world?
And
the
pain
spawns
all
the
anger
on
But
it
wasn't
until
I
put
the
pain
in
songs
learned
who
to
aim
it
on
That
I
made
a
spark,
started
to
spit
hard
as
shit
Learned
how
to
harness
it
while
the
reins
were
off
And
there
was
a
lot
of
bizarre
shit,
but
the
crazy
part
Was
soon
as
I
stopped
saying
"I
gave
a
fuck"
Haters
started
to
appreciate
my
art
And
it
just
breaks
my
heart
to
look
at
all
the
pain
I've
caused
But
what
am
I
gonna
do
when
the
rage
is
gone?
The
lights
go
out
in
the
trailer
park
And
the
window
that
was
closing
and
there's
nowhere
else
I
can
go
with
flows
in
And
I'm
frozen
cause
there's
no
more
emotion
for
me
to
pull
from
Just
a
bunch
of
playful
songs
that
I
made
for
fun
So
to
the
break
of
dawn
here
I
go
recycling
the
same
old
song
But
I'd
rather
make
Not
Afraid
2
than
another
make
mothafuckin'
We
Made
You
uh
Now
I
don't
wanna
seem
indulgent
when
I
discuss
my
lows
and
my
highs
My
demise
and
my
uprise,
pray
to
God
I
just
opened
enough
eyes
later
on
Gave
you
the
supplies
and
the
tools
to
hopefully
use
it
to
make
you
strong
And
enough
to
lift
yourself
up
when
you
feel
like
I
felt
Cause
I
can't
explain
to
y'all
how
dang
exhausted
my
legs
felt
Just
having
to
balance
my
damn
self
Those
dang
eggshells,
I
was
made
to
walk
But
thank
you
ma,
cause
that
gave
me
the
Strength
to
cause
Shady-mania,
so
many
empty
that
stadium
At
least
I
made
it
out
of
that
house
and
a
found
a
place
in
this
world
when
the
day
was
done
So
this
is
for
every
kid
who
all's
they
ever
did
was
dreamt
that
one
day
they
would
just
get
accepted
I
represent
him
or
her,
or
anyone
similar
you
are
the
reason
that
I
made
this
song
Everything
you're
scared
to
say
don't
be
afraid
to
say
no
more
From
this
day
on
forward,
just
let
them
a-holes
talk
Take
it
with
a
grain
of
salt
and
eat
their
fucking
faces
off
The
legend
of
the
angry
blonde
lives
on
through
you
when
I'm
gone
And
to
think
I
was...
Afraid
to
make
a
single
sound
Afraid
I
will
never
find
a
way
out,
out,
out
Afraid
I
never
before
I
didn't
wanna
go
another
round
An
angry
man's
power
will
shut
you
up
Trip
wires
fill
this
house
with
tip-toe
love
Run
out
of
excuses
with
every
word
So
here
I
am
and
I
will
not
run
Guts
over
fear,
(The
time
is
here)
Guts
over
fear,
(I
shall
not
tear)
For
all
the
times
I
let
you
push
me
around
and
let
you
keep
me
down
(Now
I
got)
Guts
over
fear,
guts
over
fear
These
donuts
are
delicious...
son
of
a
bitch!
We
got
a
1094

Hines
Road,
requesting
backup.
Repeat,
1094

Hines
Road

southbound.
I'm

pursuit!
Pick

My

ties
Up

ride
Stick

head

the
water,

flap
his
lips
Motormouth,

a
wave,

Roll
Tide
You're
playin'
golf
in
lightning,
so

I
Dressed
in
a
tin
man
suit
Drinkin'
a
tin
can
too,
that
is
110
proof
Man
if
I
only
had
a
heart
for
you
bitches
I'd
get
down
on
my
knees
and
help
you
dig
them
ditches
But
mama
only
raised
Hell
So
when
you're
done
diggin'
that
ditch,
bitch,
bury
yourself
Pass
me
that
Colt
45
I'm
partyin'
'til
my
fuckin'
throat
sore
and
dry
I'm
goin'
down
Aww
man
you
gotta
love
it
I'm
on
my
way
Hey
mama,
all
around
the
town
they're
sayin'
"He's
goin'
down,
Lord
have
mercy"
I'm
country
rich,
no
budget
Got
to
get
paid
Hey
daddy,
all
around
the
town
they're
sayin'
"He's
goin'
down,
Lord
have
mercy"
You
drivin'
drunk,
better
lift
your
seat
up
Cause
cops
pull
us
over
just
to
fuckin'
meet
us
Cause
Marshall's
a
Rap
God,
damn
right
Well
I
guess
that
makes
me
Jesus
So
turn
this
water
to
whiskey
Watch
the
dirty
south
go
from
dirty
to
filthy
High
class
only
means
stoned
in
school
Joints
rolled
up
bigger
than
pony
stool
Smoke,
stains
on
the
roof
of
the
old
Regal's
brown
So
what
I
got
spokes
on
this
bitch,
and?
The
lift
kicks
like
climbin'
into
a
spaceship
UFO's,
unidentified
flyin'
Oldsmobiles
And
mobile
homes,
amen
I
can
still
smell
the
kerosene
leakin'
I
should've
seen
the
signs,
I
was
blowin'
up
Either
in
a
trailer
home
or
a
pickup
Hey,
Bubba,
your
baby
boy
is
in
big
trouble
I
fuckin'
ran
through
a
briar
patch
and
got
cut
up
Now
I'm
wide
open
in
front
of
the
whole
town
I
bled
for
the
game,
I
guess
it's
obvious
now
I'm
goin'
down
now,
he
told
me
wear
it
with
pride
You
wanna
take
the
hard
road
you
gotta
cherish
the
ride
Most
mothafuckas
won't
jump
to
embarrass
the
fly
Can't
build
a
legacy
up,
then
let
it
perish
and
die
I'm
goin'
down
Aww
man
you
gotta
love
it
I'm
on
my
way
Hey
mama,
all
around
the
town
they're
sayin'
"He's

I'm

Another

me
when
I
was
a
kid
Son
please
don't
make
me
some
type
of
hero
Cause
I
will
say
some
inspirational
shit
in
a
real
way
But
will
still
have
a
field
day
with
some
of
the
Fucked
up
shit
in
the
world
and
tell
it
to
suck
the
dick
Cause
I
still
make
fun
of
a
situation
Someone's
in
like
a
son
of
a
bitch
At
anothers
expense,
I'm
fuckin'
relentless
As
fuck
when
it
comes
to
this
pen
I
struggle
with
coming
to
my
senses
Stuck
on
the
fence
on
a
balance
beam
if
I
seem
unbalanced
It's
challenging
but
my
conscience
allows
me
to
think
The
most
foulish
childish
things
without
even
blinking
Without
even
thinkin'
about,
all
the
stinkin'
amounts
of
people
that
seem
to
be
reachin'
in
the
crowds
I'm
scream
in
the
palace,
sold
out
this
evening
But
now
it's,
maybe
down
to
sleeping
Is
it
really
my
soul
to
keep
or
Have
I
sold
it
cheap
is
it
greed
Do
I
take
more
than
I
need
When
I
joke
about
leavin'
But
keep
over
achievin'
Because
whats
stolen
from
me
barely
broke
even
It's
a
fine,
fine
line
It's
a
fine,
fine
line
So
I
notice
how
I
paint
myself
And
through
my
hair
when
ordeals
I'm
so
vain
I
want
my
respect
but
ignore
the
Butterfly
effect
that
comes
from
my
dialect
Till
I,
sit
in
the
dark
and
I
reflect
And
my
reflection
shows
what
it's
like
here
Cause
this
vanity,
surrounded
by
all
these
lights
yeah
It's
like
a
nightmare
I
said,
this
vanity
surrounded
by
these
lights
is
a
nightmare
And
I
don't
like
how
I
see
myself
so
I
Open
the
Bible
to
Isaiah
cause
I
swear
to
Christ
there
are
nights
where
I
stay
up
at
night
just
to
say
a
prayer
twice
Just
to
make
sure
God
hears
cause
this
ice
layer
Ice
skate
on
tonights
where
Put
in
it
but
I
like
stands
Feistier
then
a
triceritops
and
like
a
dice
player
I
got
a
nice
pair
of
dice
here
Sealed
off
in
my
lair
Away
from
the
bullshit
good
safe
place
to
sit
and
talk
shit
From
this
house
it's
quite
big,
but
it
ain't
when
you
can't
leave
it
And
I
feel
so
isolated,
nice
I
made
it
But
it's
like
I
payed
the
price
of
fame
twice
I
hate
it
So
I
bitch
about
my
life
then
make
another
song,
it's
a
cycle
ain't
it
Then
I
wonder
why
I'm
still
famous
Keep
walkin'
the
line
This
gold
fish
poke
it's
old
But
especially
when
you
don't
know
If
your
conscience
is
sayin'
I
told
you
so
You
don't
even
know
anymore
if
you
got
the
soul
of
a
soldier
Or
if
you
sold
your
soul
It's
a
fine,
fine
line
It's
a
fine,
fine
line
And
from
here
you
look
so
small
Hovering
high
above
us
all
Please
come
back,
to
me
I
still
remember
the
times
when
They
were
simpler
than
the
rhymes
of
Vanilla
Ice
were
when
I
was
just
killin'
the
mics
I'll
never
forget
what
that
feeling
was
like
God,
I
miss
those
times
now
when
I
was
just
starting
out
Without
a
diamond,
now
I'm
diamond
I
can't
even
stage
dive
in
the
crowd
anymore
now
when
I've
been
Stuck
in
this
house
hibernate
Hate
even
going
outside
it
Sucks,
sometimes
I
just
wanna
walk
in
Target
and
look
at
shit
Browse,
I
don't
even
want
to
buy
nothin'
I
just
wanna
fuckin'
walk
around
inside
it
Look
how
excited,
I
sound
when
I
get
to
talkin'
bout
life
and
Everything
about
it
I
miss
Which
now
reminds
me
Put
a
thousand
lighters
in
the
sky
for
the
Outsidaz
Wow,
I
must
have
had
Alzheimers
Long
time
since
I
shouted
them
out,
bout
time
Cause
it's
been
on
my
mind
lately
how
Zee
you
always
supported
me
You
vouched,
I
will
never
forget
that
and
How
you
guys,
accepted
me
for
me
and
Pace
I
love
you
too,
you
slept
on
my
couch
And
I
been
thinkin'
bout
the
time
I
slept
on
the
floor
at
the
outhouse
Rhyming
is
all
we
ever
wanted
to
do
And
regardless
how
life
has
turned
out
Inside
I'll
always
be
an
outsider
My
life
has
been
turned
inside
out
but
I
It's
a
fine,
fine
line
It's
a
fine,
fine
line
He's
had
that
stone
face,
as
if
I'm
not
here
Can't
you
see
that
I've
been
crying?
I
didn't
know
you'd
be
insane
Dreams
can
be
so
deceiving
You're
an
itch
I
can't
reach
A
wound
that
won't
heal
The
smell
of
skin
that's
burning
I
didn't
know
you'd
be
insane
But
it's
true,
and
just
say
all
I
am
to
you
Is
a
pain
in
my
neck,
thorn
in
my
side
Stain
on
my
blade,
blood
on
my
knife
Been
dreaming
of
her,
all
of
my
life
But
she
won't
come
true,
she's
just
my
nightmare
I
woke
up
to
She's
twisted,
he's
a
rebel
she's
set,
he's
hard
to
handle
The
worst
part
of
all
is
he
just
don't
care
She's
twisted
like
a
rope,
that
is
wrapped
around
his
throat
But
the
worst
part
of
all
is
she
really
don't
give
a
(She
don't
give
a
shit)
Sometimes
I
wish
that
you'd
just
die
Cause
I'm
too
afraid
of
leaving
I
didn't
know
you'd
be
insane
Dreams
can
be
so
deceiving
(How
did
it
come
to
this?
Why
do
I
fantasize
to
kill
you
when
you're
sleeping?)
I
didn't
know
you
feel
the
same
When
I
say
you're
no
good
All
you
are
to
me
Is
a
pain
in
my
neck,
thorn
in
my
side
Stain
on
my
blade,
blood
on
my
knife
Been
dreaming
of
her,
all
of
my
life
But
she
won't
come
true,
she's
just
my
nightmare
I
woke
up
to
She's
twisted,
he's
a
rebel
she's
set,
he's
hard
to
handle
The
worst
part
of
all
is
he
just
don't
care
She's
twisted
like
a
rope,
that
is
wrapped
around
his
throat
But
the
worst
part
of
all
is
she
really
don't
give
a
(She
don't
give
a
shit)
Love
ain't
no
fairytale,
love
is
a
buried
nail
Inside
of
this
heart
of
stone,
so
you
wanna
get
married?
Well
Romeo,
Romeo,
smokin'
blow
with
Antonio
In
the
back
alley
takin'
shots
of
whiskey
and
only
gold
Juliet's
at
the
nudie
bar,
doin'
God
only
knows
Neither
one
of
'em
came
to
see
the
dog
and
the
pony
show
But
a
bitch
is
a
bitch,
and
a
horse
is
a
horse
And
I'm
sorry
I
can't
afford
to
get
your
daddy's
old
Porsche
painted
Sorry
Juliet
that
you
embedded
the
sayin'
If
a
dollar
makes
you
holler
then
I'm
gettin'
the
short
change
of
it
Feel
like
I've
been
asleepin'
alone
and
lovin'
this
angel
Tangled
between
a
dream
and
a
coma
Walkin'
the
edge
of
this
cliff,
like
a
sheep
to
it's
owner
Then
wake
up
to
this
fuckin'
bitch
with
an
evil
persona
Now
if
you
say
that
you
hate
somebody
and
you
livin'
with
them
Then
they
pack
up
and
leave
and
you
bitch
about
how
you
miss
'em
You
gotta
see
the
pattern
of
the
blood
all
over
the
steerin'
wheel
Love
is
a
cannibal
ridin'
a
carnival
carousel
'Round
and
'round
we
roll,
where
it
stops,
baby
nobody
knows
Some
people
go
crazy
and
they
lose
control
Some
people
jump
off,
some
people
won't
let
go
Some
people
say
love,
some
people
say
why
Some
people
don't
love,
they
just
want
a
free
ride
The
rain
won't
stop,
it'll
never
dry
If
she's
in
the
house
of
pain
then
love
is
standin'
outside
She's
twisted,
he's
a
rebel
,
she's
set,
he's
hard
to
handle
The
worst
part
of
all
is
he
just
don't
care
She's
twisted
like
a
rope,
that
is
wrapped
around
his
throat
But
the
worst
part
of
all
is
she
really
don't
give
a
(She
don't
give
a
shit)
Maybe
I'm
a
twisted
one
that
screwing
this
up
So
I
guess
this
means
Goodbye,
for
now
I
feel
phenomenal
as
usual
Pharmaceuticals,
glue
sniff
and
pools
of
vomit
at
Bonnaroo
But
I
don't
know
if
I'm
in
Tennessee,
Chicago,
or
Houston
In
the
corner
trying
to
seek
solitude
Shallow
but
such
a
hollow
dude
I
won't
even
swallow
solid
food
Alcoholic
too,
plus
I'm
on
lean
like
the
Tower
of
Pisa
Top
it
off
I'm
on
mushrooms
so
fuck
all
of
you
Roses
to
violet
mollies
are
blue
Lost
in
a
ball
of
confusion
It's
all
an
illusion
It's
probably
the
shrooms
I'm
on
Cause
I
think
I
started
hallucinating
Cause
I
just
thought
I
just
heard
Jay
Electronica
and
Odd
Future's
new
shit
And
all
I
can
do
is
follow
the
music
And
end
up
with
Paula
Abdul
at
Lollapalooza
Fillin'
water
balloons
with
nail
polish
remover
Just
a
problem
in
wallowing
fumes
I
feel
a
type
I
gotta
get
looser
After
I
finish
polishing
off
this
bottle
of
booze
I
got
a
solution
Concentrated
like
orange
juice
so
I'm
not
as
diluted
Cause
all
this
delusion
got
me
seein'
shit
Excusez-moi
but
that
coochie
that
passed
You
see
her
ass?
Wouldn't
make
her
my
main
squeeze
but
Juicier
ass,
it
belongs
in
a
juicer
It's
mouth
waterin'
too
so
I
walked
up
to
it
like
I'm
Marshall
Wanna
try
to
meet
my
standards?
I'll
Introduce
ya
Oh
I'm
a
misogynist
too
but
I'm
not
a
masseuse
But
my
attitude
is
rubbin'
off
on
the
youth
A
chronic
abuser,
not
only
user
of
marijuana
I
mean
verbal
assault
that
I
use
to
smoke
all
of
you
losers
Got
a
bazooka,
a
shotgun,
a
ruger,
a
Glock,
and
a
nuke
And
a
Rottweiler
too,
I'm
not
in
the
mood
so
When
I
say
I'm
bringing
the
tec
out
I'm
not
coming
to
repair
your
fuckin'
electronic
computers
God,
I'm
gonna
puke
I'm
so
gone
off
the
hookah
I
think
I
swallowed
a
loser
I'm
tore
up,
demolished
a
fuckin'
stone
like
Oliver
Like
I
looked
Medusa
in
the
eyeball
to
seduce
her
The
thoughts
I
produce
are
The
thoughts
I
produce
are
loony
tunes
With
latex
gloves
and
the
socks
and
shoes
To
replace
next
up
Veronica's
boobs
And
a
paychecks
that
were
stuffed
in
a
glove
box
In
a
blue
honda
with
used
condoms
were
clues
the
The
girl
was
just
not
the
one
suitable
for
him
Right
for
me
Will
change
me
rearrange
my
head
to
be
Just
right
for
you
and
me,
don't
laugh,
please
listen
Don't
laugh,
please
listen
Thought
I'd
give
in
into
the
pressure
Collapse
and
crumble
perhaps
Relapsing
under
that
Well
thats
a
bunch
of
crap
In
the
clutch,
I'm
the
Captain
Crunch
of
rap
And
I'm
sick
in
fact
and
humble
thats
enough
of
that
Fuck
that
shit,
cut
the
sack
Like
its
a
natural
reaction
Thats
why
I'm
actually
trapped
in
this
shoving
match
Cause
push
keeps
coming
to
that
I
can
keep
getting
my
ass
kicked,
keep
it
coming
back
Like
a
sarcastic
crumpled
sack
of
shit
so
mad
Disgruntled
had
some
struggles
yeah
But
that
passionate
hunger's
back
The
fantastic
juggling
act
And
the
way
I
flip
my
tongue
on
the
track
It's
like
verbal
acrobatics
But
in
fact
Last
time
I
tried
to
pull
off
a
dramatic
stunt
as
drastic
I
fuckin'
crashed
my
hovercraft
After
I
strapped
the
duffel
bag
to
my
back
And
stuck
the
massive
punchin'
bag
in
it
An
elastic
bungee
strap,
proper
plaster,
a
thumb
tack
And
a
piece
of
plastic
bubble
wrap
Went
spastic
and
fuckin'
snapped
Jumped
and
splashed
in
a
puddle
of
battery
acid
Stumbled
back,
recovered,
back
flipped
And
landed
on
a
gymnastic
tumble
mat
And
for
my
last
trick,
lunge
on
back
lash
On
a
NASA
shuttle
flap,
fuckin'
snapped
the
rudder
in
half
Chuckled
and
laughed,
buttaled
my
last
rebuttal
And
just
asked
him
to
come
crash
And
I
go
grab
my
go-go-gadget
inflatable
gigantic
humongous
mattress
And
ceramic
construction
hat
Rubbed
my
magic
mushroom
tat
Fell
off
then
splat,
get
up
from
that
Face
taped
to
a
waste
paper
basket
Throw
up
then
gas,
lungs
collapse
And
that's
more
likely
to
find
someone
that
Right
for
me
Will
change
me
rearrange
my
head
to
be
Just
right
for
you
and
me,
don't
laugh,
please
listen
Don't
laugh,
please
listen
Couple
of
shots
of
Jäger
Public
intoxication,
dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Fluttered
with
thoughts
of
anger
While
I
was
away
I
know
probably
some
of
you
got
to
thinkin'
"You're
top
ten
ain't
cha?"
stop
cause
you
fuckers
are
talkin'
crazy
And
stop
interrupting
you're
not
even
up
in
the
conversation
Whether
you're
punchin'
a
clock
or
famous
Underground,
pop,
or
nameless,
whatever
your
job
is
I
can't
fuck
with
your
occupation
You're
thinkin'
just
cause
you
came
in
with
scrubs
And
you
brought
the
scalpel
and
sponge
The
oxygen
tank
and
the
suction
and
shot
the
brain
surgeon
Stuck
in
the
operating
room
Once
you
done,
swapped
your
name
with
him
Smuggled
in
Ronald
Reagan
If
you
duck
him
up
Donald
Fagen
While
juggling
waffles
baking
Fuckin'
McDonalds
egg
and
cheese
sausage
bagel
finagle
They
flung
it
across
the
table
Then
bump
it
and
knock
it
shake
it
Jumped
and
got
in
the
way
then
disrupted
my
concentration
I
said
fuck
it
and
lost
my
patience
Since
they
all
woke
up
from
sedation
Ain't
none
of
you
Doctor
Dre
So
then
what
does
it
got
you
thinkin'
That
you
can
fuck
with
this
operation
Aftermath,
still
running
hip-hop
amazing
I'm
still
pluggin'
along
No
need
for
an
assumption
Here's
confirmation
I'm
up
for
the
long
duration
I'm
just
looking
for
something
to
walk
away
with
Some
pocket
change
and
a
little
integrity
Though
I'll
probably
be
jumpin'
across
the
stage
Till
I'm
fuckin'
Madonna's
age
Stuck
in
an
awkward
place
in
my
life
But
I
shit
you
not
like
I'm
fucked
up
with
constipation
That
day
will
come
before
I
stumble
upon
some
ladies
Right
for
me
Will
change
me
rearrange
my
head
to
be
Just
right
for
you
and
me,
don't
laugh,
please
listen
Don't
laugh,
please
listen
Tell
'em
if
they
want
it,
they
can
come
get
that
(static)
I
swear
I
love
my
city,
I
just
want
a
little
(static)
See
me,
they
salute
me,
they
ain't
ready
for
that
(static)
Detroit
vs.
Everybody
I
took
a
bite
out
the
rotten
apple
by
the
poison
tree
All
these
females
need
to
email
to
make
noise
And
I
think
it's
changin'
a
lot,
he
fuck
with
my
authority
Then
he
shall
see
shells,
but
not
by
the
seashore
If
he
gang
bangin'
or
not
It's
simple
as
the
alphabet
He
F
with
me,
that
G
shall
surely
see
He
definitely
is
'bout
it,
it's
retail
fraud,
he's
weak
The
honest
gesture,
the
trigger
finger
'round
the
diamond
tester,
we
tail
flaw
with
heat
The
same
soldier,
it's
me,
myself
and
I
Ridin'
'round
shootin'
my
biopic
and
my
autobiography
Range
Rover,
this
ain't

You

makeup,
we
thinkin'
Lark
Voorhies
face
The
twin
Eagle's,
an
Aries
coupe,
might
as
well
ride
by
in
an
ambulance
My
parachute
like
skydivin'
in
Hammer
pants
So
call
it
siblin'
rivalry
Take
his
life,
call
it
the
unforgivable
robbery
A
wise
man
told
me
that
holdin'
a
grudge
is
like
Lettin'
somebody
just
live
inside
of
your
head
rent
free
(Real
talk)
I
don't
got
time
to
evict
these
clowns
Y'all
niggas
been
bitches,
that's
none
of
my
business,
but
I
don't
sip
tea
(That's
Nickel)
Ride
around
his
block
All
he
knows
is
pitfalls,
that's
why
he's
always
climbin'
out
his
drop
(I
got
a
question)
Do
you
wanna
ride
or
die?
Welcome
to
Detroit,
mothafucka
Boy
I
need
no
halves
and
halves,
I
want
the
game
in
entirety
100
percent
cut,
no
stitches
required
Welcome
to
Detroit
where
if
you
get
that
promotion
Don't
worry,
man
them
bullets
will
still
be
at
your
ass
firin'
I
still
call
it
safe,
I
would
suck
if
I
was
umpirin'
Boy
I
hit
the
beat
I
just
treat
that
shit
like
a
diary
I'm
offended
if
you
hear
my
new
shit
and
you
ain't
rewindin'
me
Self
made,
I
never
needed
your
bail
or
a
wire,
see
I'm
never
callin'
collect,
I
call
to
collect
My
homie
wanted
a
Chevy
so
I
put
my
dog
in
the
vet
Plus
I'm
so
loyal
that
that
paper,
boy,
is
all
that
I
fetch
Got
the
ball
in
my
hand
and
the
ball
in
the
net
Bitch
I'm
the
D,
can't
no
offense
dunk
on
me
I'm
Mr.
Big
Shot,
these
hoes
get
drunk
off
me
I'm
overrespected,
my
mama
gated
community's
overprotected
So
futuristic,
I'm
already
over
my
next
bitch
Reminiscin'
on
listenin'
to
50
fifty
times
a
day
Back
when
tenth
grade
was
like
fifty
days
away
Tryna
get
paid
fifty
ways
a
day
Used
to
put
fifty
on
the
layaway,
now
my
closet
fifty
shades
of
grey
Twenty
six
and
I
done
lived
a
lifetime
a
few
times
From
futons
to
Grey
Poupons
In
church
tryna
get
a
little
savings,
yeah
coupons
I
spit
that
A1
every
day,
I'm
hittin'
new
primes
Now
the
stakes
high,
niggas
surprised
at
the
new
lines
Or
takin'
down
my
number
like
"you
still
ain't
got
a
new
line?"
Nah
it's
the
same,
we've
been
laborin'
for
years
I
know
it
took
way
longer
than
nine
months,
but
fuck
it,
it's
all
in
due
time
I
turned
a
blunt
to
a
roach
with
dreams
of
bein'
a
Beatle
though
Don't
want
to,
I
need
to,
gotta
learn
to
keep
it
cerebral
When
you
come
up
in
a
place
where
everyone
got
a
piece
but
ain't
peaceful
This
is
just
part
one,
wait
'til
the
sequel
Tell
'em
if
they
want
it,
they
can
come
get
that
(static)
I
swear
I
love
my
city,
I
just
want
a
little
(static)
See
me,
they
salute
me,
they
ain't
ready
for
that
(static)
Detroit
vs.
Everybody
Comin'
from
them
streets
where
they
thirsty,
starvin'
to
eat
Just
a
step
away
from
felon,
that's
why
they
call
it
the
D
On
your
bleeder,
ho,
reason
for
all
of
this
honesty
Honestly
no
honor
roll,
but
honored
up
in
these
streets
Cause
I'm
a
Linwood
nigga,
them
young
niggas
say
Put
a
stack
on
your
head,
you'll
bleed
a
lake
on
Grand
River
And
to
think
y'all
hood
harder
then
I
might
beg
to
differ
Know
some
killers
pull
the
trigger
for
a
Swisher
and
Molly
In
a
blink
I'll
hit
your
kisser,
bet
you
ass
ain't
rememberin'
They
say
my
city's
tougher
than
two
fat
bitches
scissoring
So
nigga
I'm
a
veteran,
retire
my
letterman
I
had
K's
in
front
ya
school,
but
I
ain't
go
to
Kettering
Cough
up
a
lung,
313
where
I'm
from
Xan
got
me
cross
eyed
like
Bernstein's
son
And
these
niggas
try
to
copy
but
I
hold
on
this
time
It's
us
vs.
them,
Detroit
vs
Everybody
Lately
it
seems
as
if
it's
me
against
the
world
Like
it
was
before
my
life
became
a
movie
And
they
used
to
use
my
mothafuckin'
trailer
to
tease
me
with
But
I
flipped
that
script
like
AB
filler
Painkillers
to
pop
that
lid
off
that
safety
seal
It
made
me
feel
amazing,
made
me
celebrate
me
And
if
I
may
reiterate,
I
ain't
even
need
a
script
I
ain't
bein'
conceited
But
I
made
it
to
radio,
eat
a
dick
I
still
never
ABC
the
shit
Mainstream
appeal
and
the
skill
is
what
made
me
iller
Since
before
they
called
Jay
Dee
Dilla
I
was
daydreamin'
one
day
I
would
be
the
shit
And
if
I
ever
end
up
escapin'
the
streets
I
swear
that
I
would
stay
here
Still
in
it,
I'm
crazy,
I'll
always
be
real
Don't
make
me
steal
an
18
wheeler
Break
all
of
my
friends
out
of
here
and
take
'em
straight
to
the
Mercedes
dealer
Peel
off
back
to
the
same
block
that
we
came
from,
on
a
rampage
You
crazy
for
me
to
flip
What's
makin'
you
think
I
need
a
switch?
Cause
I'm
Adrian
Peterson
When
he's
raging
and
heated
and
on
the
way
to
go
beat
his
kid
On
the
track
I
spank
like
he
just
did
(DETROIT!)
I
can't
never
leave
this
bitch
Sick
of
bein'
treated
like
me
and
shit
But
Jesus,
I
can
just
see
why
people
quit
callin'
me
to
do
features
And
them
cyphers
on
BET
cause
if
I
wasn't
me
I
probably
wouldn't
want
to
play
with
me
neither,
shit
Seems
to
be
reachin'
this
fever
pitch
180
degrees
in
here
trying
to
wait
for
the
cedar
chips
MCs
just
bit
off
more
than
they
can
chew
like
a
face
full
of
Swedish
Fish
Or
Lorena
with
two
penises
Hateful
ingeniousness,
this
inconvenience
And
for
the
record,
you
won't
want
this
kind
of
static
in
your
life
When
I'm
makin'
you
cling
to
it
They
consider
tryna
reinsulate
yah
when
it's
maybe
in
for
another
crazy
winter
It's
so
cold
in
the
D,
it
is
as
days
begin
to
tick
away
But
ain't
this
what
really
made
me
into
the
angry
bitter
blonde
Sick
of
bein'
underdog
Don't
make
me
unleash
this
shit,
release
this
Pit
May
even
seem
as
if
I'm
yankin'
your
chain
a
bit
or
maybe
the
way
in
which
I'm
sayin'
shit
Is
playin'
with
your
relation,
changin'
it
It's
still
the
same
and
Shady's
still
a
lady
killer
Since
the
day
I
went
insane
and
attacked
the
baby
sitter
With
a
potato
peeler
and
mushed
her
face
into
the
entertainment
center
It's
like
another
plane
just
entered
into
Ukraine
again
The
Bermuda
Triangle
and
attempted
to
make
a
safe
descent
Awaiting
anyone
who
ain't
affiliated,
it
could
be
danger
Did
you
make
arrangements
with
the
gangsters
'fore
you
came
here?
And
if
they
mention
us
Tell
'em
if
they
want
it,
they
can
come
get
that
(static)
I
swear
I
love
my
city,
I
just
want
a
little
(static)
See
me,
they
salute
me,
they
ain't
ready
for
that
(static)
Detroit
vs.
Everybody
What
up
though,
it's
the
godfather
Trick
Trick.
You
either
ridin'
with
us
or
gettin'
rolled
on.
That
means
Detroit
vs.
Everybody!
Hey
Em
let
me
get
that
instrumental
take
it
down
to
the
hood,
let
the
little
homies
get
this
remix
crackin'.
Detroit!
Look,
if
you
had
one
shot,
one
opportunity
To
seize
everything
you
ever
wanted-One
moment
Would
you
capture
it
or
just
let
it
slip?
His
palms
are
sweaty,
knees
weak,
arms
are
heavy
There's
vomit
on
his
sweater
already,
mom's
spaghetti
He's
nervous,
but
on
the
surface
he
looks
calm
and
ready
To
drop
bombs,
but
he
keeps
on
forgettin
What
he
wrote
down,
the
whole
crowd
goes
so
loud
He
opens
his
mouth,
but
the
words
won't
come
out
He's
chokin,
how
everybody's
jokin
now
The
clock's
run
out,
time's
up
over,
bloah!
Snap
back
to
reality,
Oh
there
goes
gravity
Oh,
there
goes
Rabbit,
he
choked
He's
so
mad,
but
he
won't
give
up
that
Easy,
no
He
won't
have
it
,
he
knows
his
whole
back's
to
these
ropes
It
don't
matter,
he's
dope
He
knows
that,
but
he's
broke
He's
so
stacked
that
he
knows
When
he
goes
back
to
his
mobile
home,
that's
when
it's
Back
to
the
lab
again
yo
This
whole
rap
shit
He
better
go
capture
this
moment
and
hope
it
don't
pass
him
You
better
lose
yourself
in
the
music,
the
moment
You
own
it,
you
better
never
let
it
go
You
only
get
one
shot,
do
not
miss
your
chance
to
blow
This
opportunity
comes
once
in
a
lifetime

This

yo
The
soul's
escaping,
through
this
hole
that
it's
gaping
This
world
is
mine
for
the
taking
Make
me
king,
as
we
move
toward
a,
new
world
order
A
normal
life
is
borin,
but
superstardom's
close
to
post
mortem
It
only
grows
harder,
only
grows
hotter
He
blows
us
all
over
these
hoes
is
all
on
him
Coast
to
coast
shows,
he's
know
as
the
globetrotter
Lonely
roads,
God
only
knows
He's
grown
farther
from
home,
he's
no
father
He
goes
home
and
barely
knows
his
own
daughter
But
hold
your
nose
cuz
here
goes
the
cold
water
His
hoes
don't
want
him
no
mo,
he's
cold
product
They
moved
on
to
the
next
schmoe
who
flows
He
nose
dove
and
sold
nada
So
the
soap
opera
is
told
and
unfolds
I
suppose
it's
old
partna',
but
the
beat
goes
on
Da
da
dum

You

No
more
games,
I'ma
change
what
you
call
rage
Tear
this
mothafuckin
roof
off
like
2
dogs
caged
I
was
playin
in
the
beginnin,
the
mood
all
changed
I
been
chewed
up
and
spit
out
and
booed
off
stage
But
I
kept
rhymin
and
stepwritin
the
next
cypher
Best
believe
somebody's
payin
the
pied
piper
All
the
pain
inside
amplified
by
the
fact
That
I
can't
get
by
with
my
9
to
5
And
I
can't
provide
the
right
type
of
life
for
my
family
Cuz
man,
these
goddam
food
stamps
don't
buy
diapers
And
it's
no
movie,
there's
no
Mekhi
Phifer,
this
is
my
life
And
these
times
are
so
hard
and
it's
getting
even
harder
Tryin
to
feed
and
water
my
seed,
plus
See
dishonor
caught
up
between
being
a
father
and
a
prima
donna
Baby
mama
drama's
screamin
on
and
Too
much
for
me
to
wanna
Stay
in
one
spot,
another
day
of
monotony
Has
gotten
me
to
the
point,
I'm
like
a
snail
I've
got
to
formulate
a
plot
fore
I
end
up
in
jail
or
shot
Success
is
my
only
mothafuckin
option,
failure's
not
Mom,
I
love
you,
but
this
trailer's
got
to
go
I
cannot
grow
old
in
Salem's
lot
So
here
I
go
is
my
shot.
Feet
fail
me
not
cuz
maybe
the
only
opportunity
that
I
got
You
better
lose
yourself
in
the
music,
the
moment
You
own
it,
you
better
never
let

This

yo
You
can
do
anything
you
set
your
mind
to,
man
I
walk
on
water
But
I
ain't
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
But
only
when
it
freezes
(fuck)
Why,
are
expectations
so
high?
Is
it
the
bar
I
set?
My
arms,
I
stretch,
but
I
can't
reach
A
far
cry
from
it,
or
it's
in
my
grasp,
but
as
Soon
as
I
grab,
squeeze
I
lose
my
grip
like
the
flying
trapeze
Into
the
dark,
I
plummet
Now
the
sky's
blackening,
I
know
the
mark's
high
Butterflies
rip
apart
my
stomach
Knowing
that
no
matter
what
bars
I
come
with
You're
gonna
hark,
gripe,
and
that's
a
hard
Vicodin
to
swallow
So
I
scrap
these,
as
pressure
increases,
like
khakis
I
feel
the
ice
cracking,
because
I
walk
on
water
But
I
ain't
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
But
only
when
it
freezes
It's
the
curse
of
the
standard
That
the
first
of
the
Mathers
disc
set
Always
in
search
of
the
verse
that
I
haven't
spit
yet
Will
this
step
just
be
another
misstep
To
tarnish
whatever
the
legacy,
love
or
respect
I've
garnered?
The
rhyme
has
to
be
perfect,
the
delivery
flawless
And
it
always
feels
like
I'm
hitting
the
mark
'TIl
I
go
sit
in
the
car,
listen,
and
pick
it
apart
Like,
"this
shit
is
garbage"
God's
given
me
all
this
Still
I
feel
no
different
regardless
Kids
look
to
me
like
as
a
god,
this
is
retarded
If
only
they
knew,
it's
a
facade
and
it's
exhaustive
And
I
try
to
not
listen
to
nonsense
But
if
you
bitches
are
trying
to
strip
me
of
my
confidence
Mission
accomplished
I'm
not
God-sent
Nas,
Rakim,
Pac,
B.I.G.,
James
Todd
Smith,
and
I'm
not
Prince,
so
I
walk
on
water
But
I
ain't
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
But
only
when
it
freezes
'Cause
I'm
only
human,
just
like
you
Making
my
mistakes,
oh
if
you
only
knew
I
don't
think
you
should
believe
in
me
the
way
that
you
do
'Cause
I'm
terrified
to
let
you
down,
oh
It's
true,
I'm
a
Rubik's,
a
beautiful
mess
At
times
juvenile,
yes,
I
goof
and
I
jest
A
flawed
human,
I
guess
But
I'm
doing
my
best
to
not
ruin
your
ex-
pectations
and
meet
'em,
but
first,
the
"Speedom"
verse
Now,
Big
Sean,
he's
going
too
fast
Is
he
gonna
shout
or
curse
out
his
mom?
There
was
a
time
I
had
the
world
by
the
balls,
eating
out
my
palm
Every
album,
song
I
was
spazzin'
the
fuck
out
on
And
now
I'm
getting
clowned
and
frowned
on
But
the
only
one
who's
looking
down
on
me
that
matters
now's
Deshaun
Am
I
lucky
to
be
around
this
long?
Begs
the
question,
though
Especially
after
the
methadone
As
yesterday
fades
and
the
Dresden
home
is
burnt
to
the
ground
And
all
that's
left
of
my
house
is
lawn
The
crowds
are
gone
And
it's
time
to
wash
out
the
blonde
Sales
decline,
the
curtains
drawn
They're
closing
the
set,
I'm
still
poking
my
head
out
from
behind
And
everyone
who
has
doubt,
remind
Now
take
your
best
rhyme,
outdo
it,
now
do
it
a
thousand
times
Now
let
'em
tell
ya
the
world
no
longer
cares
or
gives
a
fuck
about
your
rhymes
And
as
I
grow
outta
sight,
outta
mind,
I
might
go
outta
mine
'Cause
how
do
I,
ever
let
this
mic
go
without
a
fight
When
I
made
a
fuckin'
tightrope
outta
twine?
But
when
I
do
fall
from
these
heights,
though,
I'll
be
fine
I
won't
pout
or
cry
or
spiral
down
or
whine
But
I'll
decide
if
it's
my
final
bow
this
time
around
'cause...
I
walk
on
water
But
I
ain't
no
Jesus
I
walk
on
water
But
only
when
it
freezes
'Cause
I'm
only
human,
just
like
you
Making
my
mistakes,
oh
if
you
only
knew
I
don't
think
you
should
believe
in
me
the
way
that
you
do
'Cause
I'm
terrified
to
let
you
down,
oh
If
I
walked
on
water,
I
would
drown
'Cause
I'm
just
a
man,
but
as
long
as
I
got
a
mic
I'm
godlike
So
me
and
you
are
not
alike
Bitch,
I
wrote
"Stan"
And
I,
started
from
the,
bottom
Like
a,
snowman,
ground
up
Like
round
chuck,
and
still
put
hands
on
you
Staying
wound
up
is
how
I
spend
time
Sucker
free,
confidence
high
Such
a
breeze
when
I
pin
rhymes
I
just
got
the
air
about
me
Like
wind
chimes
(yeah)
Another
day
in
the
life
(uh)
Used
to
have
to
scrape
to
get
by
(yeah)
Now
my
community
is
gated
And
I
made
it,
and
my
neighbors
say
hi
(say
hi)
I'm
giving
them
pounds,
I'm
upscale
now
Guess
it
means
I'm
way
in
the
sky
But
I
still
remember
the
days
of,
minimal
wage
for
General
labor,
welfare
recipients
is
a
minor
Look
at
how
government
assistance
has
made
ya
Adversity,
if
at
first
if
you
don't
succeed
Put
your
temper
to
more
use
'cause
being
broke
is
a
poor
excuse
That
shit
only
gives
you
more
fuel
Show
them
why
you're
you
So
close,
God,
it's
like
I
almost
got
it
But
close
only
counts
in
timebombs
and
horseshoes
So
I
uni-bomb
shit
(tick,
tick,
tick)
No
remorse
Screw
it,
I'm
lit,
and
that
attitude
I
blew
up
on
quick
That's
why
they
call
me
firecracker
I
grew
up
on
wick
(wick,
wick,
wick)
with
a
short
fuse
I
got
some
important
news
to
report
to
Anyone
who
thought
I
was
done,
nah,
bitch,
not
quite
Spotlight's
back
on,
got
my
faith,
where's
yours?
Do
you
still
believe
In
me?
Didn't
I
get
everything
I
had
to
give
you
to
make
you
see?
I'll
never
forget
if
you
turn
your
back
on
me
Now
and
walk
out
I
will
never
let
you
live
it
down
(I'll
never
quit)
Do
you
still
believe?
In
me?
Man
I
know
sometimes
these
thoughts
can
be
harsh
and
cold
as
ice
To
me,
they're
just
ink
blots
I
just
fling
them
like
slingshots,
and
so
precise
So
you
might
want
to
think
it
over
twice
When
you
retards
can
roll
the
dice
But
beef
will
at
least
cost
you
your
career
'Cause
even
my
cheap
shots
are
overpriced
But
this
middle
finger's
free
as
a
bird
New
warhead-ed
birth,
you
just
forehead-ed
on
earth
Too
short
for
a
verse,
studied
his
formula
Learned
how
to
incorporate
a
curse
Point
it
towards
corporate
America
Stick
a
fork
in
it
and
turn
'Cause
four-letter
words
are
more
better
Heard
the
world
force-fed
a
turd
to
me
You're
getting
yours
But
sometimes
I
overdo
it
But
I
just
get
so
into
it
I
was
there
consoling
you
when
no
one
knew
it
When
your
situation
showed
no
improvement
I
was
that
door,
you
walked
over
to
it
I'm
the
light
at
the
end
of
tunnel
so
people
are
always
looking
at
me
as
they're
going
through
it
When
that
tunnel
vision
is
unclear,
shit
becomes
too
much
to
bear
Since
"Cleaning
Out
My
Closet"
when
I
was
having
trouble
with
the
snare
I'm
that
unrealistic
prayer
answered
And
I'ma
get
you
jacked
up,
like
you're
trying
to
fix
a
flat
(uh),
when
you
struggle
with
the
spare
That
double
fisted
bear,
knuckles
coupled
with
this
pair
of
nuts
I'm
cupping
I
am
your
fucking
switch,
nothing
can
compare
Do
you
still
believe
In
me?
Didn't
I
get
everything
I
had
to
give
you
to
make
you
see?
I'll
never
forget
if
you
turn
your
back
on
me
Now
and
walk
out
I
will
never
let
you
live
it
down
(I'll
never
quit)
Do
you
still
believe?
In
me?
Started
from
the
bottom
like
a
snowman
Oh
man,
put
that
in
your
corncob
pipe
and
smoke
that
But
my
battery's
low
I'm
gonna
need
a
booster
in
my
pack
I
know
I
always
got
Proof
on
my
back
I
called
you
a
groupie
'cause
I
knew
for
a
fact
My
insulin
ho
Homie
I'm
calling
on
you
'cause
I
think
I'm
slowly
startin'
to
lose
faith
in
it,
so
Give
me
that
inkling
and
motivation
to
go
Motivation
to
go,
Hussein
with
the
flow
Fake
fans
with
the
two-faced
that
show
Let
heartbeats
loot,
produce
hate
in
my
soul
Laying
vocals
two
days
in
a
row
True
statement,
hate
to
go
down
this
road
But
there's
only
one
route
to
cross
this
bridge
So
I
walk
in
this
bitch
with
loose
chains
'Cause
all
my
dues
paid
But
this
booth
is
taking
its
toll
But
it's
never
too
late
to
start
a
new
beginning
That
goes
for
you
too
So
what
the
fuck
you
gon'
do,
use
the
tools
you're
given?
Or
are
you
going
to
use
the
cards
you
were
dealt
as
an
excuse
for
you
to
not
do
shit
with
them
I
used
to
play
the
loser
victim
'Til
I
saw
the
way
Proof
was
driven
I
found
my
vehicle
and
I
haven't
ran
out
of
gas
yet
And
when
they
stacked
decks,
turn
handicaps
into
assets
Fanny
packs,
hourglasses
If
time
was
still
on
my
side,
I'd
still
have
none
to
waste
Man,
in
my
younger
days,
that
dream
was
so
much
fun
to
chase
It's
like
I
run
in
place
while
this
shit
dangled
in
front
of
my
face
But
how
do
you
keep
up
the
pace
and
the
hunger
pains
once
you've
won
the
race?
When
that
pool
of
exhaust
is
cooling
off
'Cause
you
don't
got
nothing
left
to
prove
at
all
'Cause
you
done
already
hit
them
with
the
coup
de
grâce
Still
you
feel
the
need
To
go
through
and
deal
with
that
Bruce
Willis
That
blue
still,
that
truth
still
When
that
wheel's
loose,
I
won't
lose
will
Do
you
still
believe?
Instinctive
nature,
to
bring
the
anguish
(yeah)
to
the
English
language
With
this
ink,
you
haters
get
wrote
on
like
a
piece
of
paper
This
rap
shit
got
me
travelin'
place
to
place,
you
barely
leave
your
house
'Cause
you're
always
stuck
at
your
pad,
it's
stationary
Yeah,
that's
why
when
I
brainstorm,
gotta
write
it
out
Simon
Cowell
of
rhymin'
foul,
that's
why
you
sound
so
shook
Wire
bound
notebook
got
tied
around
your
throat
Hook
it
inside
your
mouth,
go
"HRUHHH"
That's
what
it's
like
when
the
mic
is
out
'Cause
I'm
tearin'
at
your
flesh
with
it
'Til
your
larynx
and
neck
are
split
With
these
lyrics,
weapons
expert
with
Like
hair
extensions,
extra
clips
And
you're
scared
to
effin'
death
of
it
Bitch,
you're
starin'
at
a
legend
that
In
a
pair
of
Sketcher,
sweatshirt
ripped
And
hoodie
black,
should
be
strapped
to
a
chair
or
stretcher
Electric,
swear
on
every
record,
bitch
Finger
so
high
in
the
air,
I
bet
your
senses
flip
Like
a
barometric
pressure
switch
Carin'
less
who
I
offend
with
this
I'm
at
your
neck
like
Pez
dispense
Go
'head,
spit
your
flow,
bitch...
I'm
at
your
throat
like
chloraseptic,
'septic
And
you
got
strep,
I'm
too
complex
with,
'plex
with
This
shit
I
wrote
is
on
some
next
shit,
next
shit
I'm
at
your
throat,
I'm
feelin'
reckless,
reckless,
yeah
And
I'll
take
a
hundred
of
you,
hundred
of
you
All
at
once
like
I
had
nothin'
to
lose,
what
can
I
do?
My
appetite
for
destruction
is
loose,
destruction
is
loose
And
all
at
once
just
to
have
somethin'
to
chew,
somethin'
to
chew
Somethin'
to
chew
Yeah,
uh
And
still
conjoined
at
the
hip
with
hop
Still
on
point
and
poignant
Skilled
as
Floyd
is
And
it's
filled
and
still
no
filter,
boy
I'll
put
you
in
your
place
(yeah)
like
a
realtor,
boy
You
still
ain't
in
the
buldin',
boy
I
will
destroy
shit,
even
as
I
build
it
Get
the
drill
bit,
pen
is
filled
with
poison
Which
is
the
source,
easy
to
still
pinpoint
it
Like
what?
Like
a
real
thin
joint,
it
What?
Comes
on
Quilted
Northern
And
what?
In
a
built-in
toilet
Yeah,
bitch
I
told
you
I'm
a
dog
(woof,
woof)
I
wouldn't
heal
with
ointment
Way
I'm
kickin'
these
fairies
tails
Should
write
a
children's
storybook
(yeah)
Million
voices
in
my
head,
but
still
get
a
little
bit
of
thrill
And
some
real
enjoyment
Off
what?
Off
the
feel
of
going
in
Like?
Like
your
bitch
when
she
gives
me
brain
Like
she
thinks
I'm
dumb
Grabs
the
crown
of
my
dick
and
blows
me
to
kingdom
come
'Til
I
feel
anointed
She
makes
iller
noises
When
she's
with
me,
must
be
from
the
Windy
City
Pretty
apparent,
she's
a
M.I.L.F.
when
blowin'
me
'Cause
like
Kandor
and
two,
rippin'
the
condom
in
two,
woo!
Dick
is
a
bargain
or
two,
now
I'm
gettin'
blue
like
Kolonopins
Rude
Jude
I
go
there,
you
wouldn't
Well,
I
still
have
a
few
views,
and
comment
on
you
Just
not
YouTube,
'cause...
I'm
at
your
throat
like
chloraseptic,
'septic
And
you
got
strep,
I'm
too
complex
with,
'plex
with
This
shit
I
wrote
is
on
some
next
shit,
next
shit
I'm
at
your
throat,
I'm
feelin'
reckless,
reckless,
yeah
You're
a
has-been
That
has
been
the
case
since
back
when
You
last
went
and
threw
your
hat
in
the
race
You've
been
trash
Stick
your
raps
in
the
trash
bin
Or
end
up
in
my
next
rhyme
You're
a
fuckboy,
so
next
time
It's
gonna
be
heads
flyin'
like
Dez
Bryant
With
a
TEC-9
against
Rex
Ryan,
yeah!
Now
watch
me
set
it
like
correct
time
All
you
get
is
sloppy
seconds
like
a
Timex
I
Clock
rejects
into
the
next
life
Talkin'
reckless,
that
is
just
my
Strongest
suit,
but
you
can
get
my
Columbian
neck
tie
Prostitute
just
climb
in
the
Humvee
and
lets
ride
Why
you
hitching
at
night?
I
put
an
end
to
your
life
(sex
crime)
Kidding
aside,
insidious
vibe
Girl,
you
know
you
got
the
prettiest
eyes
But
all
you're
getting
is
bribe
Ending
your
life
to
try
to
get
you
inside
Then
we
gon'
end
up
spending
the
night
And
I'm
skinning
your
hide
like
an
Indian
tribe
What
kind
of
nut
drives
a
Budweiser
truck
Finds
a
slut,
tries
to
surprise
her,
cuffs,
ties
her
Up,
binds
up,
cuts,
slices
her
twice
But
the
muff
diver
must
just
like
it
rough
Fuck
right
in
her
vagina,
blood
Flies
up,
under
thighs,
ugh,
like
a
geyser,
uh
Music,
please
Enthusiast,
of
the
roofie
Goal
is
to
get
a
floozie
inside
the
jacuzzi
And
have
a
loosie,
goosey
as
coozie
is
with
an
Uzi
But
I
am
to
rap
what
blue
jeans
mean
to
Bruce
Springsteen
Glued

I'm
truTV,
you're
too
PG
I'm
Schoolly
D,
you're
spoony,
G
No
diss
there,
just
notice
there
are
no
similarities
that
we
share
Besides
the
fact
we
breathe
air
Happily
married,
to
rap
and
I'm
glad
that
we
buried
The
hatchet
and
patched
it
up
Now
I'm
back
to
ratchet
up
my
attack
And
I'm
at
your
mothafuckin'
throat
like...
Chloraseptic,
'septic
And
you
got
strep,
I'm
too
complex
with,
'plex
with
This
shit
I
wrote
is
on
some
next
shit,
next
shit
I'm
at
your
throat,
I'm
feelin'
reckless,
reckless,
yeah
And
I'll
take
a
hundred
of
you,
hundred
of
you
All
at
once
like
I
had
nothin'
to
lose,
what
can
I
do?
My
appetite
for
destruction
is
loose,
destruction
is
loose
And
all
at
once
just
to
have
somethin'
to
chew,
somethin'
to
chew
Somethin'
to
chew
Hands
up,
officer
don't
shoot
Then
pull
your
pants
up,
promise
you
won't
loot
We
may
never
understand
each
other
it's
no
use
We
ain't
ever
gonna
grasp
what
each
other
goes
through
Black
boy,
black
boy,
we
ain't
gonna
lie
to
you
Black
boy,
black
boy,
we
don't
like
the
sight
of
you
Pull
up
on
the
side
of
you
Window
rolled
down,
profiled
And
then
we
wonder
why
we
see
this
side
of
you
Probably
coming
from
the
dope
house
We
can
let
you
slide
but
your
tail
light
is
blew,
out
We
know
you're
hiding
that
Heidi
Klum
on
you
And
you're
on
another
drug
charge,
homie,
it's
back
inside
for
you
And
just
in
case
a
chase
might
ensue,
we
got
that
tried
and
true
pistol
drew
right
at
you
we
be
delighted
to
unload
it
In
your
bedroom,
walk
up,
and
lay
that
taser
in
the
side
of
you
What
the
fuck
am
I
gonna
do?
I
keep
telling
myself
keep
doing
like
you're
doing
No
matter
how
many
lives
you
ruin
It's
for
the
red,
white
and
blue
Time
to
go
find
a
new
one
and
split
his
head
right
in
two
No
one's
ever
indicted
you
Why?
'Cause
you're
a
white
boy,
white
boy
You're
a
rockstar
(My
momma
talk
to
me
Try
to
tell
me
how
to
live)
White
boy,
white
boy,
in
your
cop
car
(But
I
don't
listen
to
her
'Cause
my
head
is
like
a
sieve)
White
boy,
white
boy,
you're
untouchable
(The
world's
coming
to
an
end,
I
don't
even
care)
Nobody
can
tell
me
shit
'cause
I'm
a
(big
rockstar)
Black
boy,
black
boy,
we
don't
get
your
culture
and
We
don't
care
what
our
government's
done
to
fuck
you
over,
man
Don't
tell
us
your
attitude's
a
result
of
that
Balderdash,
where'd
you
get
the
chip
on
your
shoulder
at
Why
you
kicking
that
soda
can?
Pull
your
pants
up
We
bought
to
roll
up,
and
Throw
your
ass
in
the
van,
cuffed
You
don't
have
to
know
our
plan
or
what
our
intentions
are
Our
guns
are
close
to
our
chest
You
better
show
your
hands
And
put
our
minds
more
at
ease
And
you'll
get
shot
in
the
thyroid,
'cause
you
might
die,
boy
We
fighting
a
crime
war
Here
come
the
swine
Tryna'
clean
up
these
streets
from
all
these
minorities
That's
why
we
call
them
pigstye's
for
They're
like
eyesores
to
police
Talk
to
you
like
you're
a
piece
of
trash
Feels
like
we're
stuck
in
a
time
warp
to
me
As
I
kick
these
facts,
and
Get
these
mixed
reactions
As
this
beat
backspins
It
like
we're
drifting
back
into
the
60s
Having
black-skin
is
risky,
'cause
this
keeps
happening
Throughout
history,
African-American's
have
been
treated
like
shit
And
I
admit,
there
have
been
times
where
it's
been
embarrassing
to
be
a
'Cause
you're
a
white
boy,
white
boy
You're
a
rockstar
(My
momma
talk
to
me
Try
to
tell
me
how
to
live)
White
boy,
white
boy,
in
your
cop
car
(But
I
don't
listen
to
her
'Cause
my
head
is
like
a
sieve)
White
boy,
white
boy,
you're
untouchable
(The
world's
coming
to
an
end,
I
don't
even
care)
Nobody
can
tell
me
shit
cause
I'm
a
(big
rockstar)
Seems
like,
the
average
lifespan
of
a
white
man
Is
more
than
twice
that
of
a
black
life-spanner
Wonder
if
sometimes
it
has
a
fight
scanner
I
feel
like
checking
out
on
life,
can't
escape
my
circumstance
I'd
rather
hear
them
say
"Die
N-word"
than
Die
Antwoord
Ninja,
now
it's
better
to
describe
banter
But
that's
life
Strapped,
'cause
we're
strapped
financially
And
can't
find
answers
We're
applying
for
McDonald's
It
seems
like
the
only
franchise
that'll
hire,
so
how
can
we
have
higher
standards
As
Dallas
overshadows
the
battle
for
Black
Lives
Matter
We
fight
back
with
violence
But
acts
like
that
are
Black
eyes
on
the
movement
Which
makes
wack
lives
madder
At
cops
and
cops
madder
And
that's
why
it's
at
a
stalemate
Can't
arrive
at
a
compromise
so
it's
Black
Ops
I
wonder
if
we
hire
more,
black
cops,
the
crap
stops
The
block
is
our
backyard
offices
Not
the
crack
spot
Call
the
attack
dogs
off
of
us,
man
You
always
act
pissed
off
at
us
a
traffic
stop
And
bad
cops
fuck
it
up
for
good
cops
And
man,
stop,
sending
white
cops,
into
black
neighborhoods
'Cause
they
ain't
acclimated
to
'em
Like
that's
the
way
to
do
it
Who's
seen
some
fuckin'
videos
of
rappers
waving
guns
And
no
nobody
black
so
they
act
afraid
of
us
And
that's
racism
Fear
to
the
black
face
gives
them
A
subconscious
racist
Wait,
why
is
there
black
neighborhoods?
'Cause
America
segregated
us
Designated
us,
to
an
area
Separated
us
Section-eight'd
us
When
we
tear
it
up's
the
only
time
attention's
paid
to
us
And
education
sucks,
every
days
another
Freddie
Grey
for
us,
a
levy
breaks
or
fuzz
Why
is
it,
they
treat
us
like
dryer
lint?
We
just
want
a
safe
environment
for
our
kids,
but
can't
escape
The
sirens
Don't
take
a
scientist
to
see
our
violent
nature
lies
In
The
poverty
that
we
face
so
the
crime
rate's
the
highest
in
The
lowest
classes,
its
like
a
razor
wire
fence
And
we're
trapped
in,
these
racial
biases
That
plague
our
society
which
makes
our
anxiety
levels
raise
Every
time
we
see
a
devil's
face
Lions,
tigers
and
bears
oh
my!
More
like
billy
clubs
and
Gats
And
we
really
love
it
when
you
think
we're
guilty
cause
We're
black
"But
you
kill
each
other,
facts-
you
peel
each
Others
caps,
for
silly
stuff
like
hats
Single
mother
strugglin'
through
substance
abuse
While
people
with
nothing
to
lose
shoot
each
other
for
shoes
Fuck
your
republican
views
Pull
ourselves
up
by
our
bootstraps,
where
the
fuck
is
the
boots?
And
streets
act
as
a
narrator
Don't
gotta
read
comics
Or
be
that
into
characters,
just
to
see
that
just
to
be
black,
you
better
be
strapped,
with
a
derringer-
or
be
capped
in
America
like
Steve
Rogers
'Cause
no
one
overseas,
these
cops,
and
Always
see
some
B
charges
We
see
them
beat
Rodney
King
and
got
off
So
we
don't
need
all
your
crooked
police
peace
officer
offerings
Just
keep
marching,
til'
we
reach
congress
But
they
gonna
say
you're
tying
to
take
an
irrational
stance
cause
you
try
to
slander
the
flag
But
somebody
has
to
be
the
sacrificial
lamb
So
they
call
it
a
Kapernick
tantrum
if
you
don't
stand
for
the
national
anthem
We
raised
it,
you
better
praise
it
or
you'll
be
made
to
feel
like
a
traitor,
we'll
Treat
you
like
Rodney
Dangerfield
Home
of
the
bravest
still,
racist
spills
So
the
whole
nation
feels
like
a
plantation
field
In
a
country
that
claims
that
it
was
foundation
on
based
on
united
states
ideals
That
had
its
Natives
killed
Got
you
singing
the
Star
Spangled
Banner
to
a
piece
of
cloth
that
represents
the
land
of
the
free
that
made
people
slaves
to
build
I've
been
a
liar,
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover,
been
a
cheat
All
my
sins
need
holy
water,
feel
it
washin'
over
me
A
little
one,
I
don't
want
to
admit
to
something
If
all
it's
gonna
cause
is
pain
Truth
in
my
lies
right
now
are
falling
like
the
rain
So
let
the
river
run
He's
coming
home
with
his
neck
scratched
to
catch
flack
Sweat
jackets
and
dress
slacks,
mismatch
On
his
breast
jackets
is
sex
addict
And
she
just
wants
to
exact
revenge
and
get
back
It's
a
chess
match,
she's
on
his
back
like
a
jetpack
She's
kept
track
of
all
his
internet
chats
And
guess
who
just
so
happens
to
be
moving
on
to
the
next?
Actually,
just
shit
on
my
last
chick
and
she
has
what
my
ex
lacks
'Cause
she
loves
danger,
psychopath
And
you
don't
fuck
with
no
man's
girl,
even
I
know
that
But
she's
devised
some
plan
to
stab
him
in
the
back
Knife
in
hand,
says
the
relationship's
hanging
by
a
strand
So
she's
been
on
the
web
lately
Says
maybe
she'll
be
my
Gwen
Stacy,
to
spite
her
man
And
I
know
she's
using
me
to
try
to
play
him,
I
don't
care
Hi
Suzanne,
but
I
shoulda'
said
"Bye
Suzanne"
after
the
first
night,
but
tonight
I
am
I've
been
a
liar,
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover,
been
a
cheat
All
my
sins
need
holy
water,
feel
it
washin'
over
me
A
little
one,
I
don't
want
to
admit
to
something
If
all
it's
gonna
cause
is
pain
The
truth
in
my
lies
now
are
falling
like
the
rain
So
let
the
river
run
One
night
stand
turned
into
night
stayin'
It
was
cold,
some
lights
gram,
y'all
be
hung
tight
and
He
found
out,
now
she
feels
deserted
and
used
'Cause
he
left,
so
what?
He
did
it
first
to
her
too
Now
how
am
I
supposed
to
tell
this
girl
that
we're
through?
It's
hard
to
find
the
words,
I'm
aloof,
nervous
and
suited
When
it's
too
hurt
but
what
you
deserve
is
the
truth
Don't
take
it
personal,
I
just
can't
say
this
in
person
to
you
So
I
revert
to
the
studio
like
Hole
In
The
Wall
diners
Don't
have
to
be
reserved
in
a
booth
I
just
feel
like
the
person
who
I'm
turnin'
into
is
Irreversible,
I
prayed
on
you
like
it's
church
at
the
pew
And
now
that
I
got
you
I
don't
want
you
Took
advantage
of
my
thirst
to
pursue
Why
do
I
do
this
dirt
that
I
do?
Get
on
my
soapbox
and
preach,
my
sermon
in
speech
Detergent
and
bleach
is
burned
in
the
womb
'Cause
now
with
her
in
the
womb
We
can't
bring
her
in
this
world,
shoulda'
knew
To
use
protection
'fore
I
bit
into
your
forbidden
fruit
Fuck!
I've
been
a
liar,
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover,
been
a
cheat
All
my
sins
need
holy
water,
feel
it
washin'
over
me
A
little
one,
I
don't
want
to
admit
to
something
If
all
it's
gonna
cause
is
pain
The
truth
in
my
lies
now
are
falling
like
the
rain
So
let
the
river
run
My
name's
(ooh),
my
name's
(ooh)
Denver,
river
run
Call
me
(ooh),
call
me
(ooh)
River
(ooh),
we'll
let
the
river
run
Always
the
bride's
maid,
never
"The
bride,
hey!"
Fuck
can
I
say?
If
life
was
a
highway
The
sequels
are
non-clay
But
be
swerving
in
five
lanes
Speeds
that
are
high,
rave
like
I'm
sliding
on
ice
maybe
That's
what
I
made,
that
came
at
you
sideways
I
can't
keep
my
lies
straight,
what
I
made
You
terminate
my
baby
This
love
triangle
Left
us
in
a
wreck
tangled
What
else
can
I
say?
It
was
fun
for
a
while
That
I
really
woulda
loved
your
smile
Didn't
really
wanna
abort
But
fuck
it,
what's
one
more
lie
to
tell
an
unborn
child?
I've
been
a
liar,
been
a
thief
Been
a
lover,
been
a
cheat
All
my
sins
need
holy
water,
feel
it
washin'
over
me
A
little
one,
I
don't
want
to
admit
to
something
(I'm
sorry,
I
fucked
up)
if
all
it's
gonna
cause
is
pain
The
truth
in
my
lies
now
are
falling
like
the
rain
So
let
the
river
run
I
bust
in,
devilish
grin,
disgustin'
Asshole,
freckled
cheeks
and
a
butt
chin
Calling
all
party
animals,
get
on
the
floor
When
I
pop
up
on
some
Whack-A-Mole
shit
In
search
of
a
chick
who
stacked
them
so
thick
And
implants
are
so
big
She
can
hang
me
up
on
that
rack,
big
ol'
tits
Like
Anna
Nicole
Smith
Bodies
bananas
and
sass
to
go
wit'
I
spot
you
at
first
glance
and
go,
"shit"
You
wearin'
those
pants
that
don't
fit
That
butt
won't
ever
give
up
That's
why
you
stick
it
out
no
matter
what
'Cause
you
got
an
ass
that
won't
quit
So,
get
on
the
horn,
my
saxophone
Grab
hold
of
my
instrument,
get
a
grasp,
and
blow
You
just
laugh
and
go
heehee
'Cause
you're
just
as
nasty
so
that's
appropriate
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me
(yeah
me)
I
said
I
love
you,
'cause
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me,
nasty
(yeah,
me)
You
know,
I'm
wearin'
a
new
shirt
tonight
too,
yo
With
me
on
it
I'm
lookin'
at
your
tight
rear
like
a
sightseer
Your
booty
is
heavy
duty,
like
diarrhea
The
plan's
to
bring
you
to
my
house
You're
drinkin'
Jack
and
Beam
I'm
thinking
soon
as
trampolines
so
we
should
bounce
But
you're
out
of
your
tube-top
If
you're
thinking
that
mi
casa
es
su
casa
Yeah,
you're
a
cute
fox
Perfect
ten
so
back
that
up
like
a
moonwalk
Girl,
you're
smoking
like
Snoop
Dogg
But
you
must
be
Token
if
you
think
you're
taking
over
my
quarters
There
goes
the
dime
and
the
jukebox
Two
shots
of
blue
Hypnotic
and
soon
I'll
Turn
this
brooha
to
a
barroom
brawl
So
hit
scratch
on
the
break
like
the
cue
ball
Turn
the
volume
all
the
way
up
on
your
boombox
And
excuse
the
locker
room
talk,
I'm
just
too
raw
But
apparently,
so
are
you,
ma
'Cause
you
just
kicked
me
in
the
balls
and
told
me
to
screw
off
And
that's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me
(yeah
me)
I
said
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me,
nasty
(yeah,
me)
Said
can
I
take
you
home,
where
we
can
be
alone
Shawty,
you
the
shit
Girl,
I
ordered
you
to
sit
I
know
you're
probably
feeling
me
more
than
you
admit
Pull
up
a
chair,
sweetie,
let
me
order
you
a
drink
I
only
go
to
meetings
court-ordered
from
a
shrink
From
the
bottom
to
the
top,
floor
to
ceiling
You
ain't
run
of
the
mill,
you're
one
in
a
million
'Cause
real
tits
are
still
fun
But
everybody
knows
fake
tits
are
still
better
than
real
ones
So
come
and
spend
the
night
with
the
guy
most
are
terrified
of
But
tonight,
curiosity
overrides
ya
Besides
ya
fire
(i
love)
Like
a
starter
pistol
Crystal
and
slides
huns,
tonight
I'm
your
pilot
'Cause
you
should
be
up
in
the
sky,
girl,
you're
so
fucking
fly
You
belong
in
the
mile
high
club
So
come
on
baby,
the
night's
young
Don't
string
me
along,
I'm
highstrung
We
might
wind
it
up,
unbound
like
we're
trying
for
the
Cy
Young
Fuckin'
'fore
we
get
to
the
house,
screwin'
our
brains
out
Like
changing
a
lightbulb
That's
why
I
like
ya,
'cause
I'm
crazy
just
like
ya
Now
every
time
I
get
brain,
you
screw
mine
up
I
barely
can
think
straight,
your
head
game
is
a
mindfuck
So
ready,
set,
aim,
and
fire
Yes
babe,
I'm
fallin'
in
likeness
kinda
Why
I
love
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're

of
blue
Hypnotic
and
soon
I'll
Turn
this
brooha
to
a
barroom
brawl
So
hit
scratch
on
the
break
like
the
cue
ball
Turn
the
volume
all
the
way
up
on
your
boombox
And
excuse
the
locker
room
talk,
I'm
just
too
raw
But
apparently,
so
are
you,
ma
'Cause
you
just
kicked
me
in
the
balls
and
told
me
to
screw
off
And
that's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me
(yeah
me)
I
said
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me,
nasty
(yeah,
me)
Said
can
I
take
you
home,
where
we
can
be
alone
Shawty,
you
the
shit
Girl,
I
ordered
you
to
sit
I
know
you're
probably
feeling
me
more
than
you
admit
Pull
up
a
chair,
sweetie,
let
me
order
you
a
drink
I
only
go
to
meetings
court-ordered
from
a
shrink
From
the
bottom
to
the
top,
floor
to
ceiling
You
ain't
run
of
the
mill,
you're
one
in
a
million
'Cause
real
tits
are
still
fun
But
everybody
knows
fake
tits
are
still
better
than
real
ones
So
come
and
spend
the
night
with
the
guy
most
are
terrified
of
But
tonight,
curiosity
overrides
ya
Besides
ya
fire
(i
love)
Like
a
starter
pistol
Crystal
and
slides
huns,
tonight
I'm
your
pilot
'Cause
you
should
be
up
in
the
sky,
girl,
you're
so
fucking
fly
You
belong
in
the
mile
high
club
So
come
on
baby,
the
night's
young
Don't
string
me
along,
I'm
highstrung
We
might
wind
it
up,
unbound
like
we're
trying
for
the
Cy
Young
Fuckin'
'fore
we
get
to
the
house,
screwin'
our
brains
out
Like
changing
a
lightbulb
That's
why
I
like
ya,
'cause
I'm
crazy
just
like
ya
Now
every
time
I
get
brain,
you
screw
mine
up
I
barely
can
think
straight,
your
head
game
is
a
mindfuck
So
ready,
set,
aim,
and
fire
Yes
babe,
I'm
fallin'
in
likeness
kinda
Why
I
love
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me
(yeah
me)
I
said
I
love
you,
'cause
you
remind
me
of
me
That's
why
I
love
you,
'cause
you're
like
me,
nasty
(yeah,
me)
Yeah
Shout
to
everybody
Who's
been
on
this
trip
with
me
You
don't
have
to
agree
But
if
you
feel
like
me
Someone
get
this
aryan
a
sheet
Time
to
bury
him,
so
tell
him
to
prepare
to
get
impeached
Everybody
on
your
feet
This
is
where
is
where
terrorism
and
heroism
meets,
square
up
in
the
streets
This
chump
barely
even
sleeps
All
he
does
is
watch
Fox
News
like
a
parrot
and
repeats
While
he
looks
like
a
canary
with
a
beak
Why
you
think
banned
transgenders
from
the
military
with
a
tweet?
He's
trying
to
divide
us,
this
shit's
like
a
cult
But
like
Johnny,
he'll
only
unite
us
'Cuz
nothing
drives
us
inside
like
this
fight
does
Similar
to
when
two
cars
collide
'cause
our
spirits
are
crushed
This
spot's
a
tight
one
But
here
the
jaws
of
life
come
to
pull
us
from
the
wreckage
That's
what
we
get
pride
from
When
we
can't
wear
stars
and
stripes
'cause
this
type
of
pickle
we're
in
is
hard
to
deal
But
there's
always
tomorrow
still
If
we
start
from
the
scratch
like
a
scab
for
scars
to
heal
And
band
together
for
Charolettesville
And
for
heaven's
fallen
heroes
Fill
his
wall
with
murals,
Nevada
get
up
Hit
the
damn
resetter,
let's
start
from
zero
This
is
our
renewal,
spray
tan
get
ride
of
Get
a
brand
new,
better,
America
And
here's
to
where
we're
from
This
is
where
it
all
began,
all
began
(stand
up)
Here's
to
the
land
that
made
me
And
made
me
who
I
am,
who
I
am
(hands
up)
Here's
to
the
land
that
raised
me
There's
home
for
the
only
place
that
really
knows
me
From
the
cracks
in
the
road
that
drove
me
There's
no
place
like
home
Didn't
wanna
piss
your
base
off,
did
ya?
Can't
denounce
the
klan,
'cause
they
play
golf
with
ya
You
stay
on
Twitter,
made
to
get
your
hate
off,
Nazi
I
do
not
see
a
way
y'all
differ,
at
all
You
got
a
race
card
with
a
swastika
with
your
name
carved
in
it
Then
it
should
be
your
trademark,
all
you
did
is
play
off
You
played
off,
so
I
guess
it
pays
to
feed
off
of
chaos
So
basically,
you
Adolf
Hitler
But
you
ain't
ruining
our
country,
punk
You
won't
take
our
pride
from
us
You
won't
define
us
'Cause
like
a
dictionary,
things
are
looking
up
So
much,
got
a
sprained
neck
Knew
we
would
rise
up
Against
this
train
wreck
and
take
a
stand
Even
if
it
mean
sitting
when
they
raise
the
flag
This
ain't
the
Star
Spangled
Banner
This
man
praised
a
statue
of
General
Lee,
'cause
He
generally
hates
the
black
people,
degrades
hispanics
Take
it
back
to
the
Shady
national
convention
Wish
I
would
have
spit
on
him
before
I
went
to
shake
his
hand
at
the
event
Or
maybe
had
the
wherewithal
to
know
that
he
was
gonna
try
to
Thought
he
was
gonna
tear
apart
a
sacred
land
We
cherish
and
stand
for,
so
Hands
in
the
air,
let's
hear
it
for
The
start
of
a
brand
new
America
Without
him,
we
can
be
proud
of
where
we're
from
And
here's
to
where
we're
from
This
is
where
it
all
began,
all
began
(stand
up)
Here's
to
the
land
that
made
me
And
made
me
who
I
am,
who
I
am
(hands
up)
Here's
to
the
land
that
raised
me
There's
home
for
the
only
place
that
really
knows
me
From
the
cracks
in
the
road
that
drove
me
There's
no
place
like
home
I
won't
give
up
I
won't
give
up
on
my
home,
that
so
many
died
for
You
already
know
that
I
won't
give
up
I
won't
give
up
on
my
home,
that
so
many
died
for
You
already
know
there's
no
place
like
home,
no
place
like
home
Wherever
I
go,
no
place
like
home
No
place
like
home,
no
place
like
home
Wherever
I
go
This
is
where
it
all
began,
all
began
(stand
up)
Here's
to
the
land
that
made
me
And
made
me
who
I
am,
who
I
am
(hands
up)
Here's
to
the
land
that
raised
me
There's
home
for
the
only
place
that
really
knows
me
From
the
cracks
in
the
road
that
drove
me
There's
no
place
like
home
We
never
saw
from
each
other's
sides,
or
eye
to
eye
Just
eye
for
eye,
lie
for
lie,
fight
or
flight
So
much
baggage,
need
a
luggage
rack
But
we
carry
on
with
our
public
spats
and
our
feuds
Oh,
back
in
the
news,
love
taps
when
I
dissed
you
Like
it
was
fun,
actually
used
to
run
Back
to
the
booth,
jump
back
in
the
studio
Give
you
a
tongue,
lasher
than
you
Laughed
at
a
stomach
tat
with
the
tomb
Stoning
was
funny,
back
in
our
youth
But
then
it
wasn't
after
we
knew
That
we
were
done
and
actually
through
(and
actually
through)
But
if
there's
one
fraction
of
truth
If
it
could
be
spun
back
I
would
do
so
many
things
different
'Cause
it
was
such
a
dumbass
excuse
You
hit
me
once,
and
that
I
would
use
To
continue
the
pattern
of
abuse
Why
did
I
punch
back?
Girls,
your
dad
is
a
scumbag
I'm
confused
because
How
come
you
can
be
a
lord
and
a
loser
How
come,
how
come,
you
can
be
a
liar
and
a
good
father?
A
good
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
Why
are
you
a
good
father
A
great
dad,
but
a
bad
husband?
You
wouldn't
beat
our
love
with
a
writer's
block
Just
a
line
that's
hot,
that
I
forgot
We
laughed
a
little,
cried
a
lot
I'll
never
forget
when
you
came
home
and
you
held
Hailie
Day
before
you
went
to
jail
and
daily
How
we
would
wait
for
that
mail
lady
Or
by
the
phone,
for
mom
to
call
And
I
watch
you
pull
yourself
up
And
we
decided
on
giving
it
one
more
try
despite
it
all
You're
my
lightning
rod
when
my
sky
gets
dark
I'm
your
shiny
rocks
in
that
tiny
box
When
we
tied
the
knot,
when
we
broke
the
knot
Every
line
we
crossed,
we
were
supposed
to
not
Every
time
we
fought,
being
stones
they
got
Thrown
too
far
Words
that
we
said
that
we
didn't
mean
The
words
that
we
meant
that
we
didn't
say
The
ones
that
we
thought
that
shoulda
said
Letters
written
that
we
coulda
read
Which
maybe
woulda
lead
to
some
good
instead
And
had
this
put
to
bed
But
I'd
be
lying
still
if
I
wasn't
sitting
here
asking
myself
How
come
you
can
be
a
lord
and
a
loser
How
come,
how
come,
you
can
be
a
liar
and
a
good
father?
A
good
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
Why
are
you
a
good
father?
A
great
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
(dad)
(you
said)
Forever
be
a
hero
in
my
eyes
I
reply
But
there's
always
another
side
to
a
good
father
A
great
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
We
brought
out
the
worst
in
each
other
Someone
had
to
make
the
sparring
end
'Cause
I
loved
you
but
I
hated
that
me
And
I
don't
wanna
see
that
side
again
But
I'm
sorry
Kim
More
than
you
could
ever
comprehend
Leaving
you
was
fucking
harder
than
Sawing
off
a
fucking
body
limb
Once
upon
a
time
where
all
we
had
Maybe
that
was
what
drew
us
to
each
other
It
was
true
love
shit
that
we
never
knew
was
possible
We
might
have
loved
each
other
too
much
And
maybe
that's
what
made
us
do
what
we
did
to
each
other
All
the
screw-ups
'Cause
you
always
thought
that
you
was
more
in
love
with
me
And
I
was
thinking
I
was
more
in
love
than
you
was
For
all
the
times
that
we
thought
it
was
'Til
we
saw
how
wrong
we
were
When
the
dust
settles
now
and
all
the
dirt
And
if
I
touch
the
rawest
nerve
all
I
want
is
for
us
not
to
hurt
And
it's
been
an
exhaustive
search
to
find
the
words
But
I
just
heard
"Mockingbird"
And
got
the
urge
to
jot
me
some
verses
and
thoughts
The
purpose
was
not
to
stir
up
open
wounds
I've
caused
got
a
few,
and
so
have
you
Or
argue
who's
fault
it
was,
partly
yours,
partly
mine
But
really
no
ones,
this
is
so
tough
I'm
getting
choked
up
Oh
fuck
it,
we
both
suck
We
broke
up,
got
back
together
We
both
thought
we
had
forever
Not
bad
people,
just
bad
together
We
was
so
nuts,
backstab
each
other
Another
blow
struck,
but
there's
no
ducking
this
blow
'Cause
it's
over,
and
it's
closure
But,
I'm
not
so
sure
how
to
close
this,
I
just
don't
know
How
some
people
can
be
so
good
At
one
thing
and
so
fucked
at
a
whole
'nother
shit
It's
no
wonder
How
come
you
can
be
a
lord
and
a
loser
How
come,
how
come,
you
can
be
a
liar
and
a
good
father?
A
good
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
Why
are
you
a
good
father?
A
great
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
(dad)
(you
said)
Forever
be
a
hero
in
my
eyes
I
reply
But
there's
always
another
side
to
a
good
father
A
great
dad,
but
a
bad
husband
I'm
stumbling,
I
can't
see
straight
And
it's
my
fault
I
got
this
way
I
got
my
hands
on
something
great
And
found
a
way
to
mess
it
all
up
I
did
my
best,
I
tried
to
change
But
it's
just
in
my
DNA
I
got
my
hands
on
something
great
And
found
a
way
to
fuck
it
up
again
Now
I'm
the
one
thing
You
couldn't
hate
more
But
you're
the
one
thing
That
I
would
die
for
All
my
life,
I
was
told,
I
was
never
nothing
special
I
don't
need
to
be
reminded
of
it
every
other
second
'Specially
when
all
my
self-esteem's
already
shot
the
hell
up
Falling
helplessly,
I'm
embarrased,
I
don't
want
no
one
else
to
see
'Cause
I
feel
like
I'm
a
piece
of
shit,
every
time
she
yells
at
me
Selfishly
indeed,
but
definitely
doesn't
help
that
she
Makes
me
feel
like
I've
died
and
gone
to
heaven,
but
makes
life
a
living
hell
for
me
She
does
that
thing
with
her
lip,
now
she's
melting
me
I'm
putty
in
her
palms,
I'm
wrapped
around
her
finger
A
yo-yo
on
a
string,
she
lets
me
sit
there
and
just
dangle
Until
something
better
comes
along,
and
she'll
just
drop
me
like
a
hot
potato
I
look
like
I'm
in
pain,
but
I'm
okay,
though
'Cause
I
know
she
loves
me,
my
friends,
what
do
they
know?
It's
like
I'm
drowning
at
sea
Hoping
that
you
reach
for
me
I
know
you're
there
but
I
can't
see
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
I'm
dying
to
breathe
And
all
you
do
is
strangle
me
Such
a
beautiful
relief
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
Drunk
off
tragic
endings
In
my
moments
of
weakness,
I
openly
admit
this
shit,
I
wouldn't
normally
I'm
extremely
self-conscious
and
enormously
Insecure
and
she
uses
it
to
torture
when
she
torments
me
It
only
turns
to
ammunition
for
her
in
this
war
when
she
Gets
going,
she
don't
stop,
when
I'm
up,
she's
like
a
downer
When
I
found
her
it
was
love
at
first
encounter
Plus,
somehow,
she
must've
took
the
carton
of
eggs
off
the
counter
Cracked
them
and
placed
all
the
shells
on
the
ground
for
me
to
walk
on
when
I'm
around
her
But
there's
just
something
'bout
her
That
makes
me
not
able
to
function
without
her
How
can
I
get
out
of
it
when
I
don't
know
how
to?
I'm
a
doubter,
I'm
a
pessimist
Make
a
believer
out
of
me
And
show
me
the
way
now
Or
stay
the
fuck
out
of
my
cloud
of
rain
'Cause
I'm
going
straight
down
the
drain
I'm
drowning
It's
like
I'm
drowning
at
sea
Hoping
that
you
reach
for
me
I
know
you're
there
but
I
can't
see
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
I'm
dying
to
breathe
And
all
you
do
is
strangle
me
Such
a
beautiful
relief
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
Drunk
off
tragic
endings
Now
I'm
the
one
thing
You
couldn't
hate
more
But
you're
the
one
thing
That
I
would
die
for
It
took
a
while
for
me
to
get
it,
but
I
think
I've
figured
it
out
She
don't
want
me,
she
just
don't
wanna
see
me
with
someone
else
The
idea
of
seeing
me
happy
destroys
her
in
itself
To
see
me
falling
to
pieces
brings
her
joy,
brings
her
hell
But
it
annoys
her
to
see
me
get
this
straight,
then
say
"screw
her"
I
threw
up
on
myself,
I'm
dumb
sick,
I'm
addicted
to
her
She's
tryna
block
the
door,
so
here's
how
I
do
her
Since
I'm
manure,
she's
a
sewer
This
time,
this
piece
of
shit's
running
through
her
I
can
see
that
right
now,
I'm
running
to
it
What
the
fuck?
Shoulda
knew
it
Who
would
think
she'd
actually
have
the
balls
to
do
it?
As
soon
as
I
hopped
in
it,
she
gassed
the
car
with
lighter
fluid
She's
standing
there
with
a
rag,
'bout
to
put
the
lighter
to
it
Lit
the
fucking
thing
on
fire,
then
she
threw
it
It's
like
I'm
drowning
at
sea
Hoping
that
you
reach
for
me
I
know
you're
there
but
I
can't
see
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
I'm
dying
to
breathe
And
all
you
do
is
strangle
me
Such
a
beautiful
relief
'Cause
I'm
so
drunk
off
tragic
endings
Drunk
off
tragic
endings
Feeling
kinky,
lip
syncing
to
Too
$hort's
Freaky
Tales
(Biatch!)
Having
creepy
visions
of
whiskey
drinking
Envisioning
sneaking
into
where
Christie
Brinkley
dwells
I
know
this
is
risky
thinking
but
I
wanna
stick
her
like
she
decals
But
when
murdering
females
better
pay
attention
to
these
details
Or
you
could
be
derailed,
better
wear
atleast
three
layers
Of
clothing
or
be
in
jail
If
you
get
scratched
because
your
DNA'll
Be
all
up
under
her
fingernails
Man
he
hears
you
I
don't
think
he
cares
He
gives
a
fuck
even
his
pinky
swears
Three
personalities
burstin
out
of
me
please
beware
Her
TV
blares,
can't
hear
the
creaking
stairs
She's
all
aware
in
no
underwear
she's
completely
bare
Turns
around
and
screams
I
remember
distinctly
I
said
"I'm
here
to
do
sink
repairs."
Chop
her
up
put
her
body
parts
in
front
of
Steven
Avery's
trailer
And
leave
'em
there
But
hey
man
I
was
framed
I
know
what
this
looks
like
officers
please
just
give
me
one
minute
I
think
I
can
explain
I
ain't
murder
nobody
I
know
these
words
are
so
nutty
But
I'm
just
here
to
entertain
How
come
your
shirt
is
so
bloody?
There's
a
missing
person,
so
what
he's
got
nothing
to
do
with
me
I'm
almost
certain
I
was
framed
Woke
up
it
was
dawn,
must
a
knew
something
was
wrong
Think
I'm
becoming
a
monster
'cause
of
the
drugs
that
I'm
on
Donald
Duck's
on
as
the
Tonka
Truck
in
the
yard
But
dog
how
the
fuck
is
Ivanka
Trump
in
the
trunk
of
my
car
Gotta
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
to
try
to
solve
it
Must
go
above
and
beyond,
'cause
it's
incumbent
upon
Me,
'cause
I
feel
somewhat
responsible
for
the
dumb
little
blonde
girl
That
motherfuckin'
baton
twirler
that
got
dumped
in
the
pond
Second
murder
with
no
recollection
of
it
Collecting
newspaper
articles,
cutting
up
sections
from
it
Memories
to
fuck
to
remember
destructive
temper
cut
my
public
defender's
jugular
Then
stuck
him
up
in
the
blender
Another
dismembered
toddler
Discovered
this
winter
probably
'Cause
the
disassembled
body
Was
covered
up
in
the
snow
since
the
month
of
November
oddly
I'm
going
in
for
questioning
Them
son
of
a
bitches
probably
just
wanna
pin
this
on
me
But
hey
man
I
was
framed
I
know
what
this
looks
like
officers
please
just
give
me
one
minute
I
think
I
can
explain
I
murdered
nobody
I
know
these
words
are
so
nutty
But
I'm
just
here
to
entertain
How
come
your
shirt
is
so
bloody?
There's
a
missing
person,
so
what
he's
got
nothing
to
do
with
me
I'm
almost
certain
I
was
framed
Still
on
the
loose
day
Spotted
me
inside
McDonald's,
Tuesday
In
a
Toronto
Blue
Jays
cap
looking
like
your
college
roommate
With
Rihanna,
Lupe,
Saddam
Hussein,
Bobby
Boucher
Or
was
it
Cool
J
the
cops
is
on
a
goose
chase
Just
escaped
from
the
state
pen
for
raping
eight
women
who
hate
men
Don't
make
it
no
weirder
I'm
naked
when
I
break
in
your
basement
Under
your
babies
play
pen
I
lay
and
wait
adjacent
facing
the
door
remaining
patient
While
staying
complacent
blatant
Sexual
implications
are
continuing
to
get
thrown
Insinuations
are
placed
in
little
riddles
and
poems
Left
on
your
pillow
in
hopes
that
when
you
get
home
You'll
get
the
hint
ho,
I'm
in
your
window
But
it
never
occurred
to
me
I
could
describe
a
murder
scene
In
a
verse
and
be
charged
with
first
degree
Cause
it
just
happened
to
match
up
perfectly
With
the
massacre
or
the
Burger
King
burglary
No
officer
you
see
I
was
framed
I
know
what
this
looks
like
officers
please
just
give
me
one
minute
I
think
I
explain
I
murdered
nobody
I
know
these
words
are
so
nutty
But
I'm
just
here
to
entertain
How
come
your
shirt
is
so
bloody?
There's
a
misssing
person,
so
what
he's
got
nothing
to
do
with
me
I'm
almost
certain
I
was
framed
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
world's
on
fire
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
we're
never
getting
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
you're
told
We're
going
nowhere
fast
I
feel
sorry
for
this
beat
Sympathy
pains
for
this
track
This
road
is
taking
me
back
Down
memory
lane
with
this
rap
I
can
still
look
out
in
this
crowd
Be
wowed
and
be
taken
aback
I'm
simply
stating
a
fact
I
had
Wembley
Stadium
packed
But
now
we're
on
a
path
headed
to
nowhere
and,
fast
Another
terrorist
attack,
like
a
tariff
grows
Half
of
Madison
Square
up,
alas
We
perish
in
the
blast
but
that
doesn't
scare
us
We
pass
no
one,
we're
fearless
'Cause
we're
just
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
world's
on
fire
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
we're
never
getting
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
you're
told
We're
going
nowhere
fast
'Cause
we're
going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
nowhere
Going
nowhere
fast
Fuck
doing
what
you're
told,
act
like
a
two-year
old
Shit
is
soon
to
go
kaboom
and
blow
anyways
For
MC's
it's
a
funeral
when
I'm
devising
this
rhyme
'Cause
I'm
awake
and
you're
mourning
That's
why
I
rise
and
I
shine
Like
a
new
day
has
dawned
on
me
Gusto
guts
bravado
nuts
and
plus
I
kick
up
dust
and
cuss
a
lot
I
musta
got
you
in
somewhat
of
a
debacle
'Cause
some
stuff
that's
awful
really
don't
mean
nothing
all
though
There's
a
lot
of
shit
I
said
in
jest
that's
tough
to
swallow
But
if
at
times
my
heart
it
seems
like
it's
in
the
wrong
place
It's
probably
cause
it's
on
my
sleeve
Keanu
Reeves
speed
of
life
Avoid
or
veer
or
just
steer
toward
it
We're
only
looking
forward
but
Where
we're
going,
we
have
no
idea
Nowhere
to
go
but
hysterical
It's
getting
warm
in
here,
I
set
the
world
on
fire
Was
born
to
be
an
arsonist
Just
one
spark
and
it's
lit
But
I'ma
still
get
dark
on
this
shit
Told
you
I'd
leave
my
mark
on
this
bitch
War
machine
but
you've
forced
me
in
a
corner
I'm
sure
to
have
something
for
your
ear
And
in
the
course
of
the
assault
is
torture,
it's
more
severe
Go
to
war
with
me
or
end
up
blew
to
Timbuktu
I
send
at
you
a
ten
ton
nuke
like
Kim
Jong-Un
And
end
up
blewn
in
your
career
All
in
all,
it's
said
and
done
And
at
the
end
of
my
run,
I
just
rewind
clocks
Forever
young,
make
time
stop
Will
I
ever
fall
off,
that
day'll
never
come
To
the
Pine
box,
bitch
fuck
you
I'm
better
than
I
ever
was
'Til
the
bomb
drops,
hope
it
never
does
but
I'm
not
gonna
sweat
it
'cause
this
World's
screwed,
it's
already
fucked
and
I'm
on
top
So
everyone's
just
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
world's
on
fire
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
we're
never
getting
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
you're
told
We're
going
nowhere
fast
'Cause
we're
going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
nowhere
Going
nowhere
fast
You
can't
tell
us
nothing
Hard-headed
and
we're
stubborn
So,
one
ear
and
out
the
other
we're
young
Who
knows
what
the
future
for
us
could
hold
Another
shooter,
uh
oh
no
more
tomorrow's
we're
done
And
all
we
are
is
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
world's
on
fire
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
we're
never
getting
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
you're
told
We're
going
nowhere
fast
'Cause
we're
going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
nowhere
Going
nowhere
fast
Wanna
take
it
from
the
top?
Lady
you
remind
me
of
my
raps
on
that
Relapse
shit
Cause
you
got
an
ass
thick
as
them
accents
Two
ass
cheek
implants,
call
that
an
asset
Cause
you
could
set
a
glass
on
it,
it's
massive
From
the
first
time
I
saw
you
I
actually
said
to
myself,
"I
gotta
meet
her
like
a
taxi"
Exactly,
love
affair
in
the
backseat
Sorry
if
I'm
being
graphic,
but
I'm
stiff
as
a
statue
You
sat
on
a
shelf,
I
feel
like
I'm
a
bust
Maybe
I'm
just
ahead
of
myself
Let
me
slow
down,
slow
your
Camaro
I'm
tryna
catch
up,
I'm
tryna'
jump
your
bones
to
the
marrow
Got
me
under
your
control
and
your
spell
Wanna
wrap
you
up,
put
you
in
a
bow
like
an
arrow
Grab
you
by
the
(meow),
hope
it's
not
a
problem
in
fact
About
the
only
thing
I
agree
on
with
Donald
is
that
So
when
I
put
this
palm
on
your
cat
Don't
snap,
it's
supposed
to
be
grabbed
Why
do
you
think
they
call
it
a
snatch
I
just
wanna
climb
in
the
sack
I'ma
keep
it
100,
like
my
speedometer's
at
I'm
watching
you
rap,
I'm
the
dude
following
in
back
About
six
cars
back,
I'm
in
the
lac
And
I
want
to
(uh)
All
day,
all
day,
all
night
You
ask,
I
stay
the
night
With
you,
you
say
you're
vile
Me
too,
you're
burning
up
I'm
running
All
day,
all
night
You
feel,
my
heat
(fire,
fire,
fire,
fire)
Feel,
feel,
feel,
feel,
feel,
my
heat
Hate
to
inconvenience
you
at
the
convenience
store
But
them
jeans
you
wore,
like
I've
never
seen
before
I
pretend
to
work
there,
while
I
clean
the
floor
Checking
you
out,
like
the
clerk,
while
he
rings
you
up
Pull
up
behind
you
while
you're
leaving
and
you
don't
even
know
it
(ayo,
Rick,
man)
She's
brushing
her
hair,
adjusting
her
mirror
She's
rapping
my
shit,
but
she
wasn't
aware
I
was
there,
or
maybe
she
was,
and
just
didn't
care
Who
knows,
at
least
that
isn't
up
in
the
air
It's
something
to
see
So
like
a
chick
who
thinks
her
coochie
doesn't
stink
If
she
ain't
planning
to
do
shit,
this
summers
eve
Maybe
she
wants
to
keep
me
company
But
fuck
the
Pepe
Le
Pew
shit
"Ain't
stepping
to
you
bitch",
I
say
to
myself
Plus
she's
bumping
my
music,
and
chasing
no
tail
Like
a
skunk
in
heat
I
could
sweat
her,
to
some
degree
But
fuck
it,
I'm
the
male,
let
her
come
to
me
Let
her
come
to
me,
male
sweater,
some
degree,
fail
Fuck
it,
pull
up
beside
her
Side
swipe
her,
Dodge
Viper
What
is
a
brighter
ass
if
she
wants
a
computer
Lodged
up
her
vagina
Said
my
dick
is
an
Apple
She
said
"put
it
inside
her"
I
said
All
day,
all
day,
all
night
You
ask,
I
stay
the
night
With
you,
you
say
you're
vile
Me
too,
you're
burning
up
I'm
running
All
day,
all
night
You
feel,
my
heat
(fire,
fire,
fire)
Feel,
feel,
feel,
feel,
feel,
my
heat
Black
out,
come
to,
hands
covered
in
blood
Motherfucking
gloves
and
a
shovel
stuck
in
the
mud
I
just
bodied
the
beat,
so
that
hoe
must've
been
dug
Cause
it
just
died
like
"ooh,
food
coloring,
duh"
So
let's
get
turnt,
like
a
shish
kebab,
twist
it
Ma
Like
an
Air
Conditioning
knob
We
be
great
together
Don't
care
if
it
takes
forever
If
I
gotta
wait,
I
guess
it's
better
late
than
never
You
felt
my
heat,
rubbing
off
on
you
I
love
your
personality
Come
on,
little
mama,
you're
hot
enough
to
melt
Rick's
beat
Come
jump
in
the
water,
I
bet
you
get
yourself
a
stream
From
your
persona
With
an
ass
to
match,
girl
your
body
is
lit
You're
striking,
I'm
a
gas
Girl,
you're
just
gonna
have
to
put
the
mother
chumps
on
the
back
burner
You
got
puns,
I
got
asperger's
Decided
to
rest
my
head
in
between
that
set
of
Ds
While
I
shred
MC's,
like
cheddar
cheese
That's
just
the
thoroughbred
in
me,
ain't
a
better
breed
My
dog
thinks
so
too,
look
at
my
pedigree
Ma,
the
world
is
what
I
think
of
you
I
think
you're
divine,
so
I
might
swing
on
you
I'm
just
kidding
girl,
I
wouldn't
lift
a
finger
or
two
Unless
it's
the
middle
one,
to
finger
you
All
day,
all
day,
all
night
You
ask,
I
stay
the
night
With
you,
you
say
you're
vile
Me
too,
you're
burning
up
I'm
running
Feel,
feel,
feel,
feel,
feel,
my
heat
On
the
ones
and
twos,
threes
and
four
in
(the
morning)
Rick's
in
the
cut
like
Neosporin
(what?)
He's
mixing
it
up
for
me
and
Lauren
A
teddy
like
short
for
Theodore
We're
outtie,
five
thousand
"Who
the
fuck,
it's
my
big
dick,
so
everybody
get
ready
right
fucking
now"
You
claim
if
you
get
knocked
by
the
cops
You'll
give
'em
not
even
a
statement
Walk
in
the
arraignment,
shoot
the
bailiff
Karate
kick
the
plaintiff
Gotti
with
the
stainless
I'll
just
call
it
shoddy
entertainment
If
y'all
was
in
the
party
gettin'
faded
On
molly,
had
the
audience
sedated
You
wouldn't
catch
a
body
if
it
fainted
Probably
let
it
fall
and
hit
the
pavement
But
you'd
be
the
first
lobbyin'
to
claim
it
Bitch,
stop
bein'
a
lame
Your
hobby
isn't
robbery
and
dismemberin'
body
limbs
Like
you
was
Tommy
Lynn
Sells
And
chainsawing
them
in
the
basement
Hardly
fits
your
job
description
Ain't
nobody
dippin'
out
the
back
of
the
club
like,
"Oh
my
God,
he's
trippin'"
Only
time
you
get
the
blade
is
probably
with
the
dang
lawn
equipment,
ain't
it?
Wouldn't
take
a
bobby
pin
and
wave
it
I
need
to
stop
bein'
debated
You're
still
copyin',
Xeroxing,
I'm
still
coppin'
a
feel
Like
Bill
Cosby
at
will,
popping
a
pill
then
spill
Oxys
in
Jill's
coffee
Then
send
her
out
to
the
hotel
lobby
a
lil'
wobbly
and
still
groggy
This
blonde
fucks
reprehensible
misconducts,
never
sensible
Kiss
my
butt,
my
set
of
principles
is
gone
But
till
I
get
the
President
to
respond
My
pen
and
pencil
is
a
missile
launcher
And
send
it
to
Mitch
McConnell
Just
as
big
of
a
bitch
as
Donald
Shit's
on,
bruh
Let
me
sing
this
shit
soprano
While
I
do
it
pizzicato
Ivanka,
stiff
arm
her
While
I'm
hittin'
on
Melania
And
this
song's
for
all
ya
'Cause
nobody
likes
me,
everybody
hates
me
They
want
me
to
go
eat
some
worms
I
hope
you
offended
And
drag
my
name
through
the
mud,
through
the
dirt
But
I'ma
make
you
eat
your
words
I
hope
you
offended
You
can
try
to
hold
me
down,
but
you
better
let
me
up
'Cause
you're
only
gonna
make
things
worse
I
hope
you
offended
'Cause
I
swear
when
I
get
up
I'm
never
gonna
let
up
'Til
everybody
eats
my
turds
These
drums
and
hard
snares
bring
out
the
worst
in
me
Like
Justin
Ross
Harris
at
a
nursery
Goin'
ham
at
candy
yam
on
nanny
cam
I'm
gettin'
handys
with
the
zanny
Xannys
in
the
Caddy
armrest
I'm
imagining
objects,
so
I'm
batting
cobwebs
From
a
daddy
longleg
And
Hamtramck,
got
the
panoramic
camera
Xanax,
a
banana
hammock
and
a
Santa
hat
I'm
smellin'
like
a
damn
mechanic
With
a
chick
that
looks
like
Janet
Jackson
with
a
Spanish
accent
Twice
your
age
and
I'm
actin'
half
it
Grow
up?
Nah
Not
that
I
know
of,
y'all
Basement
just
got
a
frickin'
overhaul,
got
a
stripper
pole
installed
Started
rollin'
all
through
those
Kolonopins
like
a
bowlin'
ball
Like
an
overdose
on
twice
the
ratio
of
Propofol
and
go
through
no
withdrawal
While
I
get
fellatio
and
give
a
facial
to
an
interracial
blow-up
doll
of
Rachel
Dolezal
You're
so
appalled
(Em),
so's
my
manager
Bitch
I'm
amateur,
fuck
a
pro
career
Coast
is
clear,
but
nowhere
to
go
from
here
And
nobody's
close,
so
don't
compare
They
ain't
nowhere
near,
I'm
way
over
here
My
competition
can't
see
me
'Cause
I
don't
own
a
mirror
But
Marshall,
you
are
terrific,
so
smart
and
gifted
I'm
so
narcissistic,
when
I
fart,
I
sniff
it
Do
a
fake
dab
to
smell
my
armpits
with
it
Your
anxiety's
throwin'
gang
signs
But
I
made
strides
with
these
rape
lines
I'm
cuttin'
back
on
women
hate
crimes
Like
Ray
Rice
when
he
FaceTimes
Bang,
bang,
bang,
bang
time
Dang
knives
to
butcher
them
gay
wives
You're
gonna
need
sutures
the
same
size
As
the
blade
I
push
into
captcha
Pull
'em
like...
sleigh
rides
Gotta
stab
a
bitch
at
least
eight
times
To
make
it
on
Dateline
I
came
to
stake
my
claim
like
a
canine
Waitin'
in
a
buffet
line
So
Kellyanne
Conway,
I'm
a
really
bad
hombre
Come
play,
belly
dance
on
me
I've
been
making
wedding
plans
all
day
'Cause
nobody
likes
me,
everybody
hates
me
They
want
me
to
go
eat
some
worms
I
hope
you
offended
And
drag
my
name
through
the
mud,
through
the
dirt
But
I'ma
make
you
eat
your
words
I
hope
you
offended
You
can
try
to
hold
me
down,
but
you
better
let
me
up
'Cause
you're
only
gonna
make
things
worse
I
hope
you
offended
'Cause
I
swear
when
I
get
up
I'm
never
gonna
let
up
'Til
everybody
eats
my
turds
Eight
year
old
with
the
wordplay
Girl,
take
this
pole
like
a
survey
Today
wasn't
my
birthday
But
I'm
caked
up
like
a
dessert
tray
So
we're
in
shape
'Cause
you're
in
a
slurrin'
state
I'm
a
ten,
you're
an
eight,
like
what
I
do
before,
after,
and
during
rape
You
wanna
get
into
a
pissin'
contest
and
find
out
who's
better?
And
they
made
a
fool
out
of
what
I
pulled
out
him
R.
Kelly
with
a
full
bladder
Not
in
high
school,
grad,
I'm
not
a
scholar
But
I'm
so
cold
that
I'm
droppin'
out
with
my
degrees
It's
the
same
as
I
got
in
college
(Zero)
But
nobody's
hotter,
you
owe
me
my
respect
I
owe
you
nada
like
lodi
partner
that
blow
me
Told
you
I'm
so
dirty,
homie
you
can
throw
me
in
some
holy
water
With
some
floaties
on
And
get
the
soap,
and
try
to
get
the
Pope
to
hold
me
While
you
hose
me
off
And
nope
I
won't
be
washed
You
hope
to
God
I
don't
explode,
I
gotta
blow
this
spot
up,
though
I
got
a
lotta
more
I
won't
put
the
sugar
coating
on
it
though
'Cause
sometimes
you
can
feel
like
your
energy's
expired
Rap's
got
you
drained,
dead
tired,
zapped
You
feel
like
a
wet
pile
of
crap
But
look,
man,
like
the
feds
buggin'
my
phone,
uh
huh
I
get
why
you're
tapped
But
you
gotta
get
your
fire
back
Catch
fire,
get
upset
and
fire
back
Is
what
I
tell
myself
When
times
get
bad
'Cause
sometimes
I
might
get
sad
Well
I
take
the
same
advice
I
had
And
tell
myself
like
I
used
to
tell
Hailie,
when
life's
a
drag
Told
her
to
do
like
her
dad,
don't
cry,
get
mad
'Cause
little
baby
powders
belong
in
diaper
bags
I'm
hyper,
by
the
time
you
see
this
side
of
me
I'm
right
in
your
ass
'Fore
the
pen,
I
stood
up
for
the
kid
who
had
to
put
up
with
the
bullies
at
his
school
(at
his
school)
You
ain't
have
to
have
no
money
or
go
shoppin'
just
to
cop
a
fuckin'
attitude
Now
my
dough's
amountin'
to
a
mountain,
it's
rised
too
high
to
count
it
Never
asked
to
be
rich,
all
I
did
was
wish
I
had
a
dime
for
every
time
that
I
was
doubted
But
then
I
think
about
it
and
I'm
enraged
'Cause
I
just
figured
out
that
if
I
was
paid
For
the
time
I
spent
to
put
the
pen
to
the
page
It'd
be
minimum
wage
But
it's
embedded
in
my
head
and
I
never
hunted
for
the
bread
and
butter
What
I
wanted
was
to
be
the
one
that
they
was
scared
of
But
I'm
never
gonna
get
the
credit
for
the
sweat
and
blood
I
put
up
in
the
pen
And
when
I'm
dead
I
wonder
will
they
put
me
on
a
pedestal
Or
forget
I
was
ever
this
incredible
I
guess
I
better
go
harder
than
ever
'cause
I'll
never
get
Another
mothafuckin'
opportunity
again
To
offend
as
many
people
with
this
I
can,
simply
because
I
can
'Cause
nobody
likes
me,
everybody
hates
me
They
want
me
to
go
eat
some
worms
I
hope
you
offended
And
drag
my
name
through
the
mud,
through
the
dirt
But
I'ma
make
you
eat
your
words
I
hope
you
offended
You
can
try
to
hold
me
down,
but
you
better
let
me
up
'Cause
you're
only
gonna
make
things
worse
I
hope
you
offended
'Cause
I
swear
when
I
get
up
I'm
never
gonna
let
up
'Til
everybody
eats
my
turds
You're
drunk,
the
coffee
is
burned
I
hate
to
find
you
like
this
I
always
find
you
like
this
I
come
home
and
clean
up
your
mess
What
would
you
do
without
that?
Why
do
I
always
come
back?
Oh,
what
I
wouldn't
do
for
you
And
I'm
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
And
I'm
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Some
nights
I
want
to
run
for
the
hills
It's
never
easy
with
you
I
cannot
reason
with
you
But
your
smile
is
as
rare
as
it
comes
What
would
I
do
without
that
Maybe
that's
why
I
come
back
Oh,
what
I
wouldn't
do
for
you
And
I'm
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
And
I'm
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Starting
to
think
we
were
made
for
each
other
But
one
of
us
in
this
relationship
is
raising
the
other
You
remind
me
of
my
mother
We
drive
one
another
as
crazy
as
each
other
And
we're
both
adults
so
there's
no
excuse
for
the
games
that
we
play
with
each
other
Where
you
at?
At
a
friends?
No
you
ain't,
motherfucker
But
I
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
Whenever
the
doubt
kicks
in,
shiver
When
I
touch
her,
'cause
I
love
her
so
much,
I'm
a
sucker
Our
bottom
lip
can
quiver
when
she's
in
trouble,
she's
in
hot
water
Think
I
caught
her
cheating
again
Give
her
another
chance?
Another
one
after
that?
I'm
swimming
in
that
Egyptian
River
cause
I'm
in
denial
Say
I
don't
eat
shit,
but
I
got
a
shit-eating
grin
when
I
smile
Making
an
excuse
for
us
to
act
it
out
She's
just
acting
out,
with
her
inner
child
Then
I
set
the
truth
on
fire
Cause
I'd
rather
believe
a
lie
then
breathe
a
sigh
of
relieve
that
I
don't
believe
in
Going
to
bed
mad
I
keep
on
trying
to
make
a
bad
girl
good
But
haven't
I
stood
by
you
in
good
times?
And
bad?
I'm
starting
to
feel
like
you're
god
damn
dead
'Cause
I
literally
feel
like
you
could
die
of
a
"should
I?"
Leave
me
for
good?
You
never
would
Never
understood
why
they
call
it
goodbye
But
I
think
I'm
a
pretty
damn
good
guy
And
you're
a
good
person,
too
I
can
save
you,
I
can
make
you
change
But
I
keep
putting
my
fuckin
foot
in
my
mouth
Every
time
I
gotta
come
to
bail
you
out
When
you
get
in
trouble
that
you
get
yourself
in
I
miss
trouble
but
I
can't
leave
I'll
sell
you
out!
I
could
never
turn
my
fuckin'
back
on
you
What
is
that?
I'm
co-dependant,
I'm
just
now
noticing
it
But
somehow
it's
like
every
time
I
go
to
end
it
I
don't
have
the
cahoney's
to
do
it
Nor
the
heart,
uh,
department
store
You're
using
my
heart
for
a
dart
board
But
God
must've
had
a
non-stop
score
'Cause
somebody
paired
us
up
But
people
say
he
ain't
capable
of
making
a
mistake
But
this
one's
perfect
'Cause
I'm...
And
I'm
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
And
I'm
starting
to
think
maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
Maybe
you
need
me
In
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie
What's
in
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie,
oh
I'm
backing
up
my
shit
Smoke
shit
in
the
cars
I
can
fit
and
I'm
just
driving
as
far
as
I
can
get
Away
from
these
problems,
to
all
my
sorrows
I
forget
What's
tomorrow
like?
'Cause
tonight
I'm
starting
life
again
Kids
in
the
corner
won't
stop
fucking
my
ignoring
Besides
psycho
when
I
fantasize
Starting
my
whole
life
over,
yeah
right
Oh
and
I
might
go
and
Get
hypnotized
so
I
don't
even
recognize
no
one
I
try
to
look
alive
because
there's
nothing
like
Holding
your
head
up
high
when
you're
dead
inside
And
I
just
hide
so
in,
case
you're
wondering
why
my
insides
showing
'Cause
I
done
spilled
all
my
guts
and
know
some
minds
so
I'm
Picking
them
up
and
stuff
them
in
the
back
Fuck
it
I've
done
enough
in
this
rap
shit,
Recovery>
brought
me
nothing
But
back,
to
where
I
was
and
perhaps,
this
could've
been
my
victory
lap
if
I
wasn't
on
the
verge
of
Relapse
In
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie
What's
in
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie,
oh
It
seems
to
be
the
reoccurring
main
thing
The
shit
I
would
daydream
as
a
kid,
I
was
eighteen
I
went
from
an
irate
teenager
to
still
raging
Is
it
though
amazing,
back
then
I
put
eight
thing
Into
the
rhyme,
whether
it
was
sad,
mad,
happy,
or
angry
I
spit
it,
the
mainstream,
I
hit
it
Blame
me,
I
did
itdid
what?Hailie
Baby,
I
didn't
mean
to
make
you
eighty
Percent,
of
what
I
rapped
about
Maybe,
I
should've
did
a
better
job
at
separating
Shady,
and
entertaining,
for
real
life,
but
this
Dang
thing,
is
still
the
hardest
thing
to
explain
Is
the
crazy,
or
should
I?
Ever
seen
it
back
then,
it
was
like
I
ain't
even
Bother
to
taken
into
consideration
You
and
[?]
baby
and
older
and
make,
hear
me
say
things
I
did
it,
pay
me,
and
be,
it
just
ain't
me
Okay,
so
ladies
and
gentlemen
[?]
berate
everything
Is
the
main
reason
that
I,
feel
like
a
lame
piece
of
shit
Or
should
I
start
cranking
in
bitter
Come
playing
beef
and
pick
up
by
the
same
things
'Cause
when
I,
look
at
me,
I
don't
see
what
they
see
I
feel
the
same
greedy
and
lately
I've
been
contemplating
Escaping
to
get
a
ranger
or
whatever
this
road
takes
me
It's
making
me
crazy,
what's
in
my?
In
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie
What's
in
your
head,
in
your
head
Zombie,
zombie,
zombie-ie-ie,
oh
I
built
this
castle,
now
we
are
trapped
on
the
throne
I'm
sorry,
we're
alone
I
wrote
my
chapter
You'll
turn
the
page
when
I'm
gone
I
hope
you'll
sing
along
This
is
your
song
I
just
want
you
to
know
that
I
ain't
scared
Whatever
it
takes
to
raise
you,
I'm
prepared
To
do
whatever,
to
do
whatever
December
1st,
1995,
dear
Hailie
This
is
your
song
You'll
be
coming
out
of
mommy's
stomach
soon
I
better
do
something
quick
if
I'ma
be
able
to
support
you
I
can
barely
support
me,
but
as
long
as
you're
healthy
That's
all
that
matters
for
the
time
being
But
obviously,
assuming
you
will
be,
just
thinking
ahead
I'ma
make
it
if
it
kills
me
Let's
see
how
far
I
can
take
it
with
this
music
I'm
getting
sick
of
chasing
this
illusion
Sorry
for
sloppy
writing
The
pen
in
my
hand's
shaking,
please
excuse
me
Dad's
a
little
nervous,
but
at
the
same
time
excited
If
I
use
this
same
energy
while
I'm
saying
rhymes
and
write
'em
With
the
same
passion
and
the
same
exact
enthusiasm
As
I'm
using
in
this
letter
maybe
they
can
feel
me
as
I'm
Trying
to
build
these
castles
out
of
sand,
baby
girl
For
you
to
sit
on
the
throne,
I
got
plans,
baby
girl
Welcome
to
mom
and
dad's
crazy
world
Love,
daddy
Maple
flavored
kisses,
buttered
pancakes,
and
syrup
I
built
this
castle,
now
we
are
trapped
on
the
throne
I'm
sorry,
we're
alone
I
wrote
my
chapter
You'll
turn
the
page
when
I'm
gone
I
hope
you'll
sing
along
This
is
your
song
I
just
want
you
to
know
that
I
ain't
scared
Whatever
it
takes
to
raise
you,
I'm
prepared
To
do
whatever,
to
do
whatever
December
1st,
1996,
dear
Hailie
You
got
your
momma's
personality,
same
eyes
as
I
got
Her
beautiful
smile,
but
your
ears
are
the
same
size
as
mine
are
Sorry
for
that,
a
little
minor
mishap
But
you'll
grow
into
'em
baby
I'm
on
the
grind
now
I'm
doing
little
shows,
open
mics,
all-nighters
and
studios
While
I'm
tryna
keep
the
lights
on
Why
does
it
seem
like
I'm
so
close
to
this
dream,
yet
so
far?
I
just
keep
steering
I'm
gonna
turn
into
someone
I
haven't
the
slightest
clue
what
I'm
gonna
do
if
it
falls
through
You
took
your
first
steps
today,
you'll
probably
walk
soon
My
Infinite
CD
flopped,
too
many
soft
tunes
They're
talking
bad
about
dad,
it's
ticking
me
off
too
Makes
me
feel
like
I
don't
belong
or
something,
ooh
I
think
I
might
have
just
stumbled
onto
something
new
Got
a
prediction
for
the
future,
I'm
hoping
it's
you
Open
this
envelope
when
you're
older
and
it
holds
true
I
built
this
castle,
now
we
are
trapped
on
the
throne
I'm
sorry,
we're
alone
I
wrote
my
chapter
You'll
turn
the
page
when
I'm
gone
I
hope
you'll
sing
along
This
is
your
song
I
just
want
you
to
know
that
I
ain't
scared
Whatever
it
takes
to
raise
you,
I'm
prepared
To
do
whatever,
to
do
whatever
December
24th,
2007,
dear
Hailie
Now
if
you
found
these
letters,
I
guess
I
better
try
to
explain
A
lot's
happened
in
between
'em,
since
I
rised
to
this
fame
I've
said
your
name
but
always
tried
to
hide
your
face
This
game
is
crazy,
I
wanted
to
claim
my
love
for
you
but
damn
I
never
knew
it'd
be
like
this
If
I
did
I
wouldn't
have
done
it
You
ain't
asked
for
none
of
this
shit
Now
you're
being
punished?
Things
that
should've
been
private
with
me
and
your
mother
is
public
I
can't
stomach,
they
can
take
this
fame
back,
I
don't
want
it
I'll
put
out
this
last
album
then
I'm
done
with
it
One-hundred
percent
finished
Fed
up
with
it,
I'm
hanging
it
up,
fuck
it
Excuse
the
cursing,
baby,
but
just
know
That
I'm
a
good
person,
though
they
portray
me
as
cold
And,
if
things
should
worsen,
don't
take
this
letter
I
wrote
as
a
goodbye
note
'Cause
your
dad's
at
the
end
of
his
rope
I'm
sliding
down
a
slippery
slope
Anyways
sweetie,
I
better
go,
I'm
getting
sleepy
Love
dad
Shit,
I
don't
know
If
I
could
rewind
time
like
a
tape,
inside
a
boombox
One
day
for
every
pill,
or
percocet
that
I
ate
Cut
down
on
the
valium,
that'll
hurt
everything
But
death
is
turning
so
definite,
wait
They
got
me
all
hooked
up
to
some
machine
I
love
you,
being,
didn't
want
you
to
know
I
was
struggling
Feels
like
I'm
underwater
submerged
like
a
submarine
Just
heard
that
nurse
say,
my
liver
and
kidneys
aren't
functioning
Been
flirtatious
with
death,
skirt-chasing,
I
guess
It's
arrivederci,
same
nurse,
just
heard
say
they're
unplugging
me
And
it's
your
birthday,
Jade,
I'm
missing
your
birthday
Baby
girl,
I'm
sorry,
I
fucking
hate
when
you
hurt,
Hai
And
sweeties,
thank
you
for
waiting
to
open
gifts
But,
girls,
you
can
just
open
'em,
dad
ain't
making
it
home
for
Christmas
Wish
I
had
the
strength
to
just
blow
a
kiss
I
go
to
make
a
fist,
but
I
can't
make
one,
I'm
frozen
stiff
I
yell,
but
nothing
comes
out,
I'm
crying
inside,
I
shout
My
vocal
cords
won't
permit
me,
I
scream,
but
it's
not
allowed
You
put
your
arm
around
mama,
the
karma,
wow
I
just
thought
about
the
aisle,
I'll
never
get
to
walk
us
down
Never
see
you,
graduate
in
your
caps
and
gowns
It's
'bout
to
be
2008,
how's
this
happening
now?
I've
got
so
much
more
to
do,
and
Proof,
I'm
truly
sorry
If
I
let
you
down,
but
this
tore
me
in
two
The
thought
of
no
more
me
and
you
You
gave
me
shoes,
Nikes
like
new
for
me
for
school
Doody,
I'm
trying,
but
you,
you
were
the
glue
that
binded
So
many
things,
time,
I'd
give
anything
to
rewind
it
I
had
to
walk
down
my
halls
and
constantly
be
reminded
By
pictures
all
on
my
walls
and
I
couldn't
sleep
at
night
'cause
That
image
burned
in
my
brain
of
you
on
the
table
Me
falling
across
your
body,
not
able
to
stand
to
save
you
God,
why
did
you
take
him?
I'm
tryna
keep
his
legacy
alive,
but
I'm
dying,
where's
Nathan?
Little
ladies,
be
brave,
take
care
of
your
mother
Smile
pretty
for
pictures,
always
cherish
each
other
I'll
always
love
ya,
and
I'll
be
in
the
back
of
your
memory
And
I
know
you'll
never
forget
me,
just
don't
get
sad
when
remembering
And,
little
bro,
keep
making
me
proud
You
better
marry
that
girl
'cause
she's
faithfully
down
And
when
you're
exchanging
those
sacred
vows,
just
know
that
if
I
could
be
there
I
would
and
should
you
ever
see
parenthood,
I
know
you'll
be
good
at
it
Oh,
almost
forgot
to
do
something,
thank
my
father
too
I
actually
learnt
a
lot
from
you,
you
taught
me
what
not
to
do
And
Mom,
wish
I'd
have
had
the
chance
To
have
one
last
heart-to-heart
honest
and
open
talk
to
you
Doody,
I
see
you,
I
go
to
walk
to
you
And
I
can
feel
my
soul
leave
my
body
and
float
across
the
room
Nurses
lean
over
the
bed,
pulling
tubes
out
Then
the
sheet
over
my
head,
shut
the
room
down
Girls,
please
don't
get
upset,
I
see
them
cheeks
soaking
and
wet
As
you
squeeze
hold
of
my
neck,
so
forcibly,
don't
wanna
let
Me
go,
pillow
drenched,
emotional
wrecks
With
every
second,
each
closer
to
death
But
suddenly,
I
feel
my
heart
begin
to
beat
slow
Then
a
breath,
machines
go
(*beep
beep
beep*)
Must've
guessed
the
cheat
codes
to
this
shit
I'm
tryna
rewind
time
like
a
tape,
find
an
escape
Make
a
beeline,
try
and
awake
From
this
dream,
I
need
to
re-find
My
inner
strength,
to
remind
me
Even
if
a
steep
climb
I
must
take
To
rewrite
a
mistake,
I'm
rewinding
the
tape
(I
don't
want
it)
I'll
put
out
this
last
album,
then
I'm
done
with
it
One
hundred
percent
finished,
fed
up
with
it
I'm
hanging
it
up,
fuck
it
Excuse
the
cursing,
baby,
but
just
know
That
I'm
a
good
person,
though
they
portray
me
as
cold
And
if
things
should
worsen,
but
I
bet
you
they
won't
I'm
pledging
to
throw
this
methadone
in
the
toilet
Shred
these
old
letters
I
wrote
All
that
old
pathetic
loathing,
closing
credits
can
roll
I'm
proud
to
be
back,
I'm
'bout
to,
like
a
rematch
Outdo
Relapse
With
Recovery,
Mathers
LP2
Help
propel
me
to
victory
laps
Gas
toward
them
and
fast
forward
the
past
Consider
the
last
four
minutes
as
The
song
I'd
have
sang
to
my
daughters
If
I'd
have
made
it
to
the
hospital
Less
than
two
hours
later,
but
I
fought
it
Came
back
like
a
boomerang
on
'em
Now
a
new
day
is
dawning,
I'm
up,
Tuesday,
it's
morning
Now
I
know
Yeah,
yo'
I’m
just
gonna
write
down
my
first
thoughts
and
see
where
this
takes
me,
'cause
I
feel
like
I
wanna
punch
the
world
in
the
fuckin'
face
right
now
Yeah,
let
me
explain
just
how
to
make
greatness
Straight
out
the
gate,
I’m
'bout
to
break
you
down
Ain't
no
mistakes
allowed,
but
make
no
mistake
I'm
'bout
To
rape
the
alphabet,
I
may
raise
some
brows
If
I
press
the
issue
just
to
get
the
anger
out
(brrr)
Full
magazine
could
take
Staples
out
Savage,
but
ain't
thinkin'
'bout
no
bank
account
But
bitch
I’m
off
the
chain
like
Kala
Brown
Motherfucker,
shut
the
fuck
up
when
I’m
talkin',
lil’
bitch
I'm
sorry,
wait,
what's
your
talent?
Oh,
critiquin'
My
talent?
Oh,
bitch,
I
don’t
know
who
the
fuck
y'all
are
To
give
a
sub-par
bar,
even
have
an
opinion
of
you
You
mention
me,
millions
of
views,
attention
in
news
I
mention
you,
lose-lose
for
me,
win-win
for
you
Billions
of
views,
your
ten
cents
are
two
Skim
through
the
music
to
give
shit
reviews
To
get
clicks,
but
bitch,
you
just
lit
the
fuse
Don't
get
misconstrued,
business
as
us'
Shit-list
renewed
so
get
shit
to
do
Or
get
dissed
'cause
I
just
don't
get
what
the
fuck
half
the
shit
is
that
you're
listenin'
t-to
Do
you
have
any
idea
how
much
I
hate
this
choppy
flow
Everyone
copies
though?
Probably
no
Get
this
fuckin'
audio
out
my
Audi
yo,
adios
I
can
see
why
people
like
Lil
Yachty,
but
not
me
though
Not
even
dissin',
it
just
ain't
for
me
All
I
am
simply
is
just
an
emcee
Maybe
"Stan"
just
isn't
your
cup
of
tea
Maybe
your
cup's
full
of
syrup
and
lean
Maybe
I
need
to
stir
up
shit
Preferably
shake
the
world
up
if
it
were
up
to
me
Paul
wants
me
to
chill,
y'all
want
me
to
ill
I
should
eat
a
pill,
probably
I
will
Old
me
kill
the
new
me,
watch
him
bleed
to
death
I
breathe
on
the
mirror,
I
don't
see
my
breath
Possibly
I'm
dead,
I
must
be
possessed
Like
an
evil
spell,
I'm
E-V-I-L
(evil,
but
spelled)
Jam
a
Crest
Whitestrip
in
the
tip
of
my
dick
with
an
ice
pick
Stick
it
in
a
vice
grip,
hang
it
on
a
spike
fence
Bang
it
with
a
pipe
wrench
While
I
take
my
ballsack
and
flick
it
like
a
light
switch
Like
vice-president
Mike
Pence
Back
up
on
my
shit
in
a
sidekick
as
I
lay
it
on
a
spike
strip
These
are
things
that
I'd
rather
do
than
hear
you
on
a
mic
Since
nine-tenths
of
your
rhyme
is
about
ice
and
Jesus
Christ
man,
how
many
times
is
someone
gonna
fuck
on
my
bitch?
(Fuck
my
side
chick!)
You
will
never
see
Em
icy,
but
as
cold
as
I
get
on
the
M-I-C
I
polarize
shit
so
the
Thames
might
freeze
And
your
skull
might
split
like
I
bashed
you
upside
it
Bitch
I
got
the
club
on
smash
like
a
nightstick
(yeah)
Turn
down
for
what?
I
ain't
loud
enough
Nah,
turn
the
valium
up!
'Cause
I
don't
know
how
I'm
gonna
get
your
mouths
to
shut
Now
when
it
doesn't
matter
what
caliber
I
spit
at
I'll
bet
a
hundred
thousand
bucks
You'll
turn
around
and
just
be
like,
"Man,
how
the
fuck
sourpuss
gonna
get
mad
just
'cause
his
album
sucks?
And
now
he
wants
to
take
it
out
on
us."
(ooh-ooh)
But
last
week,
an
ex-fan
mailed
me
a
copy
Of
The
Mathers
LP
to
tell
me
to
study
It'll
help
me
get
back
to
myself
and
she'll
love
me
(ooh-ooh)
I
mailed
the
bitch
back
and
said
if
I
did
that
I'd
just
be
like
everyone
else
in
the
fucking
industry
Especially
an
effing
Recovery
clone
of
me
So
finger-bang,
chicken
wang,
MGK,
Iggy
‘zae
Lil
Pump,
Lil
Xan
imitate
Lil
Wayne
I
should
aim
at
everybody
in
the
game,
pick
a
name
I'm
fed
up
with
being
humble
And
rumor
is
I'm
hungry,
I'm
sure
you
heard
bumblings
I
heard
you
wanna
rumble
like
an
empty
stomach
I
heard
your
mumblin'
but
it's
jumbled
in
mumbo-jumbo
The
era
that
I'm
from
will
pummel
you
That's
what
it's
comin'
to
What
the
fuck
are
you
gonna
do?
Where
you
runnin'
to?
I'm
gonna
crumble
you
and
I'll
take
a
number
two
And
dump
on
you
if
you
ain't
Joyner
If
you
ain't
Kendrick
or
Cole
or
Sean
then
you're
a
goner
I'm
'bout
to
bring
it
to
anyone
in
this
bitch
who
want
it
I
guess
when
you
walk
into
BK
you
expect
a
Whopper
You
can
order
a
Quarter
Pounder
when
you
go
to
McDonald's
But
if
you're
lookin'
to
get
a
porterhouse
you
better
go
get
Revival
But
y'all
are
acting
like
I
tried
to
serve
you
up
a
slider
Maybe
the
vocals
should
have
been
auto-tuned
And
you
would
have
bought
it
But
sayin'
I
no
longer
got
it
'Cause
you
missed
the
line
and
never
caught
it
'Cause
it
went
over
your
head,
because
you're
too
stupid
to
get
it
'Cause
you're
mentally
retarded,
but
pretend
to
be
the
smartest
With
your
expertise
and
knowledge,
but
you'll
never
be
an
artist
And
I'm
harder
on
myself
than
you
could
ever
be
regardless
What
I'll
never
be
is
flawless,
all
I'll
ever
be
is
honest
Even
when
I'm
gone
they're
gonna
say
I
brought
it
Even
when
I
hit
my
forties
like
a
fuckin'
alcoholic
With
a
bottle
full
of
malt
liquor
But
I
couldn't
bottle
this
shit
any
longer
The
fact
that
I
know
that
I'ma
hit
my
bottom
If
I
don't
pull
myself
from
the
jaws
of
defeat
and
rise
to
my
feet
I
don't
see
why
y'all
even
started
with
me
I
get
impeached,
my
enemies
die
I
don't
ceasefire
'til
at
least
all
are
deceased
I'm
eastside,
never
be
caught
slippin'
Now
you
see
why
I
don't
sleep
Not
even
a
wink,
I
don't
blink
I
don't
doze
off,
I
don't
even
nod
to
the
beats
I
don't
even
close
my
fuckin'
eyes
when
I
sneeze
"Aw,
man!
That
BET
cypher
was
weak,
it
was
garbage
The
Thing
ain't
even
orange—oh
my
God,
that's
a
reach!"
Shout
to
all
my
colorblind
people,
each
and
every
one
of
y'all
If
you
call
a
fire
engine
green,
aquamarine
Or
you
think
water
is
pink
"Dawg,
that's
a
date,"
"Looks
like
an
olive
to
me."
"Look,
there's
an
apple!"
"No
it's
not,
it's
a
peach!"
So
finger-bang,
Pootie
Tang
Burger
King,
Gucci
Gang,
dookie,
dang
Charlamagne
gonna
hate
anyway
Doesn't
matter
what
I
say
Give
me
Donkey
of
the
Day
What
a
way
for
2018
to
get
underway
But
I'm
gonna
say
everything
that
I
wanna
say
Welcome
to
the
slaughterhouse,
bitch!
(yeah)
Invite
them
in
like
a
One
A
Day
I'm
not
done
(preach)
'Cause
I
feel
like
the
beast
of
burden
That
line
in
the
sand,
was
it
even
worth
it?
'Cause
the
way
I
see
people
turnin'
Is
makin'
it
seem
worthless
It's
startin'
to
defeat
the
purpose
I'm
watchin'
my
fan
base
shrink
to
thirds
And
I
was
just
tryin'
to
do
the
right
thing,
but
word
Has
the
court
of
public
opinion
reached
a
verdict
Or
still
yet
to
be
determined?
'Cause
I'm
determined
to
be
me,
critique
the
worship
But
if
I
could
go
back
I'd
at
least
reword
it
And
say
I
empathize
with
the
people
this
evil
serpent
Sold
the
dream
to
that
he's
deserted
But
I
think
it's
workin'
These
verses
are
makin'
him
a
wee
bit
nervous
And
he's
too
scurred
to
answer
me
with
words
'Cause
he
knows
that
he
will
lyrically
get
murdered
But
I
know
at
least
he's
heard
it
'Cause
Agent
Orange
just
sent
the
Secret
Service
To
meet
in
person
to
see
if
I
really
think
of
hurtin'
him
Or
ask
if
I'm
linked
to
terrorists
I
said,
"Only
when
it
comes
to
ink
and
lyricists."
But
my
beef
is
more
media
journalists
(Hold
up,
hold
up,
hold
up…)
I
said
my
beef
is
more
meaty,
a
journalist
Can
get
a
mouthful
of
flesh
And
yes,
I
mean
eating
a
penis
'Cause
they
been
pannin'
my
album
to
death
So
I
been
givin'
the
media
fingers
Don't
wanna
turn
this
to
a
counselling
sesh
But
they
been
puttin'
me
through
the
ringer
So
I
ain't
ironin'
shit
out
with
the
press
But
I
just
took
this
beat
to
the
cleaners
Motherfuckers
talkin'
crazy
(yeah),
sayin’
I
should
quit
(yeah)
I
fuckin'
tell
them
make
me
(bitch),
eat
a
fuckin'
dick
(yeah)
I’m
feelin'
like
the
greatest
(woo),
wanna
be
whoever
did
it
Mike
Will
the
one
who
made
it,
it's
Shady
on
the
lyrics
I'm
somewhat
outlandish
they
say
You
say
we're
cut
from
the
same
cloth
But
I
guess
you
fabricate,
eh?
You
better
bring
more
men
than
the
Latter
Day
Saints
Manic
states,
Stephen
Paddock
with
automatic
stay
spray
At
anything
that
may
stand
in
their
way
As
I
stand
at
the
bay
window
with
a
hand
grenade
And
a
tre
eight,
at
the
Mandalay
Bay
Common
sense,
I'm
a
dollar
short
and
a
day
late
James
Holmes
at
the
Saturday
Batman
matinee
Must
have
missed
my
cat-scan
that
day
I
just
threw
a
Tampax
at
Dre
Trashcan,
Tascam
and
ashtray
I'm
turning
back
to
a
madman,
can't
take
Anymore
but
I
try
to
get
away
from
the
anger
and
rage
My
basic
alias
is
an
A
to
the
K
Get
your
ass
spayed
like
bidets
breakin’
your
legs
Ain’t
givin'
ways
ankle
the
ways
you
chumps
don’t
Even
know
how
to
do
somethin'
To
give
goosebumps
a
day
when
you
say
That
somethin'
you
won't
give
someone
a
lump
in
their
throat
If
you
had
them
choked
up
you’d
be
yankin'
my
chain
Feelin'
like
I'm
headed
for
a
padded
cell,
the
Bar
for
me
what
I
rap
isn't
fair
but
Guess
that's
the
standard
I'm
held
to
But
if
somethin'
like
that
doesn't
tell
ya
You
set
a
mark
too
high
when
platinum
sales
are
looked
at
as
a
failure,
then
you
better
take
it
back
to
the
shelter
And
Hamburger
Helper,
'cause
damn
it
I'm
still
the—
Greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world
No
lie,
I
might
be
The
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it
I
feel
like
the
greatest
Woke
up
to
to
honkies
sounding
like
me
Never
be
as
good,
never
be
as
good
Packing
up
wife-beaters,
white
t-shirts,
white
But
I'm
the
greatest
So
you
sold
10
million
albums,
eh?
(What?)
Only
problem
is,
you
put
out
10
million
albums,
eh?
(Haha)
Wait,
what
was
I
just
about
to
say?
Oh
yeah,
let
me
get
this
out
the
way
I
know
there's
people
that
are
pissed
about
the
way
I
misprounouced
a
name:
"DIE
ANTWOORD!"
Fuck,
I
still
can't
say
the
shit
But
how
quickly
they
forget
who
the
fuck
I
was
Now
Ninja
try
to
duck
my
slugs
to
let
ya
girl
get
fucked
by
Muggs
I'd
like
to
give
a
shout
to
Cypress
This
can't
be
real,
you
dissed
me
and
I
was
just
tryin'
to
Give
you
a
shout—now
get
the
fuck
out
my
rhyme
book!
No
more
shiners,
already
too
much
time
tokin'
rappers
I
hear
you
talkin'
shit,
I'm
just
too
big
to
respond
to
it
God
forbid
I
forget,
go
and
jump
out
the
window
Somebody
better
child-proof
it
'Cause
if
I
lose
it
we
can
rewind
to
some
old
Ja
Rule
shit
And
I
can
remind
motherfuckers
I'll
do
shit
You
don't
got
the
tools,
I
got
my
toolkit,
I
bullshit
you
not
Y'all
fools
just
forgot
that
I'm
so
fuckin'
awful
with
the
thoughts
And
when
I'm
hostile
and
impossible
to
stop
So
you
call
it
a
nostril
'cause
it's
not…
gonna
ever
I'll
never
let
up
on
the
pedal,
might
as
well
get
the
mop
'Cause
I'm
wipin'
everyone
up
in
this
genre
'Cause
on
the
mic
I
feel
like
I'm
the—
Greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world
No
lie,
I
might
be
The
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever

it
I
feel
like
the

Woke

Never

never

Packing

white
t-shirts,
white
But
I'm
the
greatest
Oh
yeah
and
one
more
thing
I
want
to
mention
Is
you're
one
dimension
I'm
a
monkey
wrench
and
I
can
flunk
detention
I
love
contentions
so
welcome
to
the
gun
convention
Muscles
flexin',
gotta
strut
like
a
front
suspension
And
you
just
stuck
the
key
up
in
the
ignition
And
gave
me
enough
gas
to
flood
my
engine
(yeah)
Psychopath,
Michael's
Jack's
blowin'
up
like
a
raft
I
just
slapped
Vlad
with
a
ISIS
flag
Bet
you
I
come
back
twice
as
bad
(uh)
Revival
didn't
go
viral!
Denaun
and
Royce
tell
me
that
I
should
take
the
high
road
Fuck
that,
I'm
finna
hit
back
'Til
I
run
out
of
gun
powder
and
split
the
scene
Hold
the
mic
similar
to
pistol,
squeeze
And
I
shoot
from
the
hip
when
I
grip
them
things
And
my
lips
and
the
clips
got
the
SIG
lit
like
it's
nicotine
Trigger
me
and
Slim
gets
mean
Bars
are
like
bullets
when
I
spit
them
schemes
That's
why
I
call
the
motherfuckers
M-16's
Float
like
a
butterfly,
I'm
'onna
sting
like
a
bee,
you
ain't
harmin'
a
thing
I
get
a
day
hard
as
I'm
gonna
swing
I'm
gonna
need
to
put
my
arm
in
a
sling
But
like
a
wedding
band
you
gotta
be
diamond
to
even
climb
in
the
ring
An
anomaly,
I'm
Muhammad
Ali
'Cause
I
know
one
day
I'm
gonna
be
the—
Greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world,
greatest
in
the
world
No
lie,
I
might
be
The
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it,
the
best
to
ever
do
it
I
feel
like
the
greatest
Woke
up
to
to
honkies
sounding
like
me
Never
be
as
good,
never
be
as
good
Packing
up
wife-beaters,
white
t-shirts,
white
But
I'm
the
greatest
Woah,
Joyner,
Joyner,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
Yeah,
I
done
did
a
lot
of
things
in
my
day,
I
admit
it
I
don't
take
back
what
I
say,
if
I
said
it
then
I
meant
it
All
my
life
I
want
a
Grammy
but
I'll
prolly
never
get
it
I
ain't
never
had
no
trophy
or
no
motherfuckin'
ribbon
Fuck
the
system,
I'm
that
nigga,
bend
the
law,
cut
the
rules
I'm
about
to
risk
it
all,
I
ain't
got
too
much
to
lose
Y'all
been
eatin'
long
enough,
it's
my
turn
to
cut
the
food
Pass
the
plate!
Where
my
drink?
This
my
day,
lucky
you
Fuck
you
too,
woah!
Y'all
gotta
move,
y'all
gotta
move,
y'all
gotta
move
Give
me
some
room,
give
me
some
room,
give
me
the
juice
Hop
out
the
coupe,
hop
out
the
coupe,
how
'bout
I
shoot?
Y'all
gotta
move,
y'all
gotta
move,
give
me
the
juice
Back
on
my
bullshit,
my
back
to
the
wall
Turn
my
back
on
you
all
and
you're
finished
Back
to
these
bullets,
it's
back
to
the
job
Pull
my
MAC
out
and
all
of
you
runnin'
Back
on
my
hood
shit,
it's
back
to
the
pushin'
These
packs
and
I'm
actually
pumpin'
Can't
fuck
with
you
rappers,
you
practically
suckin'
You
might've
went
platinum,
but
that
don't
mean
nothin'
I'm
actually
buzzin'
this
time
Straight
out
the
kitchen,
I
told
them
the
oven
is
mine
I
do
not
fuck
with
you
guys
If
I
don't
care
you
just
know
that
you
gonna
suffer
this
time
I
ain't
no
gangster
but
I
got
some
bangers
Some
chains
and
some
blades
in
and
a
couple
of
knives
Choppers
and
jammies,
a
partridge
in
a
pear
tree
My
twelve
days
of
Christmas
was
nothin'
but
lies
Why
don't
you
holla
like
a
sumo
(sumo)
They
say
I
talk
like
a
chulo
(chulo)
I
live
in
Mars,
I'm
not
Bruno
Bitch
I'm
a
dog,
call
me
Cujo
You
play
your
cards,
I
reverse
on
you
all
And
I
might
just
drop
four
like
an
Uno
Cállate
boca
mejor,
maricón,
little
puto,
and
all
of
you
culo
They've
invented
a
level
off
in
the
ghetto
to
ghetto
Lookin'
for
something
that
prolly
can
never
find
out
Shake
irrelevant
and
tell
'em
to
beef
right
now
What
you
would
nigga?
You
really
want
me
tied
down
I've
been
alone
and
I
never
needed
nobody
Just
only
me
and
my
shotty,
I'll
tell
these
niggas
to
lie
down
Keep
all
of
the
money,
I
never
wanted
the
lifestyle
I
just
pray
to
God
that
my
son'll
be
alright
now
I
said
ain't
no
love
for
the
other
side
Or
anyone
who
ever
want
smoke
(Joyner)
When
I
die
I'm
goin'
out
as
the
underdog
who
never
lost
hope
You
in
the
wrong
cab
down
the
wrong
path
Nigga
wrong
way,
the
wrong
road
Snakes
in
the
grass
tryna
slither
fast
I
just
bought
a
fuckin'
lawn
mower
I
have
said
a
lotta
things
in
my
day,
I
admit
it
This
is
payback
in
a
way,
I
regret
it
that
I
did
it
I
done
won
a
couple
Grammys
but
I
sold
my
soul
to
get
'em
Wasn't
in
it
for
the
trophies,
just
the
fuckin'
recognition
Fuck's
the
difference?
I'm
that
cracker,
bend
the
law,
fuck
the
rules
Man
I
used
to
risk
it
all,
now
I
got
too
much
to
lose
I
been
eatin'
long
enough,
man
my
stomach
should
be
full
I
just
ate,
lick
the
plate,
my
buffet,
lucky
me
Fuck
you
think?
(woo!)
I
got
a
couple
of
mansions
Still
I
don't
have
any
manners
You
got
a
couple
of
ghost
writers
But
to
these
kids
it
don't
actually
matter
They're
askin'
me,
"What
the
fuck
happened
to
hip-hop?"
I
said,
"I
don't
have
any
answers."
'Cause
I
took
an
L
when
I
dropped
my
last
album
It
hurt
me
like
hell
but
I'm
back
on
these
rappers
And
actually
comin'
from
humble
beginnings
I'm
somewhat
uncomfortable
winning
I
wish
I
could
say
"What
a
wonderful
feeling!"
We're
on
the
upswing
like
we're
punchin'
the
ceiling
But
nothin'
is
stealing
like
anyone
has
any
fuckin'
ability
To
even
stick
to
a
subject,
it's
killin'
me,
the
inability
to
pin
humility
Hatata
batata,
why
don't
we
make
a
bunch
of
fuckin'
Songs
about
nothin'
and
mumble!
And
fuck
it,
I'm
goin'
for
the
jugular
Shit
is
a
circus,
you
clowns
that
are
comin'
up
Don't
give
an
ounce
of
a
motherfuck
About
the
ones
that
were
here
before
you
to
make
raps,
it's
recap
Way
back,
MC's
that
recap
and
tape
decks
ADAT's
with
the
G
raps
and
Kane's
hat
We
need
3
stacks
ASAP,
and
bring
Masta
Ace
back
Because
half
of
these
rappers
have
brain
damage
All
the
lean
rappin',
face
tats,
syruped
out
like
tree
sap
I
don't
hate
trap,
and
I
don't
wanna
seem
mad
But
in
fact
with
a
old-me
at
the
same
cat
that
would
take
that
Feedback
and
aim
back,
I
need
that
But
I
think
it's
inevitable
They
all
got
button
to
press
or
a
lever
to
pull
They
give
me
the
snap
though
(lil'
bitch)
And
if
I
paid
attention
I'd
probably
makin'
it
big
But
you've
been
takin'
the
dicks
in
the
fuckin'
back,
ho
(get
it?)
On
the
brink
in
a
minute
Got
me
thinkin'
of
finishin'
everything
With
acetaminophen
then
reapin'
the
benefits
I'ma
sleep
at
the
wheel
again
As
I
peak
into
thinkin'
about
an
evil
intent
Of
another
beat
'em
and
kill
again
'Cause
even
if
I
gotta
end
up
eatin'
a
pill
again
Even
ketamine
or
methamphetamine
with
the
Manidon
It
better
be
at
least
70
to
300
milligram
And
I
might
as
well
'cause
I'ma
end
up
bein'
a
villain
again
Levels
to
this
shit,
I
got
an
elevator
You
could
never
say
to
me
I'm
not
a
fuckin'
record
breaker
I
sound
like
a
broken
record
every
time
I
break
a
record
Nobody
could
ever
take
away
the
legacy,
I
made
a
navigator
Motherfucker
never
got
a
right
to
be
this
way
I
got
spite
inside
my
DNA
But
I
work
'til
the
wheels
fall
off,
I'm
workin'
tirelessly,
ayy
It's
the
moment
y'all
been
waitin'
for
Like
California
wishin'
rain
would
pour
And
that
drought
y'all
have
been
prayin'
for
My
downfall
from
the
8
Mile
to
the
Southpaw
Still
the
same
Marshall
that
outlaw
That
they
say
is
a
writer
might've
fell
off
But
back
on
that
bull
like
the
cowboys
So
y'all
gotta
move
(yeah),
y'all
gotta
move
(yeah),
y'all
gotta
move
Give
me
some
room,
give
me
some
room,
give
me
the
juice
Hop
out
the
coupe,
hop
out
the
coupe,
how
'bout
I
shoot?
Y'all
gotta
move,
y'all
gotta
move,
give
me
the
juice
Hey,
what's
going
on,
this
is
Paul
Rosenberg,
attorney
of
law.
Listen,
I
listened
to
the
rough
copy
of
your
album
And
uh,
you
know
I've
just
got
to
be
honest
with
you
Can
you
tone
it
down
a
little
bit?
Because
there's
only
so
much
I
can
explain.
Give
me
a
call
Yo,
how
do
I
keep
(I
don't
know
what’s
up
with
these
hoes,
man)
Getting
in
relationships
like
this
(I'm
just
sayin')
Maybe
it
says
something
about
me
(Yeah)
Should
I
look
in
the
mirror?
I
just
want
you
to
be
normal
Why
can’t
you
bitches
be
normal?
Always
gotta
be
so
extra
Why
you
always
need
a
lecture?
My
ex
hates
to
talk,
she's
a
texter
Even
when
I'm
in
bed
layin'
right
next
to
her
Wants
to
get
back
together
Said
not
'til
she
gets
her
act
together
She
thinks
I'm
bein'
mean
and
now
She
starts
to
scream
and
shout
She's
about
to
let
the
demons
out
She
don’t
want
to
see
me
with
other
females
out
I
tell
the
bitch
to
beat
it,
take
the
scenic
route
She
retaliates
by
tryin’
to
leave
the
house
In
an
evening
gown
with
her
cleavage
out
We've
been
down
this
road
too
many
times
for
me
to
count
And
all
I
can
think
is
how—
I
just
want
you
to
be
normal
Why
can’t
you
bitches
be
normal?
Always
gotta
be
so
extra
Like
a
fuckin'
terrestrial
Guess
it
comes
with
the
territory
My
ex
girl,
she
just
declared
war
Therefore,
I
better
prepare
for
it
I
guess
bein'
weird's
normal
And
I
don’t
know
what's
got
a
hold
of
me
Most
notably
I've
been
zonin'
to
Jodeci
I'm
totally
open,
hopelessly
devoted
So
much
so
that
I
bet
you
she
don't
know
that
she's
The
first
thing
I
think
of
when
I
wake
up
And
the
last
thing
I
think
of
before
I
go
to
sleep
Sike,
hope
she
don't
notice
me
goin'
through
her
purse
I
know
she
cheats,
so
do
I,
I'm
soulless,
she's
heartless
No
wonder
we're
partners
Both
got
hundreds
of
charges
Domestic
disputes
but
we've
always
Swept
it
under
the
carpet
Even
when
911
gets
the
call
that
I
slipped
up
and
busted
her
jaw
with
A
Louisville
Slugger
'cause
all's
it
Really
does
is
make
our
love
For
each
other
grow
stronger
She
won
me
over
the
second
she
tried
to
run
me
over
Told
her
I'd
keep
it
a
hun'
We
all
but
kicked
her
out,
called
her
back
now
she's
coming
over
But
why
is
she
so
wicked?
And
how
the
fuck
did
I
get
so
twisted?
I'm
with
someone
that's
so
unlikeable
and
shifty
We're
like
nitrogen
and
hydrogen
mixed
with
Ignitable
liquids,
but
I'm
finally
seeing
She's
only
mine
for
the
time
being
That's
why
I
keep
bringin'
up
that
one
time
she
Tried
to
two-time
me
And
throw
it
up
in
her
face
'til
I
dry
heave
How
could
I
be
so
naive?
Should
I
leave
or
turn
this
entire
evening
Into
a
motherfucking
crime
scene?
Maybe
I'm
just
too
ugly
to
compete
with
him
You
weren't
supposed
to
agree,
you
fucking
bitch!
Especially
when
you're
the
one
cheated
first
Now
the
argument
immediately
becomes
heated
You
don't
want
me
to
flip,
little
conceded
cunt
Eat
a
monkey
dick
wrapped
in
a
stuffed
pita
fajita
Slut,
treat
just
like
a
drum,
beat
it
Complete
it,
and
once
you've
succeeded,
repeat
it!
I
love
you
but
I
hope
you
fuckin'
die
though
In
our
business
your
friends
like
to
pry
so
You've
got
'em
all
under
cover
just
like
moles
Hopin'
they'll
come
back
with
intel
But
I'm
the
one
who's
thrown
into
the
spiral
'Cause
now
the
roles
are
reversed
so
here
I
go
Thinkin'
I'm
sly
as
I
scroll
through
your
iPhone
Who
the
fuck's
Milo?
The
guy
at
work
who
drives
a
hi-lo
I
put
a
tracking
device
on
your
Chrysler
And
follow
you
while
you
drive
home
But
like
a
cyclone,
I
just
got
my
disguise
blown
You
recognize
me
and
had
Milo
Flip
me
off
right
out
the
passenger
side
window
I
hit
a
light
pole,
you
skirt
off
And
then
pull
up
at
5am
in
the
drive
in
a
stretch
white
limo
Stumble
in
the
side
door
and
hit
me
head
with
Milo's
demo
But
like
a
drunk
bum,
what
do
I
know?
Let's
sleep
on
it
like
they
did
Revival
I
told
you
you're
the
apple
of
my
eye
so
shut
your
pie
hole
Just
wanna
be
normal
Why
can't
you
be
normal?
Yeah,
I
just
wanna
be
normal
Why
can't
you
be
normal?
Eminem
-
Em
Calls
Paul
(Skit)
Encore
Aye
yo
Paul,
It's
Em
I
got
your
call
about
the
Michael
Jackson
thing
And
I
know
that
he's
not
'thrilled'
about
the
video
What
does
he
'wanna
be
startin'
somethin'?'
Well
I'll
show
him
who's
really
'bad'
Paul,
'the
way
you
make
me
feel'
with
these
calls
You
should
really
take
a
look
at
the
'man
in
the
mirror'
And
tell
him
to
'beat
it'
because
I
'won't
stop
till
I
get
enough'
Do
you
'remember
the
time'
we
were
watching
the
'Billy
Jean'
video?
Well
he'll
always
be
that
Michael
to
me
And
it
doesn't
matter
if
he's
'black
or
white'
Because
I
'can't
stop
loving
him'
and
I
hate
plastic
surgeons
And
I
hope
they
all
fucking
die!
How
do
you
like
that?
And
I
like
him,
I
like
him
a
lot
I
want
to
touch
him
but
I
can't
Excuse
me,
I'm
taking
a
shit
Sorry
Anyways,
call
me
back
I
have
this
idea
about
how
I
want
to
end
the
show
So,
hit
me
when
you
get
this
message
fucker
Oh,
and
by
the
way
No
I
don't
have
a
new
gun
[click]
(goddamn
it)
Take
you
to
the
river
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah
It's
2002,
everything
was
totally
new
We
were
globally
huge,
watchin'
sales
go
through
the
roof
We
wrote
and
we
viewed
it,
Runyon
Avenue
soldiers
included
A
multitude
of
homies
who
would
bounce
for
no
good
excuse
We
were
so
bulletproof—wrote,
souped
and
soaked
in
our
youth
Thought
we
was
runnin'
shit
'til
we
lost
the
sole
of
our
shoe
The
death
of
Doody
broke
us
in
two
We
were
thrown
for
a
loop,
ain't
none
of
us
know
what
to
do
And
at
the
time
I
was
goin'
through
my
own
struggles
too
So
I
wasn't
in
no
condition
to
be
coachin'
us
through
Everyone
tried
to
go
solo,
really
nobody
blew
I
was
hopin'
they
do,
so
I
ain't
have
to
shoulder
the
crew
The
plan
was
put
everyone
in
position
so
that
they
knew
How
to
stand
on
they
own,
and
I
don't
want
to
open
up
wounds
I
just
noticed
that
oomf
was
gone
when
we
go
in
the
booth
'Cause
the
truth
is,
the
moment
that
Proof
died,
so
did
the
group
If
I
could
leave
this
world
behind
I
could
open
up
my
eyes
and
walk
in
a
straight
line
Turn
to
the
river
with
you
Help
me
leave
this
all
behind
I'ma
wash
away
my
sins
I'ma
rinse
away
this
dirt
I
forgot
to
make
amends
To
all
the
friends
I
may
have
hurt
I
better
stop
and
say
my
grace
From
that
I
pray
that
I
don't
fall
'Cause
on
the
way
back
down
I
may
End
up
runnin'
back
into
them
all
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
as
my
stepping
stones
It
was
never
the
same,
and
it's
bothered
me
since
And
the
farther
we
drift
apart,
the
more
awkward
it
gets
The
more
time
goes
by,
the
more
life
happens
And
we
gotta
be
men,
we
got
responsibilities
Plus
we
don't
say
how
we
feel
And
I
feel
like
this
is
what
got
us
in
the
debacle
we're
in
Been
with
you
guys
thick
and
thin
But
it's
almost
as
if
sometimes
we're
not
even
friends
Which
reminded
me
Biz,
"Rockstar"
was
the
shit
Y'all
coulda
got
you
a
hit
without
me
on
the
shit
If
you
woulda
put
D12
on
it,
wish
I
coulda
did
More
than
try
talkin'
you
into
comin'
up
off
of
it
I
know
it
wasn't
my
fault,
but
part
of
it
probably
is
I
think
of
all
of
the
trips
to
BET
And
the
rappers
I
wish
that
we
woulda
politicked
with
Maybe
y'all
coulda
clicked
and
got
you
some
features
But
that's
water
under
the
bridge
But
I'm
washin'
my
sins
in
it
'til
my
conscience
is
cleansed
If
I
could
leave
this
world
behind
I
could
open
up
my
eyes
and
walk
in
a
straight
line
Turn
to
the
river
with
you
Help
me
leave
this
all
behind
I'ma
wash
away
my
sins
I'ma
rinse
away
this
dirt
I
forgot
to
make
amends
To
all
the
friends
I
may
have
hurt
I
better
stop
and
say
my
grace
From
that
I
pray
that
I
don't
fall
'Cause
on
the
way
back
down
I
may
End
up
runnin'
back
into
them
all
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
as
my
stepping
stones
Bacardi
and
Hen',
never
thought
the
party
would
end
One
minute
you're
bodyin'
shit,
but
then
your
audience
splits
You
can
already
sense
the
climate
is
startin'
to
shift
To
these
kids
you
no
longer
exist
Went
from
rainin'
cats
and
dogs
in
this
bitch
To
tiny
drops,
little
drips
And
by
the
time
your
reign
is
over,
you'll
hardly
be
missed
You
start
thinkin'
of
all
the
artists
you
gift,
all
the
carnage
you
left
Is
this
the
kind
of
karma
you
get
For
turnin'
your
fuckin'
back
on
Bizzy,
Kuniva
and
Swift?
A
Freudian
slip,
subconsciously,
I
honestly
wished
I
ain't
feel
so
much
guilt
and
y'all
didn't
harbor
resentment
But
it's
hard
to
pretend
that
y'all
ain't
got
none
I
just
wish
I
had
words
But
I
guess
they're
just
are
none
for
this
To
my
partners,
I
can't
say
how
sorry
I
am
This
is
not
how
I
planned
for
our
story
to
end
I
love
all
of
you,
man
But
I
just
can't
be
the
guy
everybody
depends
On
for
entire
careers
'cause
that's
not
even
fair
I
will
always
be
here,
but
that
spark
isn't
there
And
I
don't
know
how
to
recapture
that
time
and
that
era
I've
tried
hearkening
back
to,
but
I'm
fightin'
for
air
I'm
barely
chartin'
myself
Feels
like
I'm
on
the
descent,
but
it
was
not
my
intent
To
treat
y'all
like
a
stepping
stone
Though
I
ain't
left
no
one
behind,
but
we
been
down
every
road
Done
all
we
possibly
can,
I
know
we
kept
our
hopes
up
But
the
longer
we
spend
livin'
this
lie
that
we
live
The
less
is
left
for
closure,
so
let's
let
this
go
It's
not
goodbye
to
our
friendship,
but
D12
is
over
I'ma
wash
away
my
sins
I'ma
rinse
away
this
dirt
I
forgot
to
make
amends
To
all
the
friends
I
may
have
hurt
I
better
stop
and
say
my
grace
From
that
I
pray
that
I
don't
fall
'Cause
on
the
way
back
down
I
may
End
up
runnin'
back
into
them
all
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
as
my
stepping
stones
I
never
meant
to
make
you
feel
like
my
stepping
stones
I
never
meant
to
use
you
all
for
my
stepping
stones
Tay

We

I

Y'all

I

Flyin'

I
am
not

feelin'
like
the
streets

me
I
ain't
gotta
dance
long
as
my
Ferrari
Spyder
move
like
C
Breezy
I
don't
gotta
hire
goons
I'd
rather
try
to
buy
the
moon
and
breathe
freely
The
sky
is
blue,
the
tie
is
new
The
Maserati
white
and
cool
like
G-Eazy
While
these

How

Find

a
brother

To

and
then
bust
the
shit

When

flush

down
We

not
give

a
fuckin'

Sellin'

Possible

Now

Y'all

toppin'
the

To

the
park
in
a
pile

Knowledge

powerless
If

Y'all

Hirin'

Oh,

streets,
huh?
Now
you
wanna
come
and
fuck
with
me,
huh?
This
little
cock-sucker,
he
must
be
feelin'
himself
He
wants
to
keep
up
his
tough
demeanor
So
he
does
a
feature,
decides
to
team
up
with
Nina
But
next
time
you
don't
gotta
use
Tech
N9ne
If
you
wanna
come
at
me
with
a
sub,
Machine
Gun
And
I'm
talkin'
to
you,
but
you
already
know
who
the
fuck
you
are,
Kelly
I
don't
use
sublims
and
sure
as

don't
sneak-diss
But
keep
commenting
on
my
daughter
Hailie
I
keep
on
telling
motherfuckers
But
just
in
case
you
forgot
really
and
need
y’all
memories
Jarred
like
strawberry
or
pineapple,
apricot
jelly
I
respond
rarely,
but
this
time
Shady
'bout
to
sound
off
Like
a
fuckin'
cocked
semi
Glock,
demi-god
Let
me
put
a
fucking
silencer
on
this
little
non-threatening
blond
fairy
cornball
takin'
shots
at
me
You're
not
ready,
fool,
break
yourself
like
Rocksteady
Crew
Obviously,
I'm
not
gettin'
through
We
can
get
it
poppin'
like
Redenbach,
lettin'
off
like
Remy
Ma
Heavy
artillery,
gotta
deal
harsh
with
a
harsh
child
Pull
a
motherfucking
heart
bigger
than
Bizarre's
belly
Only
time
you'll
ever
say
I
lost
You'll
be
talkin'
'bout
Fetty
Wap,
better
call
Diddy
Just
to
try
to
get
me
off,
and
you
better
hope
I
don't
call
Trick
Trick
Bitch,
this
shit
don't
fly
in
our
city
Punk,
you
don't
disrespect
OGs,
R.I.P.
Prodigy
Sold
Dre
my
soul
and
then
told
him
the
moment
he
signed
me
That
I'll
be
the
most
hated,
though
made
it
So
that
there's
no
shame,
it's
okay
to
own
it
'Cause
life
is
a
bitch,
she's
a
bow-legged
ho
But
now
those
days
are
over
I
Harvey
Weinstein
a
bathrobe
hanging
open
My
code
name
is
groper,
I
role
play
with
lotion
I
fuck
the
whole
world
then
I
throw
away
the
Trojan
Olé
the
hoes
like
with
home-made
explosives
I
blow
eighty
holes
in
you
Don't
make
me
go
in,
I
OJ
the
flows
and
I'm
insult
to
injury,
Rolaids
to
Goldman
I
throws
Dre
a
Motrin,
I
throated
Nicole
As
they
both
there
to
choke
and
my
whole
plate
is
soakin'
I'm
double-edge
sword
it
'cause
one
place
I
poke
and
I
stick
and
I
turn
in
a
rotatin'
motion
Invisible
with
the
pen,
I'm
at
the
pinnacle
of
sick
individuals
Stick
my
dick
and
put
the
tip
in
at
minimal
I'm
fuckin'
these
syllables,
I
let
them
lick
on
my
genitals
I'm
a
fucking
invincible,
indefensible,
despicable,
difficult
prick
A
little
bit
unpredictable,
I
spit
the
formidable
That
you
bitches
are
fuckin'
with,
the
original
I
can
say
that
me
and
Nickel
are
identical,
but
not
us
The
only
thing
we
have
in
common
is
I'm
a
dick
and
you
suck
Otherwise
one
has
nothin'
to
do
with
the
other
None
comes
close
to
skunk,
bug,
soldier
Tongue,
shrub,
shoulder,
one
month
older
Sponge,
mob,
colder,
none,
rug,
hoaster
Lug
nut,
coaster,
lung,
jug
roaster
Young
Thug
poster,
unplugged
toaster
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
(yeah!)
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
(whoa!)
Up
on
this
mic,
when
we're
on
it
(yeah!)
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
(yeah!)
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
(woo!)
That's
how
much
we
have
in
common
We
are
not
alike,
there's
not
alike
us—
(Man,
fuck
this
shit,
let's
go)
Okay,
how
do
I
say
this?
(fack,
fack,
fack)
Last
year
didn't
work
out
so
well
for
me
(fack,
fack,
fack)
(fack
last
year)
2018,
well
(fack,
fack)
Yeah,
I'm
a
fuckin'
kamikaze
crashin'
into
everything
You
beat
me,
Islamic
Nazi,
that
means
there
is
no
such
thing
I've
been
goin'
for
your
jugular
since
Craig
G
Duck
Alert
Wedgie
in
my
underwear,
the
whole
bedsheet
and
the
comforter
Stuck
up
in
my
rectal
crack,
kiss
my
disrespectful
ass
I'll
ride
through
your
cul-de-sac
Window
cracked,
bumpin'
your
reference
tracks
You
collab
on
a
referent
rap,
I
have
never
said
his
raps
Overstayed
my
welcome,
stepped
in
crap
And
ruined
your
welcome
mat
So
spit
that
shit
from
the
heart,
you
didn't
write
like
you
wrote
it
While
I
T-bag
the
microphone
'cause
I
go
nuts
on
it
Like
a
fighter
jet
lined
with
explosives
that'll
strike
any
moment
Headed
right
at
opponents
and
I'm
the
fuckin'
pilot
that
flown
it
I'm
'bout
to—
Smash
into
everyone,
crash
into
everything
Back
and
I've
just
begun,
"FACK"
2017
Fack,
fack
on
everyone
Fack,
fack
on
everyone
Fack,
fack
on
everyone
I'm
a
Kamikaze,
gonna
Smash
into
everyone,
crash
like
an
F-15
Damage
already
done,
y'all
shoulda
let
me
be
Fack,
fack
on
everyone
Fack,
fack
on
everyone
Fack,
fack
on
everyone
I'm
a
Kamikaze,
gonna
I
turned
to
rap
'cause
it
made
me
feel
tough
when
I
wasn't
(wasn't)
From
the
moment
I
heard
rap
was
cussin',
I
was
in
(was
in)
Which
is
why
I
identify
with
the
guy
Who
I
was
invented
by,
Dre's
Frankenstein
Energized
like
a
nine
volt,
ice
cold
Like
Snake
Eyes,
twice
in
a
row
on
a
dice
roll
But
if
the
only
reason
I
blow
is
'cause
I'm
white
though
Why
don't
every
other
white
rapper
sell
what
I
sold?
(ooh)
Kamikaze
pilot,
I
wrote
my
suicide
note
Here
come
the
guys
in
white
coats
tryin'
to
stop
me
'Fore
I
jump
behind
the
controls
and
try
to
fly
into
foes
'Cause
I'm
takin'
y'all
with
me
when
I
go
cyclone
I
don't
think
this
typhoon's
lettin'
up
any
time
soon,
here
I
go
Eyes
closed,
blindfolded,
I'm
'bout
to—
Smash
into
everyone,
crash
into
everything
Back
and
I've
just
begun,
"FACK"
2017
Fack,
fack
on
everyone
Fack,
fack
on
everyone
Fack,
fack
on
everyone
I'm
a
Kamikaze,
gonna
Smash
into
everyone,
crash
like
an
F-15
Damage
already
done,
y'all
should've
let
me
be
Fack,
fack

Fack,
fack

everyone
Fack,
fack
on
everyone
I'm
a
Kamikaze,
gonna
Smash
Kamikaze,
kamikaze
Kamikaze,
kamikaze,
kami-kamikaze
Look
at
what
I've
done
I
heard
your
freestyle
on
Shade
45,
that
shit
was
embarrassing
There
is
no
way
we
ever
hear
that
shit
again,
I
guarantee
That
way
that
shit
was
so
ass
it's
somethin'
we
wouldn't
dare
re-air
The
shit's
embarrassing,
as
me
rear-ending
Tara
Reid
bare
In
my
therapy
chair,
my
dick
is
the
hair
length
of
Cher
Each
nut
is
the
chair
width
of
an
acorn,
stairlift
beware
of
me
Lyrically
I'm
terrible,
better
get
your
lyrics
prepared
Richard
Ramirez
is
here,
serial
killin'
every
beat
there
is
Wait,
wait,
got
the
eeriest
feelin'
Somethin'
evil
is
lurkin',
I'm
no
conspiracy
theorist
But
somethin'
here
is
afoot—oh
yeah,
it's
my
dick
Get
the
measurement
stick
(what?),
twelve
inches
of
wood
Wait,
but
I've
been
goin'
for
your
jugular
since
Craig
G
Duck
Alert
And
I've
come
to
pay
respects
'Cause
if
you
sleep
you're
fucked:
other
words,
you
get
laid
to
rest
And
I
hope
your
butt
is
hurt
Put
me
on
a
track,
I
go
cray
on
it
like
a
color
book
You
got
some
views,
but
you're
still
below
me
Mine
are
higher,
so
when
you
compare
our
views,
you
get
overlooked
And
I
don't
say
the
hook
unless
I
wrote
the
hook
And
now
I'm
just
freestylin'
in
the
vocal
booth
And
you
know
I've
always
spoke
the
truth
You
lyin'
through
your
teeth
so
much
you
broke
a
tooth
And
it
ain't
somethin'
I
need
a
phone
to
do
When
I
say
I
can't
wait
'til
I
get
ahold
of
you
And
I
don't
know
what
I'm
s'posed
to
do
Line
up
the
rappers,
take
my
pic
like
a
photo
shoot
You
know,
everybody's
been
tellin'
me
what
they
think
about
me
for
the
last
few
months
It's
too
loud
Maybe
it's
time
I
tell
'em
what
I
think
about
them
Can't
hear
it
coming
down
the
hallway
stairs
from
the
parking
lot
It's
too
loud
Freeze
my
crown
all
up
in
it
Slow
fire
Don't
fall
on
my
face
Don't
fall
on
my
faith,
oh
Don't
fall
on
my
fate
Don't
fall
on
my
faith,
oh
Don't
fall
on
my
fate
Don't
fall
on
my
Gotta
concentrate
against
the
clock
I
race
Got
no
time
to
waste,
I'm
already
late,
I
got
a
marathoner's
pace
Went
from
addict
to
a
workaholic,
word
to
Dr.
Dre
in
that
first
marijuana
tape
Guess
I
got
a
chronic
case
And
I
ain't
just
blowin'
smoke,
'less
it's
in
your
mama's
face
I
know
this
time
Paul
and
Dre,
they
won't
tell
me
what
not
to
say
And
though
me
and
my
party
days
have
all
pretty
much
parted
ways
You'd
swear
to
God
I've
forgot
I'm
the
guy
that
made
"Not
Afraid"
One
last
time
for
Charlemagne
If
my
response
is
late,
it's
just
how
long
it
takes
To
hit
my
fuckin'
radar,
I'm
so
far
away
These
rappers
are
like
Hunger
Games
One
minute,
they're
mocking
Jay
Next
minute,
they
get
they
style
from
Migos,
then
they
copy
Drake
Maybe
I
just
don't
know
when
to
turn
around
and
walk
away
But
all
the
hate
I
call
it
"Walk
on
Water"
gate
I've
had
as
much
as
I
can
tolerate
I'm
sick
and
tired
of
waitin',
I
done
lost
my
patience
I
can
take
all
of
you
motherfuckers
on
at
once
You
want
it,
Shady?
You
got
it!
Don't
fall
on
my
face
Yeah
Don't
fall
on
my
faith,
oh
Don't
fall
on
my
fate
Light
him
up!
Don't
fall
on
my
faith,
oh
Rrr
Don't
fall
on
my
fate
Look
Somebody
tell
Budden
before
I
snap,
he
better
fasten
it
Or
have
his
body
baggage
zipped
The
closest
thing
he's
had
to
hits
is
smacking
bitches
And
don't
make
me
have
to
give
it
back
to
Akademiks
Say
this
shit
is
trash
again,
I'll
have
you
twisted
like
you
had
it
when
you
thought
you
had
me
slippin'
at
the
telly
Even
when
I'm
gettin'
brain,
you'll
never
catch
me
with
a
thot
Lacking
with
it,
"he
ain't
spit
like
this
in
his
last
shit"
Hoe,
you
better
go
back
and
listen
You
know
me
better,
thinkin'
I'll
slow
up,
let
up
Call
it
traps
'cause
it's
a
total
setup
Hopin'
that
you
rappers
fall
in
that
Dre
said,
"Hold
your
head
up"
Kathy
Griffin
stackin'
ammunition,
slap
the
clip
and
cock
it
back
on
competition,
this
is
how
I
shot
a
head
(pew)
Gabby
Giffords,
my
attack
is
viscous,
jack
the
ripper,
back
in
business
Tyler
create
nothing,
I
see
why
you
called
yourself
a
faggot,
bitch
It's
not
just
'cause
you
lack
attention
It's
'cause
you
worship
D12's
balls,
you're
sacrilegious
If
you're
gonna
critique
me,
you
better
at
least
be
as
good
or
better
Get
Earl,
the
Hooded
Sweater,
whatever
his
name
is
to
help
you
put
together
some
words,
more
than
two
letters
The
fans
waited
for
this
moment
Like
the
feature
when
I
stole
this
show
Sorry
if
I
took
forever
Don't
fall
on
my
face
Yeah
Don't
fall
on
my
faith,
oh
I
won't
Don't
fall
on
my
fate
Light
him
up!
Don't
fall
on
my
faith,
oh
Ha
Don't
fall
on
my
fate
It's
too
easy
Just
remember–I
was
here
before
you
And
I'll
be
here
after
you
make
your
run-in
for
you
Detract
this,
I
might
have
to
fuck
Pitchfork
with
a
corkscrew
Just
what
the
doctor
ordered
Revenge
is
the
best
medicine
Increase
the
dose,
unleash
the
monster
Then
tell
the
Grammys
to
go
and
fuck
themselves,
they
suck
the
blood
from
all
the
biggest
artists
like
some
leeches
So
they
nominate
'em,
get
'em
there,
get
a
name
to
'em
See
the
show,
every
parasite
needs
a
host
Then
give
Album
of
the
Year
to
somebody
that
no
one's
ever
even
heard
of
All
I
know
is
I
wrote
every
single
word
of
everything
I
ever
murdered
Time
to
separate
the
sheep
from
goats
And
I
got
no
faith
in
your
writers,
I
don't
believe
in
ghosts
When
rap
needed
it
most,
I
was
that
wing
in
the
prayer
A
beacon
of
hope,
the
B-I-R-D
in
the
air
Somewhere,
some
kid
is
bumping
this
while
he
lip-syncs
in
the
mirror
That's
who
I'm
doin'
it
for,
the
rest
I
don't
really
even
care
But
you
would
think
I'm
carryin'
a
Oxford
dictionary
in
my
pocket
how
I'm
buryin'
these
artists
On
the
scale
it
turns
to
minus
Mines
is
various
as
hardly
and
what's
scary
is
you
prolly
can
compare
me
to
your
car
'cause
I'm
barely
gettin'
started
And
as
far
as
Lord
Jamar,
you
better
leave
me
the
hell
alone
Or
I'll
show
you
an
Elvis
clone
Walk
up
in
this
house
you
own
Brush
my
pelvic
bone
You
should
tell
a
phone
and
go
fetch
me
the
remote
Put
my
feet
up
and
just
make
myself
at
home
I
belong
here,
clown!
Don't
tell
me
'bout
the
culture
I
inspire
the
Hopsins,
the
Logics,
the
Coles,
the
Seans,
the
K-Dots,
the
5'9"s,
and
oh
Brought
the
world
50
Cent,
you
did
squat,
pissed
and
moaned,
but
I'm
not
gonna
fall...
bitch!
It's
too
loud
Can't
hear
it
coming
down
the
hallway
stairs
from
the
parking
lot
It's
too
loud
Freeze
my
crown
all
up
in
it
Slow
fire
You're
such
a
nice
guy,
a
nice
guy
You're
faithful,
you
don't
lie
After
the
club,
you
go
back
home,
right?
Right?
Sike
Suck
my
dick,
you
fuckin'
suck,
man
Suck
my
dick,
you
fuckin'
suck,
man
I
hope
that
your
heart
get
hit
by
a
semi-truck
Suck
my
dick,
you
fuckin'
suck,
man
I
hop
in
your
whip
and
take
a
sip,
then
I
gun
it
I
don't,
I
don't
got
much
self-control,
I
hope
that
you
run
it
I'm
bipolar
with
the
switch
up
just
as
quick
like
you
cummin'
I
don't,
I
don't
got
much
self-control,
I
hope
that
you
run
it
I'm
not
a
cheater,
but
if
I'ma
be
accused,
might
as
well
be
You
tell
me
you'll
take
me
back
when
hell
freezes,
but
females
be
Rushin'
me
outside
my
telly,
temptation
overwhelms
me
Like
my
monthly
bill
from
Sprint,
they
chargin'
me
for
a
selfie
Chargin'
me,
so
I
gave
my
hotel
key
Eh,
I
was
tryna
be
nice
You're
such
a
nice
guy,
a
nice
guy
You're
faithful,
you
don't
lie
After
the
club,
you
go
back
home,
right?
Right?
Sike
Suck
my
dick,
you
fuckin'
suck,
bitch
Suck

dick,

I
hope
that
your
heart

hit
by
a
semi-truck
Suck

dick,
you
fuckin'
suck,
bitch
I
play
your
music
while
you
suffer
like
I'm
Carmichael
Polar
You
tied
up
in
the
basement
while
I
chill
on
your
sofa
La
próxima
yo
sé
que
mejor
me
quedo
sola
Estas
de
buenas
que
yo
ya
vendí
mi
pistola
I'm
an
emotional
wreck,
weak
(uh-huh),
everything
over-affects
me
(yeah)
When
you
joke
it
upsets
me
(yeah),
you
say
I'm
no
good
at
sex
And
you
think
I'm
gross
and
unsexy
(uh-huh)
I
need
Scope
'cause
my
breath
stinks
(yep)
You
hope
I
choke
on
a
Pepsi
(yep)
Bitch,
you
was
supposed
to
correct
me!
(oh)
Been
textin'
you
since
three,
I
still
get
no
fucking
reply
You
say
you
sleep
alone,
but
yet
your
mattress
is
king
size
Fuck
you
goin'
in
those
knee-high
boots?
Cut
it
out,
bitch
I
doubt
that
you're
goin'
to
house
sit
In
that
outfit,
no
skin-tight
Levi's
Every
word
that
comes
out
your
mouth's
a
fucking
lie
Oh,
it's
spring
time,
time
for
you
to
have
a
fling
like
a
slingshot
You
say,
"Don't
come
over"
'cause
you
got
pink
eye
But
I
think
I
got
just
the
thing,
why
Don't
I
bring
my
fuckin'
bat
and
just
swing
by?
Here
we
go,
a
get
in,
from
heroes
to
villains
Used
to
be
your
Romeo,
but
we
were
both
were
jilted
A
couple
of
times,
so
we
had
a
slippery
slope
to
deal
with
But
still
it
gave
me
hope
That
we'll
get
through
it
together,
a
severed
earlobe
Mailed
to
you
in
an
E-N-V-E
lope
Would
be
dope,
but
What
kind
of
lengths
can
you
go?
Pull
a
Vincent
Van
Gogh,
just
to
convince
a
damn
ho
To
be
a
housewife
who
outright
lies
She's
blackout
drunk,
now
she's
backin'
out
my
drive
I
ran
outside,
why's
she
tryna
act
out?
She's
just
about
my
size
Hit
me
in
the
mouth
twice
Guys,
when
someone
you
die
for
sticks
a
steak
knife
in
your
heart
Do
you
try
more?
Another
late
night
in
She
stumbles
through
my
door,
lets
the
daylight
in
And
all
we
do's
fight
more
And
I
ain't
violent
But
she's
goin'
through
my
drawers
to
plant
the
K-Y
in
I'm
gettin'
accused
by
a
whore
Who
smells
like
cyanides
and
Who
has
probably
screwed
five
more
guys,
sucked
eight,
nine
men
I'm
takin'
two
by
fours,
to
our
eight
by
tens
Bitch
it's
you
I
tore,
out
the
frame,
I
win
Put
up
a
new
high
score,
beat
this
game
I'm
in
And
here's
some
two-ply
for
When
you
date
my
friends,
in
order
to
wipe
your
ass
When
you
moved
your
bowels
When
we
renewed
our
vows
This
the
thanks
I
get
I'm
waitin'
for
the
date
I
can
hear
you
say,
"Marshall,
what
a
skank
I've
been
And
there's
a
new
guy,
you're
being
replaced
by
him"
Got
your
tubes
tied
for
him
Got
that
boob
job
for
him
Hurts
me
to
my
core
But
the
pain
I'm
in,
after
you
I
swore
To
make
the
gray
skies
in
Here
comes
the
rays
like
wind
You
get
a
pay
hike,
and,
am
I
the
good
guy,
or?
Do
I
just
play
like
him
and
hope
that
he
dumps
you?
It's
like
the
dream
come
true,
just
to
scream
"Fuck
you"
Guess
you
take
life
in
the
same
way
you
play
dice
then
'Cause
you
just
look
at
me
and
roll
them
little
snakes
eyes
in
Since
you
bought
the
jury,
they'll
call
me
guilty,
they'll
call
me
guilty
You
bought
the
jury,
they'll
call
me
guilty,
even
though
you
know
the
real
me
You
can't
be
the
cheater,
convincin'
nonbeliever
And
I
ain't
in
my
feelings,
I'm
out
but
I
let
you
say
that
you're
the
good
guy
'Cause
this
ain't
what
love
looks
like
You
can't
be
the
cheater,
convincin'
nonbeliever
And
I
ain't
in
my
feelings,
I'm
out
but
I
let
you
say
that
you're
the
good
guy
They
like,
"You're
the
good
guy,"
they
like,
they
like
They
like,
"You're
the
good
guy"
I
got
a
song
filled
with
shit
for
the
strong
willed
When
the
world
gives
you
a
raw
deal
Set
you
off
till
you
Scream,
piss
off,
screw
you
When
it
talks
to
you
like
you
don't
belong
Or
tells
you
you're
in
the
wrong
field
When's
something's
in
your
mitochondrial
'Cause
it
latched
on
to
you,
like
Knock
knock,
let
the
devil
in,
malevolent
As
I've
ever
been,
head
is
spinnin'
and
this
medicine
Screaming,
"L-l-l-let
us
in"
L-l-lick
like
a
salad
bowl,
Edgar
Allen
Poe
Bedridden,
shoulda
been
dead
a
long
time
ago
Liquid
Tylenol,
gelatin,
think
my
skeleton's
meltin'
Wicked,
I
get
all
high
when
I
think
I've
smelled
the
scent
Of
elephant
manure
Element
glue,
screw
it,
to
hell
with
it
I
went
through
hell
with
accelerance
and
blew
up
My-my-myself
again,
Volkswagen,
tailspin
Bucket
matches
my
pale
skin,
metal
in
Went
from
Hellmann's
and
being
rail
thin,
Filet-o-Fish
Scribbles
and
Olympics
'97
Freaknik
How
can
I
be
down?
Me
and
Bizarre
in
Florida
Proof's
room
slept
on
floor
in
the,
motel
then
Dr.
Dre
said,
"Hell
yeah"
And
I
got
his
stamp
like
a
pouch
card,
word
to
Mel-Man
And
I
know
they're
gonna
hate
but
I
don't
care,
I
Barely
could
wait
to
hit
them
with
the
snare
and
the
bass
Square
in
the
face,
this
fuckin'
world
better
prepare
to
get
laced
Because
they're
gonna
taste
my
Venom
(I
got
that)
Adrenaline
in
'em
(venom)
Not
knowing
with
'em
Never
gonna
slow
up
in
'em
Ready
to
step
in
momentum
Thinking
it's
time
to
go
get
'em
They
ain't
gonna
know
what
hit
'em
(When
they
get
bitten
with
the)
Venom
(I
got
that)
Adrenaline
in
'em
(venom)
Not

with
'em
Never
gonna

Ready

'em
They
ain't

'em
(When
they
get
bit

I
said
knock
knock,
let
the
devil
in
Shotgun
p-p-pellets
in
the
felt
pin
Cocked,
fuck
around
and
catch
a
hot
one
I-i-it's
evident
I'm
not
done
V-venomous,
the
thought
spun
like
your
web
and
you
just
caught
in
'em
Held
against
your
will
like
a
hubcap
or
a
mud
flap
Be
strangled
or
attacked
So
this
ain't
gonna
feel
like
a
love
tap
Eat
painkiller
pills,
fuck
a
blood
track
Like,
what's
her
name
at
the
wheel?
Then
a
cup
catch
up
Through
the
car
into
reverse
at
the
end
of
the
nut
ration
And
you
look
back
and
it's
just
mangled
steel
My
Mustang
and
Jeep
Wrangler
grill
With
the
front
smashed,
much
as
my
rear
for
the
assassin
Slim
be
the
combination
of
an
actual
kamikaze
and
Gandhi
Translation,
I
will
probably
kill
us
both
when
I
end
up
Backin'
into
ya
You
ain't
gonna
be
able
to
tell
what
the
fuck's
happened
End
of
ya,
when
you're
bit
with
the
Venom
(I
got
that)
Adrenaline
in
'em
(venom)
Not
knowing
with
'em
Never
gonna
slow
up
in
'em
Ready
to

Thinking
it's

(When

I
said,
"Knock
knock,
let
the
devil
in,
alien"
E-E-Elliot
phone
home,
ain't
no
telling
when
this
choke
hold
On
this
game
will
end,
I'm
loco
Became
a
symbiote,
so
My
fangs
are
in
your
throat,
ho
You're
steppin'
in
with
my
Venom
Put
the
ballpoint
pen
'em
Gun
cock,
bump
stock,
devil
eye,
buckshot
Tied
for
the
uppercut
Tie
a
couple
knots,
fired
up
and
caught
Fire
juggernaut
Punk
rock
bitches
going
down
like
Yung
Joc
'Cause
the
Doc
put
me
on
like
sunblock
Why
the
fuck
not?
You
only
get
one
shot
Ate
shit
till
I
can't
taste
it
Chased
it
with
straight
liquor
Then
bathe
in
'em
then
drank
till
I
faint
And
I
wait
with
a
headache
and
I
take
anything
in
Rectangular
shape,
then
I
wait
To
face
the
demons
I'm
bonded
to
'Cause
they're
chasing
me
but
I'm
part
of
you
So
escaping
me
is
impossible
I
latch
onto
you
like
a
Parasite,
and
I
probably
ruined
your
parents'
life
And
your
childhood
too
'Cause
if
I'm
the
music
that
y'all
grew
up
on
I'm
responsible
for
you
retarded
fools
I'm
the
supervillain
dad
and
mom
was
losin'
their
marbles
to
You
marvel
that?
Eddie
Brock
is
you
And
I'm
the
suit,
so
call
me
Venom
(I
got
that)
Adrenaline
in
'em
(venom)
Not
knowing
with
'em
Never
gonna
slow
up
in
'em
Ready
to
step
in

Thinking
it's

They
ain't

They

'em
(When
they
get

Oh,

Alright
Amen
I

Shake

Nigga,
we
made
it,
made
it,
they
hate
it,
hate
it
Pro
professional,
pure
persistent,
I'm
paper
chasing
I
hate
complaining,
I
hated
waiting,
I'll
pay
for
patience
But
I
hate
to
pay
a
bill
(Hate
that)
And
I
made
a
mil
without
a
major
deal
(I
made
that)
Yeah,
her
ass
fake,
but
she
came
for
real
(She
came,
uh)
Money
ain't
a
thing,
that
ain't
a
thing
for
real
It's
the
broke
lingo
(Huh)
And
no,
ain't
nothing
Saweetie,
this
is
no
Quavo
(Migo)
Man,
I
just
get
high,
let
my
hoes
lay
low
(Ooh)
I
just
want
some
face
but
this

no
facial
(Ooh)
Do

and
kill
er'body,
Drake

(Hello)
Bitch,
I'm

(Hello)
Disrespect
your

(Grrr)
You

(Huh)
I'm

What

I'm

Wayne

(Facts)
Neck

I'm

(Drip,

Eight

eight
hittas,

eight
souls
(Brrr)
Collect
pesos
(Huh),
and
I'm
paid,
so?
(Paid)
Self-made
goals
(Hey)
When
the
pain
leaves
(Huh)
Where
does
the
pain
go?
(Where?)
Tip
of
the
backwood
is
where
the
flame
goes
(There)
To
the
sky
is
where
my
brain
goes
(Wow)
Same
pack,
same
fiend,
sellin'
the
same
clothes
(Wow)
Pinocchio
and
my
pistol,
they
got
the
same
nose
Me
and
my
niggas
gotta
eat,
we
share
the
same
stove
(What?)
Case
closed,
bodies
in
my
lane,
bitch,
lane
closed
Game
over,
Thanos
on
you
H-O's
On
my
petty
shit
but
I
don't
paint
toes
(Yeah)
Get
the
plunger
(Plunger)
'cause
Marshall
and
M.A
go
plum
crazy
Call
us
liquid
plumber,
'cause
even
Dre
know
(Dre
know)
Beat
knocks
like
a
beefed
up
Detox,
you're
gonna
need
three
SWATs
A
police
officer's
at
least
cuffing
me
up
for
evading
and
I
don’t
stop
Please
dawg,
I
need
y'all
to
keep
talking
shit
'cause
I
feed
off
of
it
I
am
the
complete
opposite
of
these
retards
who
spit
these
weak
bars,
I'ma
leave
carnage
Each
thought'll
be
so
toxic,
it'll
block
the
wind
through
your
esophagus
Stop
it,
cutting
off
your
oxygen
And
I
hit
them
pads
like
a
boxing
gym
Better
watch
for
Slim,
better
get
to
popping
when
I'm
at
the
top
again
I
won't
topple
and
I'm
giving
it
to
anyone
who
wanna
come
and
get
it
and
I'm
not
gonna
stop
But
when
they
ask
me
is
the
war
finished
with
MGK?
Of
course
it
is
I
cleansed
him
of
his
mortal
sins,
I'm
God
and
the
Lord
forgives
even
the
devil
worshippers
I'm
moving
on
but
you
know
your
scruples
are
gone
when
you're
born
with
Lucifer's
horns
And
you're
from
the
school
of
Notorious,
Puba,
Cube
and
The
Poor
Righteous
Teachers
tutored
my
students
Showed
them
all
the
blueprint
and
formula
But
it
seems
like
the
more
they
studied
my
music,
the
more
they
remind
me
of
eyeballs
I'm
watching
my
pupils
get
cornier
(Uh)
But
I'm
contemplating
yelling
"Bombs
away"
on
the
game
Like
I'm
outside
of
an
Ariana
Grande
concert
waiting
Here
comes
Saddam
Hussein,
Ayatollah
Khomeini
Where's
Osama
been?
I
been
laden
lately
Look
at
how
I'm
behaving,
they
want
me
gone
away
They
wanna
JonBenet
me
(Fuck
you),
I'm
unaccommodating
Man,
I
don't
see
why
they
hate
me
I'm
a
clown
like
John
Wayne
Gacy
They
call
me
Kanye
crazy
APESHIT,
Beyonce,
Jay-Z
And
I'm
back
with
Andre,
baby
And
the
doctor's
operating
But
he
never
put
no
scrubs
on
from
Snoop
kid
out
to
Shady
Shady
like
a
shadow
or
your
silhouette,
intellect,
I
better
check
to
see
why
you
feel
upset
'Cause
I
met
your
bitch
on
the
internet
now
I'm
getting
head
like
a
Pillow
Pet
That
bimbo
Kim
put
her
lips
all
the
way
around
this
bone
and
then
blow
Like
a
dusty
cartridge
from
an
old
Nintendo
Those
were
the
days
but
I
bet
you,
I'm
never
gonna
be
broke
again,
no
I
don't
smoke
but
I
got
paper,
to
be
blunt,
I'm
rolling
Indo
And
I
keep
it
one
comma,
zero,
zero,
zero,
zero
Real,
real,
real,
murder,
murder,
murder,
kill,
kill,
kill
Nickle-plated,
twenty
two,
two,
two
Bitch,
shut
the
fuck
up
'fore
I
shoot
you
too
Ain't
shit
I
won't
do
just
to
get
a
few
YouTube
views
Run
up
in
a
church
like
pew,
pew,
pew
'Cause
that's
what
I
do,
do,
do
But,
even
to
the
untrained
human
eye
We
ain't
the
same,
you
and
I
Somebody
should
have
explained
to
you
why
For
you
to
go
against
me,
it's
simply
insane,
you
will
die
(Yeah)
That's
why
they
call
me
Kamikaze,
it's
plain
suicide,
yeah
But
I
know
magic
and
here
go
my
last
trick
I'm
'bout
to
say
"Abracadabra"
and
pull
a
B
Rabbit
up
out
of
my
hat
I'm
about
to
relapse
and
I
betcha
that
you
won't
know
how
to
react
But
a
look
of
disgust,
I
don't
doubt
it'd
be
that
As
I
begin
to
fuckin'
devour
the
track
And
you
backpedal
that
as
a
cowardly
act
Like
a
Saudi
attack
when
the
towers
collapse
Here
comes
Saddam
Hussein,
Ayatollah
Khomeini
Where's
Osama
been?
I
been
laden
lately
Look
at
how
I'm
behaving
me,
they
want
me
gone
away
They
wanna
JonBenet
me
(Fuck
you),
I'm
unaccommodating
Pray
you
see
tomorrow
lil'
boy,
you
gon'
learn
All
them
pretty
bitches
leave
yo'
ass
in
the
earth
You
ain't
sold
your
last
rock,
you

earn
But
I
pray
you

tomorrow
lil'
boy,
you

Pray

All

You

But

lil'

I'm
a
product
of
properly
hoppin'
up
out
of
that
poverty
Profitin'
all
for
coppin'
and
scrappin'
that
property
all
for
a
possible
monopoly
Try
not
to
adopt
my
father's
old
philosophies
Same
time
I'm
prayin'
to
God
that
everything
works
out
at
his
colonoscopy
I
walk
in
the
crossroad,
suicidal
tightrope
intentionally
While
the
demons
comin'
out
of
me
Wifey's
on
the
side
of
me
talkin'
sense
into
me
Without
she,
I
feel
incomplete
mentally,
she's
been
sent
to
me
Right
there
since
'96,
worse
nightmare
to
side
chicks,
some
things
are
just
meant
to
be
Deal
with
life
This
it
for
me,
give
my
daughters
a
kiss
for
me
Y'all
call
this
fame,
I
call
this
shit
alcoholistic
infamy
Targettin'
my
kids
and
babies
through
population
and
gun
control
Shit
make
me
wanna
make
a
hunnid
more
Make
a
bigot
racist
uncomfortable
If
y'all
against
talk
and
reparation
then
I'm
not
against
the
thought
of
separation
While
the
politicians
that
are
white
and
privileged
ask
how
is
this
different
from
segragation,
that's
funny
bro
The
segregation
is
bein'
told
where
I'm
gonna
go
Separation
is
bein'
woke
and
goin'
wherever
I
wanna
go
Pray
you
see
tomorrow
lil'
boy,

gon'
learn
All

lil'

Never
sold
dope,
from
the
gold
rope
Wanted
one
though,
they
were
so
dope
(Yeah)
Was
a
have-not
(Yeah)
'cause
my
pockets
(Uh)
Didn't
have
knots,
I
was
so
broke
On
my
last
rock,
for
my
slingshot
Better
haul
ass,
don't
be
no
slow
poke
(Nope)
Through
the
tall
grass,
run
your
ass
off
(Yeah)
Oh
no,
got
your
pants
caught
on
the
fence
post
Getting
chased,
by
them
Jackboys,
think
it's
'bout
to
fuzz
Like
a
lint
roller
they
wait
'til
it's
late,
they
will
tiptoe
Through
your
living
room
window
Take
your
Nintendo
and
then
skate
Making
you
feel
like
you
got
bent
over
and
raped
Little
boy,
you're
never
gonna
get
no
rope
chain
Get
your
shit
stole,
and
your
lip
swole,
I
became
bitter
As
I
got
a
little
bit
older,
my
hate
Was
making
me
get
cold,
and
began
to
get
a
chip
shoulder
Started
to
spit
vulgar,
my
ZIP
code
had
been
skid
row
But
I
ate
every
single
beat
that
I
spit
over,
the
shithole
I
escaped
Then
I
began
to
explode,
detonate,
now
the
Eastside
went
schizo
Thought
my
name
was
B-side
'cause
they
flipped
over
my
tape
And
I
won't
hesitate
To
get
'em
all
bent
so
outta
shape
Oh
shit
bro,
hold
up,
wait
I
just
tripped
over
my
cape
(Superman)
And
I'm
not
gonna
let
'em
treat
the
paper
like
I'm
chopping
a
letter
Dre'll
tell
you
how
I
shred
So
when
you
refer
to
the
guy
next
to
the
doc,
you
meant
shredder
Now
the
cops
wanna
set
up
roadblocks
on
my
head,
I
Got
several
bounties
from
feds
in
every
county
I'm
with
a
gal
at
a
Checkers
wiling
Bumping
"Fuck
Da
Police"
while
I'm
federales
This
shit
is
like
Romparoo
Why
do
I
feel
responsible
for
these
kids?
All
of
whom
I'm
a
father
to
I'm
a
God
to
you,
y'all
better
worship
the
water
I
walk
on
Or
y'all
gonna
meet
your
Waterloo
I
get
to
flippin'
the
mic'
as
a
murder
weapon
I'm
poppin'
an
extra
clip,
then
cock
and
shoot,
then
I'm
popping
Do
not
let
me
catch
you
slippin'
I
will
pop
up
and
I'll
take
a
spot
from
you
I'll
get
to
doing
what
a
leaky
faucet
do
But
I
ain't
talkin'
drip
when
I
say
that
I'll
get
the
drop
on
you
Singin'
fuck
all
of
you
in
Autotune
I
am
too
volatile
and
too
grizzly
to
bear
Yeah,
shit
is
gettin'
to
where
I
can
barely
even
sit
in
a
chair
I
bust
my
ass
for
this
shit
and
I
swear
It
ain't
even
worth
dissing
someone
so
offbeat
That
they
can't
even
figure
out
where
their
words
Should
hit
the
kick
and
the
snare
Pray

All

You

Let

at
you
D.A.
got
that
dope
It's
one
of
those
kinda
nights
Yes,
this
beat’s
takin'
me
back
to
my
D12
days
When
we
hit
the
club
to
go
and
hell-raise
Probably
end
up
back
in
the
cocktail
waitress
And
takin'
her
straight
back
to
the
motel,
ayy
Yeah,
Bizzare’s
tryna
get
a
lapdance
Off
a
Xan
next
to
Jack
Dan'
(Ayo)
Stripper
walk
by,
I'm
like
"Goddamn"
She's
like
"That's
harassment,"
I'm
like
"Yeah,
and?"
(Woo)
Holy
Toledo,
it's
Miss
Ohio
That's
the
best
ass
I’ve
seen
in
a
while
We
should
be
datin’,
she's
from
Cleveland
But
she’s
a
bengal,
this
chick
is
catty
Is
that
a
mini-skirt
if
it's
a
maxi?
That's
the
shortest
thing
for
a
dress
since
an
addy
She
said
"Fuck
off"
and
threw
her
liquor
at
me
It's
one
of
those
kinda
nights
Then
I
said,
I
said
If
you
wanna
go
hard
tonight
Well
then,
the
smoke
and
the
bottle
are
on
me,
ah
Slip
into
the
red
dress
you
like
When
we
arrive,
we
probably
won’t
leave,
ah
I
love
the
way
you
move
like
that
When
you
push
your
body
on
mine,
oh
my
You
wanna
smoke,
drink,
dance
until
the
sun
rise
It's
one
of
those
kinda
nights
This
beat
keeps
takin'
me
back
like
my
ex
does
Only
'cause
how
good
the
sex
was
Hit
up
the
next
club,
met
Alexa
But
she
was
so
extra,
called
her
etcetera
Had
her
like,
"Oh
my
God
My
whole
iPod's
filled
with
your
songs,
I
mow
my
lawn
to
'em"
I
said,
"Oh
my
God,
you
know
my
songs?
That's
totally
awesome,
I'm
Marshall,
what's
goin'
on?
Ah
(Haha)
Seriously
though,
jokes
aside,
how
you
doin'?
You
straight?"
She
said,
"No,
I'm
bi"
She
said,
"Are
you
drunk?,"
I
said,
"No,
I'm
high
I'm
checkin'
out
the
chick,"
she
said,
"So
am
I"
"What's
in
the
cup,
let
me
see
that
Girl,
where
the
rest
of
that
promethazine
at"
She
said,
"Cool,
gotta
run
out
to
my
Cadillac
though
And
I'll
be
like
Fat
Joe,
and
bring
the
lean
back"
Then
I
said
If
you
wanna
go
hard
tonight
Well
then,
the
smoke
and
the
bottle
are
on
me,
ah
Slip
into
the
red
dress
you
like
When
we
arrive,
we
probably
won't
leave,
ah
I

on
mine,
oh

You
wanna
smoke,
drink,
dance
until
the
sun
rise
It's
one
of
those
kinda—
OMG
Like
the
gas
in
the
tank,
she's
gettin'
low
on
me
Said
she
wants
to
go
with
me
I
said,
"Go
with
you
where?"
She
said,
"Out"
I
said,
"I'm
a
candle,
I'll
go
out
if
you
blow
on
me"
Walk
her
out
to
the
parkin'
lot,
here
comes
the
brigade
Turn
like
a
flip
page,
50
look
shitfaced
Say
peace
to
McVay
and
me
and
this
chick
take
off
like
a
sick
day
Drivin'
around,
I
said,
"Let's
pull
over,"
she
said,
"No
problemo
Windows
are
dark
tint,
roll
up
the
car
windows
Monte
Carlo
in
park,
bumpin'
Bizarre's
demo
Gettin'
head
in
the
bucket,
Marshmello
Yeah,
I
never
in
the
club
met
a
woman
worth
knowin'
But
if
you're
ho'in
Opposites
attract,
I'm
someone,
you're
a
no
one
I'm
high
and
you're
bi,
I'm
comin',
you're
goin'
If
you
wanna
go
hard
tonight
Well
then,
the
smoke
and
the
bottle
are
on
me,
ah
Slip
into
the
red
dress
you
like
When
we
arrive,
we
probably
won't

ah
I
love
the
way
you

like
that
When
you
push
your
body
on
mine,
oh
my
You
wanna
smoke,
drink,
dance
until
the
sun
rise
It's
one
of
those
kinda
nights
"This
could
never
work,"
is
what
we
said
at
first
But
whatever
this
is,
it's
working
But
we're
in
two
different
worlds
and
(Yeah)
I'm
not
your
husband
(Nah),
you
ain't
my
girlfriend
All
I
know
is
that
(What?)
When
I'm
with
you,
I'm
a
different
person,
yeah
And
I
ain't
never
met
a
chick
as
perfect
Girl,
you're
a
ten,
so
here
I
am
(Yeah)
Laying
here
with
her
again
Thinking
'bout
you
She's
asleep,
you're
texting
me
around
two
Crying
face
emoji,
you
say
this
is
me
without
you
Worth
sneaking
out
to
me,
the
cheap
hotel
rooms
or
Sex
in
the
car,
then
I'll
text
you
tomorrow
Do
I
question
it?
Nah,
no
objection
at
all
'Cause
both
of
us
are
still
involved,
so
As
I'm
peelin'
off,
all
I'm
thinking
'bout
is
I'm
not
happy
here
(Nah),
with
her
Rather
have
you
(Yeah),
rather
have
me
too
'Cause
you're
not
happy
there
(You're
not
happy
there),
with
him
Rather
have
me
(I
know,
but),
we
just
in
too
deep
You're
laying
there
with
him,
thinking
'bout
me
He's
asleep,
you
say,
"Let's
meet
around
three"
You
went
to
leave
the
house,
he
caught
you
sneaking
out,
now
he's
freaking
out
You
thought
he
was
sleepin'
soundly,
woah
You
say
you're
going
for
a
drive,
you
don't
question
him
When
he
stumbles
in,
like,
"Where
the
fuck
you've
been?"
Then
you
pump
his
ear
with
what
he
wants
to
hear
Tell
him
you
love
him,
yeah,
wipe
each
other's
tears
But
it's
been
a
couple
years
since
we
been
doin'
dirt
You
or
my
girl,
don't
wanna
see
either
of
you
get
hurt
But
now
the
lines
are
getting
super
blurred
Can't
tell
if
I'm
cheating
on
her
with
you
or
cheating
on
you
with
her
But
really,
nobody's
at
fault,
can't
help
who
you
love
Hope
they
don't
ever
hear
us
talk
'Cause
we
both
are
getting
sloppy
Probably
subconsciously
part
of
me's
hoping
we
get
caught
'cause
I'm
not
happy
here
(Nah),
with
her
Rather
have
you
(Yeah),
rather
have
me
too
'Cause
you're
not
happy
there
(You're
not
happy
there),
with
him
Rather
have
me
(I
know,
but),
we
just
in
too
deep
We're
laying
here
with
them,
thinking
'bout
us
'Cause
now
when
we
get
home,
we
get
jealous
Of
each
other
being
someone
else's
Call
us
Long
John
Silver's
'cause
we
selfish
But
I
just
wanna
see
ya
Don't
care
if
it's
at
the
Ritz
or
Motel
6
If
I'm
there
with
ya,
rich
or
poor
When
I'm
laying
here
with
ya,
it
could
be
the
kitchen
floor
I
could
stay
in
bed
with
ya
starin'
at
ya
'til
the
morn'
I
just
wanna
be
your
secret
lover,
yeah
I'd
rather
share
ya
than
to
not
have
you
at
all
So
once
a
year
or
twice
a
month
I'm
here
if
you
want
it
Yeah,
I'm
open
season
And
I'm
always
game,
so
keep
it
a
hundred,
dear,
haha
'Cause
we
could
never
be
each
other's
everythings,
you
got
a
wedding
ring
So
it's
him
instead
of
me,
but
I'll
be
your
second
string,
now
and
forever
because
I'm
not
happy
here
(Nah),
with
her
Rather
have
you
(Yeah),
rather
have
me
too
'Cause
you're
not
happy
there
(You're
not
happy
there),
with
him
Rather
have
me
(I
know,
but),
we
just
in
too
deep
(I'm
in
way
too
deep)
Ugh,
you're
a
monster
I
can
swallow
a
bottle
of
alcohol
and
I'll
feel
like
Godzilla
Better
hit
the
deck
like
the
card
dealer
My
whole
squad's
in
here,
walking
around
the
party
A
cross
between
a
zombie
apocalypse
and
big
Bobby
"The
Brain"
Heenan
which
is
probably
the
Same
reason
I
wrestle
with
mania
Shady's
in
this
bitch,
I'm
posse'd
up
Consider
it
to
cross
me
a
costly
mistake
If
they
sleepin'
on
me,
the
hoes
better
get
insomnia
ADHD,
hydroxycut
Pass
the
Courvoisi'
(Hey,
hey)
In
AA
with
an
AK,
melee,
finna
set
it
like
a
playdate
Better
vacate,
retreat
like
a
vacay,
mayday
This
beat
is
cray-cray,
Ray
J,
H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing
all
the
way
to
the
bank,
I
spray
flings
They
cannot
tame
or
placate
the
(Ayy)
Monster
You
get
in
my
way,
I'ma
feed
you
to
the
monster
(Yeah)
I'm
normal
during
the
day,
but
at
night,
turn
to
a
monster
(Yeah)
When
the
moon
shines
like
Ice
Road
Truckers
I
look
like
a
villain
outta
those
blockbusters
Godzilla,
fire
spitter,
monster
Blood

the
dance
floor,
and
on
the
Louis

Fire,

Blood

and
on
the
Louis
V
carpet
I'm
just
a
product
of
Slick
Rick,
at
Onyx,
told
'em
lick
the
balls
Had
'em
just
appalled
at
so
many
things
that
pissed
'em
off
It's
impossible
to
list
'em
all
And
in
the
midst
of
all
this
I'm
in
a
mental
hospital
with
a
crystal
ball
Tryna
see,
will
I
still
be
like
this
tomorrow?
Risperdal,
voices
whisper
My
fist
is
balled
back
up
against
the
wall,
pencil
drawn
This
is
just
the
song
to
go
ballistic
on
You
just
pulled
a
pistol
on
the
guy
with
the
missile
launcher
I'm
just
a
Loch
Ness,
the
mythological
Quick
to
tell
a
bitch
go
off
like
a
fifth
of
Vodka
When
you
twist
the
top
of
the
bottle,
I'm
a
Monster
You
get
in
my
way,
I'ma
feed
you
to
the
monster
(Yeah)
I'm
normal
during
the
day,
but
at
night,
turn
to
a

(Yeah)
When
the

If
you
never
gave
a
damn,
raise
your
hand
'Cause
I'm
about
to
set
trip,
vacation
plans
I'm
on
point
like
my
index
is,
so
all
you
will
ever
get
is
The
motherfuckin'
finger
(Finger),
prostate
exam
('Xam)
How
can
I
have
all
these
fans
and
perspire?
Like
a
liar's

I'm
on
fire
And
I
got
no
plans
to
retire
and
I'm
still
the
man
you
admire
These
chicks
are
spazzin'
out,
I
only
get
more
handsome
and
flier
I
got
'em
passin'
out
like
what
you
do
when
you
hand
someone
flyers
And
what
goes
around
comes
around
just
like
the
blades
on
a
chainsaw
'Cause
I
caught
the
flap
of
my
dollar
stack
right
off
the
bat
like
a
baseball
Like
Kid
Ink,
bitch,
I
got
them
racks
with
so
much
ease
that
they
call
me
Diddy
'Cause
I
make
bands
and
I
call
getting
cheese
a
cakewalk
(Cheesecake,
yeah)
Bitch,
I'm
a
player,
I'm
too
motherfuckin'
stingy
for
Cher
Won't
even
lend
you
an
ear,
ain't
even
pretending
to
care
But
I
tell
a
bitch
I'll
marry
her
if
she'll
bury
her
Face
on
my
genital
area,
the
original
Richard
Ramirez
Christian
Rivera,
'cause
my
lyrics
never
sit
well
So
they
wanna
give
me
the
chair
Like
a
paraplegic,
and
it's
scary,
call
it
Harry
Caray
'Cause
every
time
a
Dick
and
Harry
carry
and
marry
a
motherfuckin'
dictionary
Got
'em
swearing
up
and
down,
they
can't
spit,
this
shit's
hilarious
It's
time
to
put
these
bitches
in
the
obituary
column
We
wouldn't
see
eye
to
eye
with
a
staring
problem
Get
the
shaft
like
a
staring
column
(Mark
Jack)
Trigger
happy,
pack
heat,
but
it's
black
ink
Give
'em
half
of
the
bad
beats
Evil,
that
means
take
a
back
seat
Take
it
back
to
Fat
Petes
with
a
maxi,
single
Look
at
my
rap
sheets,
what
attracts
these
people
Is
my
gangster,
bitch,
like
Apache
with
a
catchy
jingle
I
stack
chips,
you
barely
got
a
half-eaten
Cheeto
Fill
'em
with
the
venom
and
eliminate
'em
Other
words,
I
Minute
Maid
'em
I
don't
want
to
hurt
'em,
but
I
did
'em
in
a
fit
of
rage
I'm
murderin'
again,
nobody
will
evade
him
Finna
kill
'em
and
dump
all
the
fuckin'
bodies
in
the
lake
Obliterating
everything,
incinerate
and
renegade
'em
And
I
make
anybody
who
want
it
with
the
pen
afraid
And
don't
nobody
want
it,
but
they're
gonna
get
it
anyway
'Cause
I'm
beginnin'
to
feel
like
I'm
mentally
ill
And
I
tell
'em
kill
or
be
killed,
I'm
a
killer,
be
the
vanilla
gorilla
You're
bringin'
the
killer
within
me
out
of
me
You
don't
want
to
be
the
enemy
of
the
demon
who
went
in
me
Or
be
recievin'
enemy,
what
stupidity
it'd
be
Every
bit
of
me
is
the
epitome
of
a
spitter
When
I'm
in
the
vicinity,
motherfucker,
you
better
duck
Or
you
finna
be
dead
the
minute
you
run
into
me
A
hundred
percent
of
you
is
a
fifth
of
a
percent
of
me
I'm
'bout
to
fuckin'
finish
you
bitch,
I'm
unfadable
You
wanna
battle,
I'm
available,
I'm
blowin'
up
like
an
inflatable
I'm
undebatable,
I'm
unavoidable,
I'm
unevadable
I'm
on
the
toilet
bowl,
I
got
a
trailer
full
of
money
and
I'm
paid
in
full
I'm
not
afraid
to
pull
the
Man,
stop
Look
what
I'm
plannin',
haha
I
don't
wanna
be
alone,
I
don't
wanna
be
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
anymore
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
Here
I
am,
alone
again
Can't
get
out
of
this
hole
I'm
in
It's
like
the
walls
are
closin'
in
You
can't
help
me,
no
one
can
I
can
feel
these
curtains
closin'
I
go
to
open
'em
But
something
pulls
'em
closed
again
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
Feels
like
I'm
loathing
in
Las
Vegas
Haven't
got
the
vaguest
why
I'm
so
lost
But
I'd
make
you
this
small
wager
If
I
bet
you
I'll
be
in
tomorrow's
paper
Who
would
the
odds
favor?
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
I'm
so
much
like
my
father,
you
would
think
that
I
knew
him
I
keep
pacin'
this
room,
Valium
and
chase
it
with
booze
One
little
taste,
it'll
do
Maybe
I'll
take
it
and
snooze,
then
tear
up
the
stage
in
a
few
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
Fuck
the
Colt
45,
I'ma
need
somethin'
stronger
If
I
pop
any
caps,
it
better
be
off
of
vodka
Round
after
round
after
round,
I'm
gettin'
loaded
(Haha)
That's
a
lot
of
shots,
huh?
(Double
entendre)
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
And
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
(Yeah)
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
anymore
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
Now
I'm
starin'
at
the
room
service
menu
off
a
Benzo
I
can
hear
the
music
continue
to
crescendo
I
can
see
the
whole
fuckin'
venue
from
my
window
That's
when
you
know
you're
schizo
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
'Cause
I
keep
peekin'
out
the
curtain
from
the
hotel
The
music
is
so
loud
But
it's
almost
as
though
I
don't
hear
no
sound
I
should
get
ready
for
the
show
now
Wait
is
this
the
whole
crowd?
I
thought
this
shit
was
sold
out
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
But
it's
only
the
opening
act,
it's
early,
don't
overreact
Then
something
told
me
relax
And
just
hope
for
the
show
to
be
packed
Don't
wanna
hit
the
stage
before
they
fill
each
row
to
the
max
'Cause
that'd
be
totally
wack
You
can't
murder
a
show
nobody's
at
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
But
what
if
nobody
shows?
Panic
mode
'Bout
to
snap
and
go
motherfuckin'
wacko
at
any
second
'Bout
to
cancel
the
show
just
as
fans
below
rush
the
entrance
Plan
is
a
go
to
wreck
shit,
cameras
in
all
directions
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
The
press
is
about
to
go
ape
shit
bananas
on
all
the
networks
Commando
with
extra
clips,
I
got
ammo
for
all
the
hecklers
I'm
armed
to
the
teeth,
another
Valium,
fall
off
the
bed
Hit
the
ground
and
crawl
to
the
dresser
Alcohol
on
my
breath
as
I
reach
for
the
Scope
I'm
blackin'
out,
I'm
all
out
of
meds
With
them
benzodiazepines
gone
Now
it's
just
magazines
sprawled
out
on
the
floor
Fuck
the
media,
I'm
goin'
all
out,
this
is
war
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
And
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
(Yeah)
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
anymore
People
start
to
show
up,
time
to
start
the
show
up
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
It's
10:05
PM
and
the
curtain
starts
to
go
up
And
I'm
already
sweatin'
but
I'm
locked
and
loaded
For
rapid
fire
spittin'
for
all
the
concert-goers
Scopes
for
sniper
vision,
surprise
from
out
of
nowhere
As
I
slide
the
clip
in
from
inside
the
hotel
Leanin'
out
the
window,
going
Keyser
Söze
Finger
on
the
trigger,
but
I'm
a
licensed
owner
With
no
prior
convictions,
so
loss,
the
sky's
the
limit
So
my
supplies
infinite,
strapped
like
I'm
a
soldier
Got
'em
hopping
over
walls
and
climbing
fences
Some
of
them
John
Travolta,
staying
alive
by
inches
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
Cops
are
knockin',
oh
fuck,
thought
I
blocked
the
entrance
Guess
show
time
is
over
No
suicide
note,
just
a
note
for
target
distance
But
if
you'd
like
to
know
the
reason
why
I
did
this
You'll
never
find
a
motive,
truth
is
I
have
no
idea
I
am
just
as
stumped,
no
signs
of
mental
illness
Just
tryin'
to
show
ya
the
reason
why
we're
so
fucked
'Cause
by
the
time
it's
over,
won't
make
the
slightest
difference
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
And
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
I
don't
wanna
be
alone
in
the
darkness
anymore
(Hello
darkness,
my
old
friend)
Yeah,
we
do
have
some
breaking
news
from
the
Associated
Press
right
now,
just
gonna
bring
that
up
because
we
are
hearing
we
have
told
you
that
the
shooter
is
dead
and
we
have
just
learned
that
police
are
saying
that
the
Las
Vegas
shooter
killed
himself
That
is
the
bartender
there
at
Mandalay
Bay
and
I
believe
we're
going
to
hear
more
Yeah,
we
just
wanted
to
share
that
with
you,
you
can
see
behind
me
here,
this
is
what
he
looks
like,
now
we
did
just
tell
you
that
police
just
earlier,
Metro
was
telling
us
that
he
killed
himself
inside
the
hotel
room
Yeah
(I
knew
this
day
was
coming)
Sometimes,
you
gotta
come
back
down
(It's
all
going
to
hell
now,
man)
Stoop
to
someone's
level
(Yeah)
Five
dozen,
flies
buzzin'
over
your
head
Call
me
the
Grim
Reaper,
sleep
is
my
cousin
You
dead
to
me
now
and
I'ma
be
the
last
face
you
see
'Fore
you
die
cussin'
My
eye
a
tiger's
and
I'm
a
survivor
so
I
will
rise
up
and
(What?)
Be
triumphant
'cause
when
I'm
looking
at
my
legacy
(Leg,
I
see)
Bunch
of
dogs
gonna
tryna
dry
hump
it
Like
Triumph
The
Puppet,
so
I'm
like,
"Fuck
it"
Pile
the
carnage
up
'til
its
so
high,
it's
touching
the
sky
Let
'em
all
line
up
and
attack
Single
filing
up
in
the
stack
Call
'em
toy
soldiers
(Yeah)
'Cause
they
just
wind
up
on
their
backs
Now
the
sky's
nothing
but
black
But
I
am
not
coming
back,
I
done
told
ya
I
told
the
woke
me
to
go
to
sleep
But
still,
they
keep
on
provoking
me
They're
hoping
to
see
me
completely
broken
emotionally
But
how
in
the
fuck
am
I
not
supposed
to
be
woke
When
these
fuckers
just
keep
poking
me?
Now
I'm
leaving
Heaven
I'm
leaving
Heaven
Angels
won't
find
me
Where
are
you
going?
I've
been
down,
kicked
Like
around
six
thousand
times
since
I
was
a
kid
As
a
child,
picked
on,
clowned
Countless
times
I've
been
outed
Gotta
remind
myself
of
it
every
now
and
then
(Yeah)
So
the
route
I
went's
self-empowerment
In
a
hole,
taught
myself
how
to
get
out
of
it
And
balance
it
with
talents,
wit
'Cause
life
is
like
a
penny
(Life
is
like
a
penny)
'Cause
it's
only
one
percent
Who
overcome
the
shit
they've
underwent
I
went
AWOL
like
what
my
back
was
up
against
Don't
tell
me
'bout
struggle,
bitch,
I
lived
it
I
was
five
or
six
the
first
time
I
got
my
hind
end
kicked
Malcolm,
Isaac,
and
Boogie
jumped
me
and
took
my
tricycle
And
I
don't
know
if
I
would
call
that
white
privilege,
yeah
But
I
get
it,
how
it
feels
to
be
judged
by
pigment
Besides
getting
it
from
both
sides
of
the
tracks
But
I
swore
I'd
get
them
back
Even
if
it
meant
selling
my
soul
to
get
revenge
and
(What?)
Thought
of
a
scheme
and
it
got
me
to
thinking
If
I
can
believe
in
myself,
I
could
prolly
achieve
it
That’s
part
of
the
reason
I
do
all
my
talking
when
He
can
And
as
long
as
I'm
breathing
I
vow
to
smother
and
beat
them
Got
a
heart
of
a
demon,
go
at
'em
and
I'ma
get
even
Like
I'm
in
the
Garden
of
Eden,
I'm
'bout
to
go
off
of
the
deep
end
This
evil
is
calling,
I'm
already
seething
and
I'm
leaving
Heaven
I'm
leaving
Heaven
Angels
won't
find
me
Where
are
you
going?
Okay,
so
while
Macklemore
was
keeping
his
room
nice
and
neat
(Yeah)
I
was
getting
my
ass
beat
twice
a
week
(What?)
Looking
for
a
place
for
the
night
where
I
could
sleep
Flippin'
sofa
cushions
over
just
tryin'
to
see
If
I
could
find
some
change
and
scrape
up
for
a
bite
to
eat
If
Denaun
and
me
find
a
couple
dimes
a
piece
Twenty
five
cents
each'd
get
us
a
bag
of
chips
We'd
be
glad
to
get
that
even
we
if
we
had
to
split
We'd
do
backward
flips,
looking
back
at
it
I
think
that
would
fit
with
the
definition
of
not
having
shit
Couple
that
with
the
fact
my
mother
was
batshit
Pop
was
a
sack
of
shit,
yeah,
he
died,
but
I
gave
half
a
shit
Yeah,
which
brings
me
back
to
the
real
dad
that
I
zero
had
Since
a
year-old,
forty-seven
year-old
scab
Just
to
hear
them
words,
ear
piercing
Like
my
earlobe
stabbed
with
a
needle
for
an
earring
Should
I
feel
upset?
You
were
dead
to
me
'fore
you
died
Me?
Tear
no
shed
Should
I
have
made
a
mural
at
your
funeral?
Had
your
coffin
draped
with
a
hero's
flag?
Where
the
fuck
you
were
at
When
De'Angelo
done
hurt
me
real
bad
at
the
Rio
Grande?
Never
met
your
grandkids,
fucking
coward
Only
gut
you
had
was
from
your
stomach
fat
I
couldn't
see
your
ass
gonna
Heaven
So
I'm
asking
for
a
pass
to
go
to
Hell
So
I
can
whip
your
fucking
ass
I
hate
that
I'll
never
get
to
say
"I
hate
you"
to
your
face
No
coming
back
from
where
I'm
going
Sky
is
dark,
my
soul
is
black,
hand
on
the
shovel
Dig
with
the
blade
up,
and
then
I
step
on
the
metal
Vendetta
to
settle,
tell
the
Devil
I'm
leaving
Heaven
(Yeah)
I'm
leaving
Heaven
(You
know,
I
should
dig
your
motherfucking
ass
up)
Angels
won't
find
me
(Just
to
spit
in
your
fucking
face)
Where
are
you
going?
(Holding
my
baby
pictures
up
like
you're
proud
of
me)
I'm
leaving
heaven
(Fuck
you,
bitch)
I'm
leaving
heaven
(You
know
what?
Maybe
if
I
had
had
you)
Angels
won't
find
me
(I
wouldn't
have
went
through
half
the
shit
I
went
through,
so
I
blame
you)
Where
are
you
going?
(Or
maybe
I
should
say,
"Thank
you")
('Cause
I
wouldn't
have
been
me)
So
you
better,
you
better
run
(Yeah)
You
better,
you
better
run
(So
I'ma
let
it
go
now,
rest
in
peace)
You
better,
you
better
run
(Cocksucker)
You
better,
you
better
run
(See
you
in
Hell)
Yah,

(People)
Yah,

(Bitches)
Yah,

(Animals)
Yah,

Bumstickitty,
bumstickitty,
bum
huh
I
got
that
old
rump-pum-pum-pum
I
pump
a
junk
up
to
get
him
a
beat
down
At
least
sound,
I
sound
like
these
clowns,
like
he
sound
My
flow
all
over
the
place,
.44
in
the
waist
I'm
so-so
innovate,
if
po-po
went
away,
I
roll
over
'em
like
bacon
And
call
'em
a
pig,
won't
you
hop
up
off
of
my
dick?
Words
in
the
way,
I
get
lost
by
him
I
give
you
a
JFK
on
the
front
lawn
of
MLK
in
the
crossfire
(Get
down,
nigga)
I
have
evolved
into
the
lost
diaries
of
the
mob
and
the
Rothschilds
I
feel
like
God
broke
the
vials

Q-Tip
Man,
here
we
go
I
said
the
beat
left
in
the
land
of
criminals
My
era,
my
era,
my
era
so
original
Uh-uh,
I
survived
it
and
that's
a
miracle
Ah,
man
'Cause
I'm
from
Slaughterhouse
(People),
check
yourself
Like
Ice
Cube
said,
"Before
you
wreck
yourself"
(Bitches)
Like
Wu-Tang
said,
"You
should
protect
yourself"
(Animals)
I

Yah,

(Get

Yah,

Yo,
snappin'

plus
I'm

I'm
in
the
Slick
Rick
eyepatch,
but
I
got
it
from
Hex
Rappers
avoid
eye
contact,
that's
outta
respect
For
the
garden
of
flesh,
the
ominous
Indominus
Rex
They
be
like,
"You
put
the
Thought
on?
Yikes"
If
I
told
y'all
once,
I
told
y'all
twice,
that
motherfucker
is
nice
I'm
the
king
of
the
blood
sport,
all
mice
I'm
from
an
era,
you
had
beef?
You
prolly
fist
for
it
on
sight
Get
your
ass
beat
on
the
basketball
court
on
Spike
Then
tell
your
wife
to
put
your
life
support
on
ice
I'm
the
rap
Pernell
Whitaker,
the
honorable
minister
Leavin'
every
amateur
inoperable,
I
finished
'em
Makin'
plaques
outta
they
head
like
dead
venison
Used
to
beat
the
battle
to
neck
with
damn
militants
Spillin'
over
fabulous
jams
my
man
Dilla
sent
Rap
speak
for
me,
I
am
the
ventriloquist
I'm
so
stubborn,
the
government
won't
govern
That
brother
you
spoke
of,
it
just
wasn't
his
dope,
was
it?
I'm
coke
buzzin',
I
never
been
low
budget
The
taste
of
your
own
medicine,
here
come
a
dose
of
it
I
break
free
like
Chesimard
Keep
'em
guessin'
hard
while
my
broad
say
my
bars
just
like
ASMR
All
my
dogs
is
at
the
reservoir
Top
five,
I'm
where
the
legends
are
(Keep
goin')
Live
at
the
edge
of
darkness
and
light
One
phone
call
my
and
my
youngins
takin'
flight
You
a
bark,
bitch,
and
never
bite,
long
kiss
goodnight
I
stay
heated,
my
people
in
the
place
needed
If
you
ain't
standin'
up
for
yourself
then
stay
seated
And
they
cheated,
they
lie
like
a
marigold
Vespucci,
I'm
a
miracle,
I'm
still
super
lyrical
Live
from
the
Terrordome,
loud
like
a
megaphone
Thutmose
the
Third,
seven
inch,
heaven
bones
Man,
here
we
go
I
said
the
beat
left
in
the
land
of
criminals
My
era,
my

my
era
so
original
Uh-uh,
I

Yah,

Better
hope
an
ambulance
is
en
route
Papers
are
hand
grenades
soon
as
I
pull
the
pin
out
I
understand
and
say
Mandalay
and
Orlando
and
Colorado
and
Columbine
All
combine
into
one,
I
don't
walk
a
line,
bitch,
I
run
'Cause
we
don't
got
no
time
to
waste,
so
come
on
Denaun
They
call
me
five
to
nine,
and
thought
duh-dun,
duh-dun
Then
like
a
shotgun
I'm
ready
to
cock
it
on
'em
Leave
these
pussies
stretched
out,
like
the
Octo-Mom
Never
had
no
trouble
keepin'
up
with
the
times
I
just
adapt
to
the
climate,
I
treat
it
like
my
Levi's
When
they
ain't
buttoned
up
right,
I
adjust
on
the
fly
Middle
fingers,
put
'em
high,
that's
why
they
call
it
a
bird
'Cause
you
put
it
up
in
the
sky
And
I'm
like
a
spider
crawlin'
up
your
spinal
column
I'm
climbin'
all
up
the
sides
of
the
asylum
wall
And
dive
in
a
pile
of
Tylenol,
you
like
a
vagina
problem
To
a
diabolical
gynecologist,
tryna
ball
a
fist
I
will
Fuck
you
just
buy
me,
double
timing
the
rhyming
I
leave
you
stymied,
that's
why
they
still
vilify
me
like
Bill
O'Reilly
I'ma
show
you
what
I
mean
when
they
call
me
the
Harvey
Weinstein
of
2019
I'm
a
conniving,
when
I'm
on
the
mic
I'ma
standout
Like
a
lime
green
wife
beater
with
a
knife
out
I'm
a
sight
to
see,
but
you
can
see
from
the
ring
I'm
wearing
Me
and
this
game,
we
got
married
already
Had
the
prenup
ready,
fuck,
all
that's
ever
seen
her
belly
She
barely
was
three
months
pregnant
Bitch
had
to
give
me
a
baby,
we
named
it
Machine
Gun
Kelly
Now
here's

LL,
Big
L

Dell
K-Solo,
Treach

Rap
DJ

King
Tut,

From

Paris
B,
times
Oakland
and
C-M-P-R-T
N.W.A
and
Eazy-E,
and
D-R-E
was
like
my

Without
him,
I
don't

where
I'd
be
Man,

I

Hey,
yo
(This
song's
about)
My,
my
stepdad
(Let's
see
if
this
ever
happened
to
you)
I,
I
hate
My,
my
stepdad
One
thing
that
sticks
in
my
craw
When
I
was
six
and
I
saw
my
stepfather
hittin'
my
mom
Socked
her
right
in
her
eyeball
I'm
startin'
to
think
I'm
psychotic
With
all
the
pictures
that
I
draw
of
Shit
that
I
already
witnessed,
this
probably
twisted
my
thoughts
All
I
can
hear
is
drama
with
mom
and
him
I
can
always
hear
'em
arguin'
down
the
hallways
The
walls
are
thin
so
the
noise
is
startin'
to
feel
like
the
norm
My
dog
pissed
on
the
carpet,
he
stomped
it
so
hard
Doctors
had
to
put
it
down
He
killed
my
chihuahua,
this
motherfucker!
I,
I,
hate
My,
my
stepdad
(Stepdad)
So
tonight
I'm
sayin',
"Bye-bye
stepdad"
(Stepdad)
Outside,
I
look
like
I'm
calm
Inside,
I'm
a
tickin'
time
bomb
'Cause
of
this
motherfucker,
who
sticks
his
dick
in
my
mom
(My
mom)
Last
night,
he
said
I
left
the
kitchen
light
on
But
he
walked
in
there
this
morning
and
purposely
flipped
it,
I
saw
him
Hickory
switch
to
my
bottom,
I
counted
sixty-nine
times
He
swatted
me
with
it,
I'm
cryin'
He
just
started
hittin'
me
harder
God,
I
just
wish
I
could
jaw
him
If
I
could
get
my
weight
up
But
I'm
just
a
second
grader
This
prick
is
bigger
than
I
am
But
I've
been
readin'
at
school
about
this
shit
called
liquid
cyanide
I'm
fantasizin'
at
night
when
he's
sleepin'
at
just
the
right
time
Sneak
up
with
a
lethal
injection
And
put
him
down
like
they
did
to
my
dog
I'm
talkin'
euthanasia
(Euthanasia),
like
kids
in
Taiwan
This
fuckin'
shit's
like
Saigon
Neighbors
called
police
on
him
So
many
battery
charges,
this
dude's
like
lithium
ion
Then
mom
and
him
let
bygones
(Bygones)
Just
be
bygones
So
on
eggshells,
I
walk
and
just
try
not
to
piss
this
guy
off
But
this
why
I
I,
I,
hate
My,
my
stepdad
(Stepdad)
So
tonight
I'm
sayin',
"Bye-bye
stepdad"
(Stepdad)
So
this
year,
I'm
goin'
to
the
fifth
and
I'm
tall
I'm
five
foot
six
on
my
block,
I'm
the
toughest
kid
but
I
got
Way
bigger
fish
to
fry
Which
is
why
I'm
tryin'
to
get
this
bitch
to
fly
off
The
hand'll
wait
for
the
fist
to
fly
off
to
put
this
guy
in
a
pine
box
He's
always
lookin'
for
chaos
but
tonight
I've
cooked
up
a
plan
So
this
Christmas,
I
got
some
color
books
and
some
crayons
I'm
layin'
on
the
floor,
in
the
living
room
with
some
friends
colorin'
He
walks
by,
kicks
my
arm
and
goes
"Whoops"
and
just
laughs
I
yelled
for
mom
(Mom)
and
as
she's
rushin'
to
my
defense
I
stood
up
and
said,
"Fuck
you
punk"
and
I
took
off
and
ran
To
my
bedroom,
as
I
fled
Knowin'
shit
would
hit
the
fan
Slammed
the
door
and
hid
behind
it
with
an
aluminum
bat
He
kicked
it
in
I
swung
it
hard
as
I
could
at
his
head
His
noodle
went
splat,
he
fell
right
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
I'm
a
little
bit
scared
but
my
anger's
overtooken
the
fear
I
threw
down
the
bat
and
just
started
whoopin'
his
ass
Beat
him
with
my
bare
hands,
the
big
bad
wolf
ain't
so
bad
"Ding-dong,"
the
pussy
is
dead,
the
bully
finally
gets
his
Stomped
him
until
he
pissed
enough
to
fill
a
two
liter
with
Then
buried
him
next
to
my
dog
And
if
I
go
to
juvie
for
this,
I'ma
tell
'em
I,
I,
hate
My,
my
stepdad

(Stepdad)
My
name
is
Marsh
and
this
world,
I'm
out
of
it
(Out
of
it)
'Cause
with
all
this
A-B-C
shit,
I'm
startin'
to
sound
like
alphabet
Ha!
I
kill
me,
this
medicine's
counterfeit
I
was
mislead
by
the
sound
of
it,
how
am
I
gonna
get
turnt
up
on
this
Valium
shit?
Checked
in
at
the
Royal
Garden
To
chill
and
avoid
my
problems
Until
paranoia
caused
me
to
feel
like
I'm
going
bonkers
For
real,
think
my
toilet's
talkin'
I
spilled
like,
like
forty
bottles
of
pills
Think
your
boy
is
startin'
to
feel
like
a
spoiled
carton
of
milk
'Cause
it
just
occurred
My
girl's
cheatin',
I'm
kickin'
that
fuckin'
bitch
to
the
curb
But
the
word
"fuckin'"
ain't
meant
to
be
a
descriptive
word
The
type
of
bitch
she
is
ain't
no
adjective,
it's
a
verb
Ho
thinks
her
snatch
is
magical
but
that's
how
she
attracts
men
and
who
traps
'em
and
attack
similar
to
an
actual
arachnid
Or
a
vaginal
tarantula
or
black
widow
In
fact
it'll
be
nothing
to
throw
that
lil'
Bitch
with
a
capital
B
at
the
back
window
out
the
black
Cadillac
limo
like
a
whack
demo
When
I'm
strapped,
when
I
spit
rapid,
like
a
ratchet
A
halfwit,
I'll
aim
at,
then
I'll
Been
fire
bitch,
I
can't
outrap
Reynolds
Apparently
it'll
be
great
but
a
napkin'll
do
Return
of
the
whack
sicko
Head
spinnin'
like
invisible
scratch
pickles
Yeah,
Shady's
back,
see
the
bat
signal
It's
time
to
go
bat
shit,
like
you
accidentally
ate
a
Louisville
slugger
and
crapped
it,
I'd
like
to
introduce
myself
Hi
there,
bitch
my
name
is-
My
name
is
Marsh
and,
I'm
out
this
world
(This
world)
S
on
my
chest
(Superman)
like
it's
plural
(It's
lit)
Call
me
extra,
extra
terrestrial
Extra,
extra,
extra
terrestrial
I
could
keep
beefing
Fuck
is
the
point?
I
could
make
it
really
difficult
for
motherfuckers
to
come
to
Detroit
If
you're
still
looking
for
smoke,
I
already
gave
you
an
L
I'd
rather
just
see
you
in
hell
but
I
should
get
puff
on
the
joint
(Diddy)
Wait,
run
it
back,
I
said
gave
you
an
L,
in
hell
Puff
on
the
joint,
I
am
the
blunt
you
avoid
Used
to
get
jumped
for
my
poems
When
I
was
growin'
up
they
said
a
slinky's
a
wonderful
toy
My
mother
thought
I
was
such
a
fun
little
boy
"Oh,
what
a
bundle
of
joy!"
Until
the
morning
she
suffered
a
punch
in
the
groin
From
the
tantrum
I
was
throwing
Like
a
motherfuckin'
disgruntled
employee,
I
don't
cut
the
beat
till
I
fuckin'
destroy
it
Once
I
get
going
rain
thunder
it's
storming
Puddles
are
forming,
I
hear
somebody's
voice
In
my
head
said
it's
still
a
dream
Then
he
said
kill
emcee's
Trippie
Redd,
with
pills
on
lean
Sippin'
meds
in
the
limousine
Getting
head,
guillotine
My
name
is
Marsh
and,
I'm
out
this
world
(This
world)
S
on
my
chest
(Superman)
like
it's
plural
(It's
lit)
Call
me
extra,
extra
terrestrial
Extra,
extra,
extra
terrestrial
Yeah
So
all
of
y'all
can
just
suck
a
penis
(Suck
a
penis)
I'll
do
the
opposite
(I'll
do
the
opposite)
Eat
you
pussies
like
cunnilingus
(Like
cunnilingus)
There
ain't
no
stopping
it
(There
ain't
no
stopping
it)
They
say
I'm
such
a
genius
(They
say
I'm
such
a
genius)
When
that
kamikaze
hits
(When
that
kamikaze
hits)
Now
they
call
me
"Butter
fingers"
(They
call
me
"Butter
fingers")
'Cause
I
just
keep
droppin'
shit
(I
just
keep
droppin'
shit)
You
wanna
butt
heads?,
shut
up
Beavis,
ha
ha
I
got
your
bitch
with
her
butt
out
I'm
hittin'
a
lick
and
she
stickin'
her
tongue
out
You
got
no
hitters,
you
might
be
pitchin'
a
shut
out
She
'bout
to
give
up
the
dug
out
I
should
just
live
in
a
nut
house
Right
now,
I
live
in
an
igloo
(Yeah)
And
I'm
not
chillin'
the
fuck
out
Treat
you
like
a
stepparent,
does
to
a
stepchild
with
red
hair
and
Plus
I
get
dough
like
Ed
Sheeran,
so
call
me
the
ginger
bread
man
I'm
a
stan
of
Redman,
X-Clan
and
I'm
a
Treach
fan
But
I
look
up
to
myself
(Yeah)
Like
a
fucking
headstand
(Yeah)
So
why,
w-w-why
else,
would
I
call
myself
an
alien
How
could
I
hit
a
dry
spell
(Yeah),
I'm
named
after
the
wet
lands
I'm
Marsh
and,
I'm
out
this
world
(This
world)
S
on
my
chest
(Superman)
like
it's
plural
Call
me
extra,
extra
terrestrial
Extra,
extra,
extra
terrestrial
My
name
is
Marsh
and,
my
name
is,
my
name
is
My
name
is
Marsh
I
could
be
with
anybody,
I
choose
you
Still,
it's
no
excuse
to
abuse
you
But
no
one
knows
what
I'm
goin'
through,
so
I
used
you
To
be
truthful,
I
wouldn't
know
what
to
do
if
I
lose
you
So
I
refuse
to,
might
have
a
screw
loose
and
a
fuse
blew
But
I
think
I
might
be
buildin'
up
a
tolerance
to
you
'Cause
one
minute
I'm
hollerin',
"Screw
you"
Next
I
take
it
back,
guess
you
can
say
I'm
tryna
unscrew
you
But
the
shit's
about
to
pop
off,
yeah,
I
feel
you
up
Then
I
got
you
totally
open
as
soon
as
I
take
your
top
off
You're
so
hard
to
resist,
you
knock
my
socks
off
My
friends
say
you're
bad
for
me,
hogwash
I'll
never
love
again
The
way
I
loved
you
Did
you
find
someone
new?
Are
you
doin'
this
with
them?
'Cause
I
remember
when
Still
remember
when
you
was
mine,
yeah
We
were
inseparable
at
one
time,
yeah
You
know
my
love
for
you
was
undying,
yeah
You
used
to
always
have
my
back
Some
days
it
feels
like
you're
all
that
I
have
That's
why
I'm
tryna
hold
onto
you
for
as
long
as
I
can
And
you
just
want
me
for
my
money
so
I
got
you
wrapped
all
in
saran
Damn,
talk
about
eatin'
out
the
palm
of
my
hand
But
if
not
for
my
financials
I
wouldn't
have
you
anyways,
there
have
been
ample
Plenty
days,
where
I'm
just
in
a
daze
and
I
can't
pull
Myself
up
out
this
rut
and
you're
so
much
of
a
handful
I
can
only
take
so
much
of
you
all
at
one
time
Because
too
much
of
you's
just
too
much
to
swallow
sometimes
Gotta
take
you
in
doses,
but
when
you're
not
at
my
side
I
shake
in
convulsions,
separation
anxiety
'cause
we
may
be
the
closest
Yeah,
baby
we
hopeless,
don't
we
make
an
atrocious
Combination?
We
know,
it's
like
playin'
with
explosives
Quite
dangerous
though,
but
my
brain's
in
hypnosis
Such
a
wide
range
of
emotions
Migraines,
but
why
the
fuck
am
I
takin'
these
MOTRINs?
Ibuprofens,
like
a
drop
of
rain
in
the
ocean
And
you're
my
fix
on
the
days
when
I'm
broken
But
the
shit's
about
to
go
sideways,
I
just
know
it
I'll
never
love
again
The
way
I
loved
you
Did
you
find
someone
new?
Are
you
doin'
this
with
them?
'Cause
I
remember
when
Still
remember
when
you
was
mine,
yeah
We
were
inseparable
at
one
time,
yeah
You
know
my
love
for
you
was
undying,
yeah
You
used
to
always
have
my
back
So
I
spiral
downwardly
'cause
I'm
too
cowardly
to
leave
you
Head
is
clouded
in
a
fallacy,
but
in
reality
Somehow
it
seems
like
when
I
lay
me
down
to
sleep
I'm
counting
sheep
You're
bound
to
creak
'Cause
every
time
I
turn
around,
you
keep
runnin'
out
on
me
You're
my
Xanax
and
my
valium,
I'm
an
addict
you're
a
downer
You're
my
habit,
it's
like
I
found
you
in
the
cabinet
But
it's
like
I
can't
uncap
it
'cause
it's
childproof
A
scoundrel
and
fiends
how
I
feel
around
you
Awful,
every
time
I
lost
you,
felt
like
I
had
you
in
my
pocket
Now
I'm
flippin'
over
the
furniture,
punchin'
holes
in
the
walls
through
Everything
that
we've
gone
through
How
many
times
you've
fucked
me
But
the
way
it
felt
for
me
to
be
on
top
when
I
was
on
you
Swore
my
fealty,
but
word
to
G.O.D
I
thought
you
loved
me,
but
you
tried
to
kill
me,
I'm
getting
off
you
Quit
callin'
for
me,
hard
proof's
how
I
respond
to
The
Ambien
and
Tylenols
too
Fuck
all
you
Fuckin'
bitch
We're
done
I
trust
that
everyone
is
enjoying
the
music
As
the
title
of
the
album
suggests
This
was
meant
for
your
listening
pleasure
While
you
are
being
done
in
Call
this
evil
intent,
like
me
in
a
limo
(Yeah)
Like
the
shade
in
these
windows
Smoke
gray,
ladies
go
mental
But
no
way
they
can
see
in
though
(Nah)
OJ
blade
is
a
pencil
(Yeah)
Propane
takin'
my
cranium
Code-name
Titanium
Temper
I
almost
swallowed
my
car
I
call
my
Mercedes
a
Benzo
Bitch,
I
ball
like
a
baby
Ball
like
J,
but
not
Jaysin
Jay-Z,
J
as
in
Leno
’Cause
I
got
a
huge
mansion
No,
huge
man
chin,
new
Manson,
loose
cannon
Too
scandalous,
Sue
Atkins
The
kinda
crazy
you
can't
fix
I'm
still
the
one
your
parents
hate
I’m
in
your
house
eatin'
carrot-cake
While
I
sit
there
and
wait
and
I
marinate
I'm
irritated,
you
'bout
to
meet
a
scary
fate
And
come
home
to
find
yourself
starin'
straight
into
a
fuckin'
barrel
like
Sharon
Tate
Raise
the
concerto
while
I
narrate
Yeah,
you
be
on
the
straight
and
narrow
like
a
fuckin'
arrow
shape
I
be
on
a
higher
plane
in
aerospace
With
so
much
leg-room
and
air
space
on
this
airplane
Unlike
you
'cause
you’re
on
a
flight
too,
but
it’s
a
staircase
Now,
little
engine
gone,
finna
vrin-vrin

Little

I

Stop

stop
yellin'
I’m
not
yellin',
you're
yellin'
Smart
aleck,
goddammit
Fuck
is
that?
Stop
hammering
(God)
That's
what
it
sounds
like
in
my
brain
Much
as
I
fight
to
restrain
I
have
the
right
to
remain
violent
Any
rhyme
that
I
say
can
and
will
be
used
against
you
Icicle
veins,
mics
will
get
slain
Life
it
will
strangle
you
with
bicycle
chain
You're
gonna
have
to
come
identify
the
remains
Wait,

I
said
my
head
is
twisted
like
a
red
tie
(Yup)
Can't
get
a
fuckin'
word

(Shut

Success

"Marshall,

I

said,
"No,

She

Heard

You

a
slut
at
birth
If
the
world
had
a
dick
You'd
fuck
the
Earth
I
tried
to
get
over
you
It
doesn't
work
You're
still
a
cunt
I'm
still
a
fucking
jerk
Same
as
it
ever
was,
yeah
Say
it'll
change
but
it
never
does
Ain't
gonna
ever
'cause
You're
the
cause
of
my
pain
and
the
medicine
Never
met
someone
who
played
games
with
my
head
as
much
Fate
tethered
us
together
like
two
felons
Must've
fell
in
love
with
skeletons
Everyone's
got
'em,
thought
that
you
were
Cinderella
but
Feels
like
I
slept
with
the
wicked
stepmother
But
how
the
hell
am
I
Still
in
love
with
the
motherfucking
chick
there's
at
least
a
million
of
They
say
love
the
one
you
quit
But
this
shit
is
killing
us
I
lust
on
some
other
shit
I'm
a
glutton
for
punishment
You're
the
gloves,
I'm
the
punching
mitts
It's
above
and
beyond
us
Cuffing,
I'm
shoving
the
girl
I
love
inside
of
an
oven
If
I
catch
you
sucking
another
dick
You
better
unsuck
it,
you
snuck
in
the
crib
and
tried
to
jump
under
the
covers
again
Why
am
I
tucking
you
in?
Probably
'cause
I
gotta
tell
myself
another
lie
'Cause
that's
what
helps
to
get
me
by
'Cause
I'm
in
Hell
This
is
my
goodbye,
farewell
Wanna
hold
you,
wanna
choke
you,
wanna
love
you
Wanna
hate
you,
wanna
kill
you,
wanna
hurt
you
Wanna
heal
you,
yeah
Wanna
lose
you,
keep
you
bruised
You
be
the
abuse
you
treat,
you
mutual
It's
juvenile,
delusional,
it's
usual
You're
beautiful,
I'm
average
I'm
brutal,
you're
a
savage
My
ride
or
die
chick
who's
always
cruising
for
a
bruising
Yeah
it's
kinda
like
we're
tryna
light
a
dynamite
stick
Though
we
might
get
along
like
shit
Fight,
hit,
fight,
spit,
unite,
split
Yeah,
you're
awful,
but
you're
mine
And
they
say
love
is
blind,
we
see
each
other
fine
But
it's
no
wonder,
I'm
the
only
one
you'll
find
To
put
up
with
your
shit,
I
need
a
plumber
line
(Yeah)
But
nothing
comes
to
mind
besides
a
number
90
'Cause
since
'06
you
flipped
my
fucking
life,
upside
down
Now
the
sky's
ground,
look
at
my
frown,
it's
a
smile
now
Look
at
my
mouth,
it's
my
eyebrows,
make
it
rain
upwards
We're
on
the
ninth
cloud,
two
insane
lovebirds
I
should
fly
south,
'cause
man
am
I
great
and
land
in
myself
But
I'm
just
plain
stubborn,
I'm
outtie
five
thou'
But
this
is
my
house,
bitch
you
get
out
Then
we
duke
it
out,
then
it
dies
down
Then
we
say,
"Fuck
it",
cry
our
eyes
out
Then...
I
gotta
tell
myself
another
lie
'Cause
that's
what
helps
to
get
me
by
'Cause
I'm
in
Hell
This
is
my
goodbye,
farewell
This
relationship
is
all
that
it's
cracked
up
to
be
Never
lack
lust
in
that
'cause
we
act
nuts
'Cause
that's
what
attracts
us
Trick
you
with
a
back
rub
Tell
you
to
relax
then
dump
your
ass
in
the
bathtub
Yeah,
now
that's
love,
may
sound
pathetic
But
fuck
the
world
'cause
they
out
to
get
us
I
love
you
but
I
won't
exchange
vows
Hey
now,
don't
get
carried
away
No
way
I'll
get
married,
it'll
take
a
rain
cloud
to
wet
us
Yeah,
but
we're
so
insane
about
each
other
May
take
the
same
route
and
way
out
as
junior
stay
out
Break
out
Berettas
lay
down
in
bed
and
blow
our
brains
out
together
Who
knows
how
it's
gonna
play
out?
A
weathered
desk
where
our
ending
would
be
One
of
us
shot
in
the
back
while
attempting
to
flee
But
I
go
to
bat
for
you,
defending
your
honor
Yeah,
no
contingency
fees,
something
will
not
knock
We're
not
pretending
to
be,
don't
cost
a
penny
to
be
with
me
Time
we're
spending
is
free,
we
could
be
broke
as
a
joke
Won't
make
a
difference
to
me,
don't
have
to
give
me
a
thing
Could've
been
a
50
cent
ring
from
out
of
a
vending
machine
Love
unconditionally,
there's
no
other
fish
in
the
sea
Guess
I'm
a
prisoner
see,
addiction
is
a
disease
I
gotta
tell
myself
another
lie
'Cause
that's
what
helps
to
get
me
by
'Cause
I'm
in
Hell
This
is
my
goodbye,
farewell
Love
you
girl,
do
you
feel
the
same?
I
don't
wanna
play
games,
no
games,
ahh
You're
the
only
that
can
out
my
flame
Baby,
just
play
it
straight,
straight,
no
games,
ahh
(Oh,
oh,
yeah)
Yeah
You
know,
if
I
had
a
chance
to
do
it
all
over
again
(Oh,
oh)
I
wouldn't
change
shit
(Oh,
oh)
DA
got
that
dope
I'm
screamin'
out
no
regrets
You
been
through
the
hardest
spot,
it
go
the
largest,
I
made
you
a
star
(I'm
screamin'
out
no
regrets)
I
been
movin'
slowly,
tryna
play
it
low
the
'Vette
look
like
a
storm
(Screamin'
out
no
regrets)
Put
you
through
dumb
shit,
got
you
thinkin'
I
run
shit
(I
ain't
havin'
regrets)
I've
been
feeling
so
alone,
just
like
I'm
so
lost,
just
like
I'm
Yeah,
they
miss
the
old
me
I
think
they
want
me
to
OD
on
codeine
They
want
my
life
in
turmoil
like
in
'03
They
want
front
row
seats,
I
give
'em
nosebleeds
They
want
me
imploding,
exploding,
self-loathing,
eroding
I'm
screaming
at
'em
with
no
regrets
and
I'm
hulking
I'm
rippin'
out
of
my
clothing
I
had
to
go
see
the
doc
like
Kool
Moe
Dee
(Yeah)
Never
took
much
to
convince
Dre
Never
been
swayed
by
color
or
skin
shades
Since
day
one,
Hellraiser
with
twin
blades
of
a
sensei
Givin'
up,
no
comprende
(Woo)
Tin
brain,
prolly
fucked
in
the
membrane
Slim
Sha—
minds
of
a
God,
I
been
insane
Pen
game
like
I
just
struck
in
the
tenth
frame
(Screamin'
out
no
regrets)
Yeah,
I
live
on
the
edge,
I
sit
on
the
ledge
To
shit
on
your
heads,
I
been
on
the
bench
Forgive
and
forget
is
the
only
thing
I'd
ever
live
to
regret
Hell
bent
on
revenge,
you
left
me
for
dead
I
crawled
out
my
grave,
you
better
be
ready
and
set
My
enemies
ain't
put
an
end
to
me
yet
(I'm
screamin'
out
no
regrets)
You
been
through
the
hardest
spot,
it
go
the
largest,
I
made
you
a
star
(I'm
screamin'
out
no
regrets)
I
been
movin'
slowly,
tryna
play
it
low
the
'Vette
look
like
a
storm
(Screamin'
out
no
regrets,
yeah,
no
apologies,
I
ain't
takin'
shit
back)
Put
you
through
dumb
shit,
got
you
thinkin'
I
run
shit
(I
ain't
havin'
regrets)
I've
been
feeling
so
alone,
just
like
I'm
so
lost,
just
like
I'm
so
lost
(Yeah)
All
the
hate,
can't
tell
exactly
where
it
stems
from
But
it's
happening
again,
huh?
Y'all
used
to
be
in
my
corner
Now
you
just
backed
me
in
one
Innocent
bystanders,
I'm
bound
to
hit
some
For
some
adversaries,
I
carry
big
guns
So
some
targets'll
get
the
kill
shot
Some,
I
just
barely
nicked
'em
I
can
make
a
mistake
and
erupt
and
end
up
takin'
a
dump
Or
sayin'
some
dumb
shit,
thinkin'
I
run
shit
Misplacin'
my
anger
enough
to
give
Earl
and
Tyler,
The
Creator
the
brunt
Shoulda
never
made
a
response
to
the
disdain
for
the
fake
ones
Them
traitorous
punks,
'cause
snakes
are
just
cunts
They
can
get
fucked
with
eight
hundred
motherfuckin'
vibrators
at
once
And
for
any
of
those
who
may
have
come
close
to
about
dyin'
And
can't
listen
to
"Arose"
without
cryin'
For
those
who
feel
low
like
you're
'bout
spiralin'
But
this
is
only
for
those
that
I'm
inspirin'
Weapon
never
unholstered
without
firin'
My
will
I'm
imposin',
foes
are
gonna
feel
like
they're
in
the
throes
of
a
mountain
lion
They
talk
about
my
daughters
hopin'
I
fly
off
of
the
handle
'Cause
my
first
thought
is
to
trample
and
write
a
thousand
bars
But
sometimes
it's
like
dropping'
an
anvil
on
a
house
of
cards
Or
Godzilla
squashin'
a
crouton
with
combat
boots
on
Or
droppin'
a
goddamn
nuke
bomb
on
top
of
an
ant
hill
(I'm
screamin'
out
no
regrets)
Can't
do
it,
nah
You
been
through
the
hardest
spot,
it
go
the
largest,
I
made
you
a
star
(I'm
screamin'
out
no
regrets,
took
it
all)
I
been
movin'
slowly,
tryna
play
it
low
the
'Vette
look
like
a
storm
(Screamin'
out
no
regrets,
yeah,
no
regrets
though,
no
white
flags
either)
Put
you
through
dumb
shit,
got
you
thinkin'
I
run
shit
(I
ain't
havin'
regrets,
yeah)
I've
been
feeling
so
alone,
just
like
I'm
so
lost,
just
like
I'm
And
I
don't
think
that
I
can
stop
it
(Here
it
comes)
I
do
my
best
to
try
to
block
it
(Redrum)
I've
been
sipping
on
like,
vodka
(Head's
numb)
I'm
blacking
out,
you
better
watch
it
(It's
bedlam)
I
thought
I
heard
a
voice
in
my
head
that
said
"Kill"
I
had
no
other
choice
that
was
left
except
fill
My
pencil
full
of
poisonous
lead,
the
devil
He
wants
me
to
murder
this
beat,
so
I
will
He
told
me
there
are
doubters
who
question
my
skill
They
wanna
put
my
style
to
the
test,
am
I
still
The
best?
They
want
the
crown
on
my
head,
I
said,
"Chill
If
you
want
me
to
murder
this
beat,
then
I
will"
I'm
a
long
way
away
from
where
you
are
in
skill
Foreign
wheels,
my
bitch
wearin'
four
inch
heels
She
on
the
orange
pill
And
she
about
to
start
taking
off
layers
like
orange
peels
Sacha
Baron
Cohen,
Farrell,
where
am
I
going
with
this?
Oh
yeah,
a
bar
at
will
And
when
you
throw
the
iron
in
it,
I'm
all
that
still
The
truth
for
real,
I'm
real
truth,
call
that
treal
This
is
my
house,
this
place
is
mine
Posted

You

I
had
no

that
was
left
except
fill
My

He

He

They

I

"Chill
If

I

Yeah,
slaughter
goons
under
the
moonlight
John
Wilkes,
that's
who
I'm
in
the
booth
like
Abra—
I
go
ham
for
dead
presidents
And
everything
I
record
is
over
your
head
like
a
boom
mic
Why
would
you
irrelevant
fucks
want
to
rebel
against
us
Knowing
your
Smith
&
Wesson
has
never
been
clutched?
Knowing
you
never
been
rushed
by
the
most
ignorant
niggas
invented
The
nigga
gotta
send
you
to
the
dentist
to
get
a
whole
row
of
elephant
tusks
Your
teeth
gone
like
you
been
on
some
meth
and
some

forever
I
see
you,
my

call
me
the

watcher
The
minute
we
spot
ya,
the
semi'll
pop,
nigga,
we
got
ya
I'm
livin'
to
conquer,
remember
the
mantra,
I'm
grippin'
the
launcher
Like
Eminem-Dr.
with
no
guilty
conscience
I'm
still
shockin'
like
droppin'
a
boombox
in
bathwater
More
shockin'
than
a
pissed
off
Blanka
I
just
finished
fuckin'
a
fish
called
Wanda
I'm
finna
wander
off
into
yonder
Beyond
just
mentally
stronger,
memory
monster
I
remember
the
sponsorin'
thought
that
conquered
his
triple
entendre
You
the
cross
of
a
unicorn
and
The
Unabomber
Quit
horsin'
around
in
this
building
or
you
a
goner
Your
Willy
Wonka
persona
won't
help
you
any
longer
I'm
Optimus,
I
make
prime
examples
of
mini-Tonkas
Hogtie
your

and
go
bonkers
Spin,
grab
Denaun's
guitar
and
Honky
Tonk
ya
Oh,
your
boss
on
par
like
good
golfers?
I
put
a
hole
in
one
of
you
birdies
with
this
Eagle
and
launch
it
(Pew)
I
thought
I
heard
a
voice
in
my
head
that
said
"Kill"
I
had
no
other
choice
that
was
left
except
fill
My
pencil
full
of
poisonous
lead,
the
devil
He
wants
me
to
murder
this
beat,
so
I
will
He
told
me
there
are
doubters
who
question
my
skill
They
wanna
put
my
style
to
the
test,
am
I
still
The
best?
They
want
the
crown
on
my
head,
I
said,
"Chill
If
you
want
me
to
murder
this
beat,
then
I
will"
Now
this
will
probably
be
the
most
illest
shit
that
I've
ever
said
God
bless
the
dead
and
let
Biggie
possess
the
pencil
lead
They
called
me
a
sped
and
said
that
I
had
a
messed
up
head
'Cause
I
said
motherfuck
school
and
instead
went
to
special
ed
Sippin'
Bacardi
and
lime
I
start
to
recollect
on
the
time
That
I
startled
my
mom
and
had
her
scared
to
death
Word
to
Method
Man
She
heard
some
Wu-Tang
coming
from
towards
the
patio
She
was
like,
"What
the
heck
was
that?"
She
went
to
check
on
the
noise
and
go
inspect
the
deck
Then
I
jumped
out
with
a
sword
and
yelled,
"Protect
your
neck"
Now
bow
to
the
Lord,
hold
up,
no,
better
yet,
kneel
Better
yet,
get
down
on
all
fours
and
take
a
vow
to
always
Rejoice
in
the
sound
of
my
voice,
bitch,
you
don't
have
a
choice
Just
a
third
of
my
will
will
overpower
yours
Using
about
a
fourth
to
create
the
amount
of
force
It'll
take
to
knock
out
a
horse
like
a
tranq
full
of
Tylen—
or
Enter
my
house
of
whores
with
a
thousand
floors
Got
a
crown
of
thorns,
but
it
won't
fit
around
the
horns
But
I'ma
keep
it
a
buck
like
a
dollar
store
I'm
more
than
you
bargained
for
and
I
am
far
more
worse
Than
a
fourty-some
bar
Lord
Jamar
verse
Nothing
means
more
than
respect,
so
when
I
curse
You
could
say
I
swore
to
protect
My
image
I
have
zero
time
or
regard
for
I
never
was,
been
claiming
rap
when
it's
not
yours
If
it
was
anyone's
house
G
Rap
and
Rakim
would
be
havin'
you
mop
floors
Run-DMC
would
be
havin'
you
cleanin'
sinks
Yeah,
your
group
was
off
the
chain,
but
you
were
the
weakest
link
Rest
of
these
youngins
of
mine
Time
to
start
throwing
some
shade,
this
time
I'm
shutting
the
blinds
'Cause
when
I'm
looking
at
y'all,
shit,
it's
no
wonder
it's
why
I
need
a
visor,
'cause
y'all
are
just
suns
in
my
eyes
Born
a
cynic
and
more
demented
than
an
orphanage
with
a
morgue
up
in
it
Next
door
to
an
abortion
clinic
Newborn
infants
tortured
and
tormented
With
their
foreheads
dented
when
they
drop
'cause
the
floor's
cemented
Their
corpses
get
ornamented
The
corner
where
the
store
has
been
rented
To
store
them
in
and
the
torsos
of
forty
women
reported
missin'
Distorted,
twisted,
this
isn't
no
storybook
ending
This
is
only
the
beginning
So
Lord
forgive
me,
I'm
hearing
voices
I
can't
ignore
them
anymore,
they're
winning
I
thought
I
heard
a
voice
in
my
head
that
said
"Kill"
I
had
no
other
choice
that
was
left
except
fill
My
pencil
full
of
poisonous
lead,
the
devil
He
wants
me
to
murder
this
beat,
so
I
will
He
told
me
there
are
doubters
who
question
my
skill
They
wanna
put
my
style
to
the
test,
am
I
still
The
best?
They
want
the
crown
on
my
head,
I
said,
"Chill
If
you
want
me
to
murder
this
beat,
then
I
will"
And
I
don't
think
that
I
can
stop
it
(Here
it
comes)
I
do
my
best
to
try
to
block
it
(Redrum)
I've
been
sipping
on
like,
vodka
(Head's
numb)
I'm
blacking
out,
you
better
watch
it
(It's
bedlam)
Black
magic,
night
walker
(Yeah)
She
haunts
me
like
no
other
(Feel
like)
Nobody
told
me
(I
don't
know)
love
is
pain,
oh
(I
know
we
just
met)
Black
magic,
dark
water
(But
it's
like)
Surrounds
me
like
no
other
(It's
like
I
know
you
better
than
anyone)
She's
got
my
heart
in
chains
We're
volatile,
I
can't
call
it,
though
It's
like
too
large
a
peg,
and
too
small
a
hole
(Yeah)
But
she
cheats
and
I
catch
her
like
the
common
cold
(Sneeze)
Last
time
I
broke
her
collar
bone,
she's
intolerable
(Yeah)
All
I
know
is
that
the
sex
is
phenomenal,
though
We're
an
unlikely
pair
(Yeah)
Like
two
different
Nike
Airs
But
I'm
the
same
size
she
wears
(Jordans)
So
I
think
we're
soulmates
though
(Yeah)
People
don't
like
us
together
but
like
we
care
(Not
me,
not
me)
Yeah,
but
God
strikes
me
dead
(Yeah)
She
knows
that
I
would
walk
over
hot
coals
for
her
with
both
of
my
feet
bare
(Yeah)
As
soon
as
I
asked
to
hit
(Asked
to
hit),
it's
like
she
grabs
a
switch
(Grabs
a
switch)
Turns
me
over
her
knee,
as
my
ass
is
whipped
Yeah,
and
I
got
her
back,
but
I'm
spineless
(Yeah)
So
when
she
stabs
me
in
mine
(Yeah),
it's
like
I
just
can't
feel
the
nitrous
(What?)
She
pokes,
stabs,
and
then
slices
One
minute
she'll
build
me
up
(Up)
The
next,
she'll
push
me
'round
Probably
watchin',
calls
me
"Dumbbell"
She
lifts
me
up
(Yeah),
then
puts
me
down
(Huh)
But
I
am
under
her
thumbnail
I
must
be
under
her
spell
It's
like
lookin'
right
into
a
gun
barrel
But
none
of
these
hoes
can
fuck
with
my
girl
She
got
that
Black
magic,
night
walker
She
haunts
me
like
no
other
Nobody
told
me
love
is
pain,
oh
Black
magic,
dark
water
Surrounds
me
like
no
other
She's
got
my
heart
in
chains
We
wake
up,
break
up,
make
up
Like
Maybelline,
now
she's
all
made
up
like
make
believe
Probably
why
she's
so
fake
to
me
But
what
the
fuck's
it
gonna
take
for
me
to
make
her
see?
Strip
her
naked
and
take
her
keys
I
been
plannin'
this
thing
for
weeks
but
I
can't
tell
if
I'm
wake
or
sleep
But
if
this
is
actually
happenin',
sucker
for
pain
I'm
stuck
in
this
radioactive
pattern
But
hurt
by
her
motherfuckin'
hairs
All
I
imagine,
dragon
She
lunges,
attacks,
and
scratches
But
I
ain't
gonna
stand
for
that
shit
Like
Kaep
for
the
National
Anthem
As
I
stab
'em,
laughin'
So
much
for
witchcraft
and
magic
Abracadabra
that
bitch
No
turnin'
back,
I'm
blackin'
As
I
say
farewell
to
love
of
my
life,
I
cut
and
I
slice
I
give
her
one
last
hug,
goodbye
Wipe
the
blood
off
my
butterfly
knife
Watch
her
fuckin'
die
right
in
front
of
my
eyes
But
in
hindsight,
think
I
just
wanted
to
see
what
her
insides
look
like
As
I
pop
another
five
Vic's
That's
what
this
high's
like
Look
down,
there's
blood
on
my
knife
Shovel
at
my
side,
blood
on
my
mic
Now
wake
up
to
music
to
be
murdered
by
Like...
Before
I
check
the
mic
(Check,
check,
one,
two)
I
give
it
an
extra
swipe
with
a
Lysol
disinfectant
wipe
(Good
evening)
Coronavirus
in
effect
tonight
Antiseptics
on
deck,
I
got
every
type
(Yeah)
I
throw
on
my
tux,
then
I
(Yeah)
give
zero
fucks,
then
I
(Yeah)
Act
like
a
jockstrap
(Uh),
cup
my
nuts,
then
I
(Yeah)
Check
my
ball
hair
(What?),
make
sure
it's
all
there
(Yeah)
Then
call
the
pallbearer
(Yeah)
It's
Music
to
Be
Murdered
By
again,
why
stop?
Overkill
like
a
pipe
bomb
in
your
pine
box
You're
all
hitched
to
my
cock
(What?)
Went
from
punchin'
a
time
clock
to
getting
my
shot
Then
treated
it
like
a
cyclops
Like
it's
the
only
one
I
got
And
my
thoughts
are
like
nines
cocked
(Chk-chk)
Every
line's
obscene,
pervertedest
mind,
got
the
dirtiest
rhyme
stocked
That's
why
there's
parental
advising
every
time
I
drop
So
throw
on
the
theme
to
Alfred,
I'll
channel
him
like
the
Panama
Canal
But
how
could
I
get
up
in
arms
about
you
saying
trash
is
all
that
I
put
out?
Bitch,
I
still
get
the
bag
when
I'm
putting
garbage
out
Plus,
the
potty
mouth,
I'm
not
about
to
wash
it
out
The
filthiest,
so
all
this
talk
about
"I'm
washed
up",
how
preposterous
Because
if
cleanliness
is
next
to
godliness
It's
obvious
that
it's
impossible
for
me
to
be
beside
myself
And
I'm
'bout
that
capital
like
a
proper
noun
Still
on
top
the
pile
Got
me
sitting
on
numbers
like
a
pocket
dial
Quick
to
call
you
out
on
your
bullshit
Don't
make
me
give
that
crock
a
dial
'Cause
if
I
do,
it's
see
you
later,
alligator
Made
it
out
the
trailer,
then
I
made
a
vow
to
cater
to
no
one
So
hate,
I've
gained
about
the
same
amount
that's
in
my
bank
account
So
here's
some
more
shit
for
you
to
complain
about,
I
say
the
Bars
that
never
slack,
but
always
get
attacked
(Yeah)
I
think
they're
gunnin'
for
me,
it's
startin'
to
feel
like
that
Like
I'm
marked,
'cause
when
I
rap,
it's
like
fallin'
on
my
back
in
a
tar
pit
'Cause
I
have
this
target
on
my
back
(Ew,
yuck)
But
if
I
ever
double-crossed
my
fans
and
lost
my
Stans
I'd
probably
pop
five
Xans
(Yeah)
Go
in
my
garage,
start
my
van
Inhale
as
much
carbon
monoxide
and
exhaust
I
can
And
doze
off
like
*snores*,
but
odds
like
that
with
these
thoughts
I
have's
Like
a
giant
getting
squashed
by
ants
If
this
is
the
test
of
time,
I'd
pass
with
flying
colors
Like
I
just
tossed
my
crayons
(Tossed
my
crayons)
Small,
medium,
and
large
size
cans
Sanitizers
of
all
types,
brands,
cost
nine
bands
Which
is
a
small
price
for
Lysol
wipes
and
If
my
palms
brush
across
my
pants,
I
wash
my
hands
Shit,
hold
on,
man
Motherfucker
Happy
birthday
to
Fuck
(Shh,
quiet)
I
sit
in
silence
in
candlelit
environments
Sipping
Wild
Irish
while
getting
violent
Homicidal
visions
when
I'm
spitting
like
this
But
really
I'm
just
fulfilling
my
wish
of
killing
rhymes
Which
is
really
childish
and
silly,
but
I'm
really
like
this
I'm
giving
nightmares
to
Billie
Eilish,
I'm
Diddy's
side
bitch
What
the
fuck?
Hold
on,
wait
"I'm
Diddy's
side
bitch"?
Oh,
I'm
still
east
side,
bitch
So
until
the
E-N-D,
since
EPMD
Been
givin'
y'all
the
business
(Yeah),
D.R.E
and
me
(Yup)
From
the
MMLP
to
MTBMB
(Bitch)
Bitch,
it's
2020,
you
still
ain't
seein'
me
(Haha)
So
call
me
Santa
Clause
(Santa
Clause)
'Cause
at
the
present
(Yeah),
I
out-rap
'em
all,
I'm
at
the
mall
Got
your
bitch
in
a
bathroom
stall,
she
could
suck
a
basketball
(Uh)
Through
a
plastic
straw
(Yeah)
with
a
fractured
jaw
(Damn)
My
dick
is
coat
check
(Ha),
she
wanna
jack
it
off
(Yeah)
I'm
so
far
past
the
bar,
I
should
practice
law
Mentally,
I'm
fucked
up
generally
(Duh)
Dukes
of
Hazzard
car,
get
the
cadaver
dogs
'Cause
this
is
murder,
murder
and
you'll
get
murked,
murked
This
music
'bout
to
kill
you,
brr,
brr
(Brr)
This
chicken
hit
my
phone,
she
said,
"Chirp,
chirp"
I
said,
"Hut,
hut,
hike
your
skirt,
skirt"
Then
go
eat
some
worms,
like
the
early
bird
What
the
fuck
is
love?
That's
a
dirty
word
Make
me
fall
in
it,
there's
not
a
girl
on
Earth
Or
any
other
planet,
that's
a
world
of
hurt
And
I
won't
buy
a
designer,
'cause
I
don't
pander
But
I'm
back
with
so
many
knots,
I
need
a
chiropractor
(Damn)
And
this
the
final
chapter,
'cause
I'm
either
frying
after
Or
they
gon'
give
me
the
needle
(What?)
like
a
vinyl
scratcher
Yeah,
I'm
a
card,
like
Hallmark
At
Walmart
with
a
small
cart
buying
wall
art
And
y'all
who
claim
to
be
dogs
aren't
No
bite
like
a
tree
mostly
just
all
bark,
arf,
arf
But
y'all
pickin'
the
wrong
tree,
they
call
me
dog
because
I'm
barking
(Bark,
bark,
bar
king)
And
I
got
a
lot,
yeah,
like
where
cars
park
I'd
describe
it
as
bowling
(Why?)
ball
hard
(Ball's
hard)
'Cause
the
gutter's
where
my
mind
is
and
when
It's
in
this
frame,
better
split
like
the
five
and
the
ten
'Cause
without
a
second
to
spare,
I'm
strikin'
again
And
when
the
beat
is
up
my
alley,
I
go
right
for
the
pens
The
cypher
begins
I'm
talkin'
smack
like
heroin,
the
mic's
a
syringe
It's
like
a
binge,
Vicodin,
I
would
liken
to
tin
My
mind
is
a
recycling
bin
There's
no
place
I
never
been
But
I
never
budge
and
I
never
bend
You
hyperextend
on
me,
this
game's
life,
it
depends
Like
adult
diapers
for
men
Even
when
I'm
rappin'
less
stellar
It's
sour
grapes,
I
still
whine,
I'm
the
best
seller
Like
a
trey
deuce,
spray
you
as
these
shots
penetrate
through
Dre's
booth
And
go
straight
through
your
grapefruit,
no
escape
route
So
you
won't
leave
here
just
scathed
with
a
few
scrape
wounds
Your
ass
is
grass
and
I
am
not
gonna
graze
you
But
if
bar's
were
semi-mac's,
I'd
be
the
Mad
Hatter
'Cause
I
got
so
many
caps,
and
you
don't
have
any
straps
(Nah)
So
you'd
be
a
fitted
(Yeah),
so
don't
act
like
you
fittin'
to
snap
Bitch,
I'll
pee
on
your
head,
like
a
Phillies
hat
(Haha)
No
stoppin'
me,
you're
on
a
window
shopping
spree
Bitch,
you
probably
go
broke
at
the
Dollar
Tree
You
never
buy
shit,
all
you
ever
cop's
a
plea
You're
always
punkin'
out
like
Halloween
You
rather
opt
to
flee,
you
need
to
stop
it,
punk
Homie,
you're
not
a
G,
act
like
you
got
the
pump
You're
gonna
cock
the
heat
or
get
the
Glock
and
dump
Bitch,
if
you
shot
a
tree,
you
wouldn't
pop
the
trunk
Yeah,
and
I'm
buddies
with
Alfred,
we
about
to
Disembowel
them,
gut
'em
and
scalp
'em,
yeah
This
is
'bout
to
be
the
bloodiest
outcome
'Cause
we
gon'
make
you
bleed
with
every
cut
from
this
album
So
I'm
choppin'
'em
up
like
Dahmer
The
nut
job
with
the
nuts
that
are
bigger
than
Jabba
the
Hutt
I'm
in
the
cut,
and
I'm
out
for
the
blood
It's
lookin'
like
it's
that
time
of
the
month
Carvin'
'em
up
with
the
bars
while
I
sharpen
'em
up,
dog
and
a
mutt
I'm
gonna
fuck
your
mom
in
the
butt
with
a
thermometer,
fuckin'
phenomenal,
but
Y'all'll
get
cut
the
fuck
up
like
abdominals
if
you
don't
vámonos
I
keep
droppin'
like
dominos,
the
formidable,
abominable
Stompin'
a
mudhole
in
my
comp
even
if
it's
off
the
top
of
the
dome
Son
'em,
get
the
Coppertone,
I'm
at
the
Stop
and
Go
coppin'
the
Mop
and
Glo
Got
your
stomach
in
knots
like
you
swallowed
rope
You
out
of
pocket
though,
like
a
motherfuckin'
wallet
stole
Wait,
why'd
the
beat
cut
off?
Fuck
it
Yeah,
I'm
sorry
(Huh?)
What
did
you
say?
Oh,
I
can't
hear
you
I
have
an
ear
infucktion
and
I
cunt
finger
it
out
(Out,
haha)
(I
need
auto
tune)
Yeah
It's
my
alter-ego's
fault,
these
evil
thoughts
can
be
so
dark
Cerebral
palsy,
three
Zolofts
I
eat
those
off
to
Rico
Suave,
look
it
up
Cadillac
with
a
ladder
rack
in
the
back,
with
a
cracked
axel
A
backpack
full
of
Paxil
A
black
satchel,
a
nap
sack
and
a
flask
full
of
'gnac
and
Jack
Daniels
Girl,
let's
go
back,
back
to
my
castle
(Yeah)
I
don't
wanna
hassle
you,
Alexandra
But
my
dick's
an
acronym
'cause
it
stands
for
you
(Oh)
You,
wait,
Alexandra
who?
(Damn)
All
I
know
is
Friday,
I
met
you
(What?)
Saturday,
I'll
probably
forget
you
Guess
that's
what
the
Molly
and
X
do
(What
the
fuck?)
'Cause
who
the
fuck
am
I
laying
next
to?
(Eh)
But
ever
since
D-Nice
"To
tha
Rescue"
Feel
a
fresh
crew
(Uh),
been
a
lab
rat
(Yeah)
From
a
test
tube
(Uh),
I'm
goin'
in
like
the
red
roof
(Red
Roof
Inn)
You
don't
like
it,
eat
a
cock
'til
your
jaw
breaks
Call
it
caught
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place
Like
a
sasquatch
in
a
crawlspace
'Cause
you're
watching
your
heart
race
like
you're
Scarface
In
a
car
chase
with
the
cops
or
an
arcade
Stuck
inside
of
a
Mario
Kart
race,
stuck
in
saw
blades
At
a
stop
and
a
start
pace
What
I'm
tryin'
to
say
is,
I'm
drivin'
'em
all
crazy
I
can't
understand
a
word
you
say
(I'm
tone
deaf)
I
think
this
way
I
prefer
to
stay
(I'm
tone
deaf)
I
won't
stop
even
when
my
hair
turns
grey
(I'm
tone
deaf)
'Cause
they
won't
stop
until
they
cancel
me
(Yeah,
yeah)
I
see
the
rap
game
then
attack
the
verses
(Uh)
Turn
into
a
graveyard
packed
with
hearses
(Yeah)
Just
like
your
funeral,
I'm
at
your
service
(What?)
Pockets
on
stuffed
like
a
taxidermist
(Woo)
Just
landed
in
Los
Angeles
when
this
chick
Angela
and
her
grandmother
in
a
tan
Colored
van
pulled
up
with
a
hand
full
of
Xans
And
a
substantial
amount
of
ganja,
just
to
ask
what
my
Plans
for
the
night
are
(Yeah)
I
said
sneakin'
to
the
Sleep
Inn
for
the
weekend
and
pretend
it's
a
five
star
Yeah,
I
leap
into
the
deep
end
of
the
pool,
I
can
show
you
where
the
dives
are
We
don't
even
gotta
drive
far
I
know
this
spot
that
is
so
live,
but
I'm
tryna
get
some
head
first,
like
a
nose
dive
(Haha)
So
many
side
chicks,
can't
decide
which
to
slide
with
and
which
should
I
ditch
So
when
it
comes
to
ass,
bitch,
I
get
behind
like
the
Heimlich
(Yeah)
Had
one
chick
who
liked
to
flip
sometimes
on
some
switchin'
sides
shit
Pushed
her
out
the
side,
kicked,
then
I
flipped
The
lil'
white
bitch
off
like
a
light
switch
(Bitch)
It's
okay
not
to
like
my
shit
Everything's
fine,
drink
your
wine,
bitch
And
get
offline,
quit
whinin',
this
is
just
a
rhyme,
bitch
But
ask
me,
will
I
stick
to
my
guns
like
adhesive
tape?
Does
Bill
Cosby
sedate
once
he
treats
the
cheesecake
and
the
decent
steak?
You
think
gettin'
rid
of
me's
a
piece
of
cake?
I'm
harder
than
findin'
Harvey
Weinstein
a
date
(Haha)
And
that's
why
they
say
I
got
more
lines
than
Black
Friday
So
save
that
shit
for
the
damn
library
(Shh)
You
heard
of
Chris
Christophesen?
(Yeah)
Well,
I
am
piss
piss
off'ed-eson
(Oh)
Paul's
askin'
for
Christmas
off
again
I
said,
"No,"
then
I
spit
this
song
for
him,
it
goes:
I
can't
understand
a
word
you
say
(I'm
tone
deaf)
I
think
this
way
I
prefer
to
stay
(I'm
tone
deaf)
I
won't
stop
even
when
my
hair
turns
grey
(I'm
tone
deaf)
'Cause
they
won't
stop
until
they
cancel
me
(Yeah,
yeah,
yeah)
Bitch
I
can
make
an
orange
rhyme
with
banana,
oranana
Eating
pork
rinds,
sword
fightin'
in
pajamas
At
the
crib,
playin'
Fortnite
with
your
grandma
But
I'm
more
like
I'm
4'5"
with
the
grammar
Bitch,
'bout
to
show
you
why
your
five
favorite
rappers,
can't
touch
this
But
before
I
get
the
hammer,
I
should
warn
you
I'm
Thor-like
in
this
manner
But
the
day
I
lose
sleep
over
you
critiquin'
me
or
I
ever
let
you
cocksuckers
eat
at
me
I'd
need
to
be
a
motherfuckin'
pizzeria,
but
you
ain't
gettin'
no
cheese
from
me
I
went
from
Lil'
Ceasers,
BLT-ses,
grilled
cheeses
Bein'
dirt
poor
to
filthy
rich,
I'm
still
me,
bitch
Like
a
realtor,
it's
realty,
bitch
(Real
talk)
Aftermath,
bitch,
whole
camp's
lit
We
put
out
fire,
Dre
stamps
it
With
my
cohorts,
hit
up
Bogart
Yeah,
got
your
whole
squad
yellin',
"Oh,
God"
Here
comes
Marshall,
with
no
holds
barred
Bitch,
I'm
a
hurricane,
you're
a
blow
hard
Like
your
old
broad,
she
full
of
semen,
like
the
coast
guard
And
life's
been
pretty
good
to
me
so
far,
for
the
most
part
Had
a
couple
of
run-in's
with
popo,
caught
A
couple
assault
charges,
got
a
few
priors
like
crowbars
Which
is
so
odd
'cause
I'm
forty-eight
now
That
5-0's
startin'
to
creep
up
on
me
like
a
patrol
car
I'll
be
an
old
fart,
but
you
don't
want
no
part,
so
bitch,
don't
start
Simmer
down,
compose
yourself,
Mozart
I
ain't
went
nowhere,
call
me
coleslaw
'Cause
I'm
out
for
the
cabbage
and
I'm
so
raw
And
if
time
is
money,
you
have
no
clocks
And
any
folk
caught
within
close
proximity's
gettin'
Colt
cocked
My
enemies
I'm
a
chimney
give
me
the
smoke,
opps
And
R.I.P.
to
King
Von,
and
it
don't
stop,
and
I
know
not
What
the
fuck
you
say?
I
told
y'all,
it
ain't
me,
it's
my
alter-ego's
fault
But
if
y'all
wanna
cancel
me,
no
prob'
I'll
tell
you
the
same
thing
I
told
Paul
I
can't
understand
a
word
you
say
(I'm
tone
deaf)
I
think
this
way
I
prefer
to
stay
(I'm
tone
deaf)
I
won't
stop
even
when
my
hair
turns
grey
(I'm
tone
deaf)
'Cause
they
won't
stop
until
they
cancel
me
(I'm
tone
deaf)
I
don't
smile,
I
don't
frown,
get
too
up
or
get
too
down
(Nah)
I
was
here,
so
were
you,
you
came
and
went,
I
stuck
around
(Yeah)
Still
here
now,
stop
me
how?
Your
opinion's
like
a
broken
calculator,

Get

little
testy
whеn
I'm
mad
(I'm
mad),
sick
of
wrestling
this
iPad
(iPad)
Unsuccessfully,
I
might
add
And
I
know
it's
best
to
lеave
it
lie
But
even
I
get
obsessed
with
reading
everything
And
let
it
get
the
best
of
me
'til
I
snap
('Til

But
I

you
a

Why
you
waste
time
just
to
comment
on
shit?
(Comment
on
shit)
Especially
shit
you
don't
like
(Shit
you
don't

Don't
like

me
'bout
your
favorite
rapper
rippin'
some
shit
he
didn't
write
(Shit
he
didn't

What
happened
to
Slim?
He
was
no
cap
with
the
pen
He
used
to
rap
like
the
people
his
music
was
for
He
was
exactly
like
them
The
dude
used
to
be
poor,
why
can't
he
tap
into
him?
Can't
use
that
excuse
anymore
He's
mad
at
the
wind,
he's
in
a
nuclear
war
With
a
cloud,
he's
yellin'
at
it
again
I
talked
to
your
mother,
she
told
me
she
love
me
All
she
wanna
do
is
just
hold
me
and
hug
me
Wants
nobody
but
me,
she
showed
me
the
Dougie
Can
I
get
a
witness
like
notary
public?
(Preach)
She
said,
"Kick
some
fly
shit"
(Fly

I
said,
"I

(Wings

Sinful

crazy,
this
shit's
retarded
This
instru's
mental
(This

mental)
to
mini-bars,
incidental
charges
When
did
it
start?
I
been
cold-hearted
in
this
heart
since
kindergarten
Mental
sharpness
which
makes
Slim
a
walking
dentist
office,
bitch,
I
invented
flossin'
Yeah,
I
used
to

I

on
me
when
I'm

my
way

(I'm

My
floor
is
y'all
fool's
ceilings
If
I
was
you,
I
would
step
or
find
yourself
twisted
That's
how
you'll
wind
up
like
spiral
stairs
I
will
swear
on
a
stack
of
Bibles
I
will
tear
new
behinds
out
of
rivals,
even
your
idols,
I
don't
care
It's
Music
to
Be
Murdered
By,
so
Bon
Iver
can
swallow
a
fuckin'
Ja
Rule
bobblehead
And
die
slow
like
Alzheimer's
(Ha-ha)
Lone
sniper,
I
hold
a
microphone
like
a
loaded
rifle
My
dome's
brighter,
all
I
spit
from
my
skull's
fire
All
that's
missing's
a
motorcycle
with
the
chrome
wires,
spoke
tires
And
y'all
are
flow
biters,
so
I
don't
gotta
Explain
why
they
call
me
your
ghostwriter
I'm

(I'm

my
book
of
rhymes
(My

Get
'em

(Illa)
Haven't
used
all
the
tricks
I
have,
so
like
my
balls,
it's
in
my
bag
I
tend
to
get
a
little
testy
when
I'm
mad
But
gift
of
gab
and
pen
to
pad
turn
temper
tantrums
into
anthems
Put
lips
to
ass
and
kiss
the
cracks,
spit
your
damnedest
You're
still
gonna
hit
the
canvas
Rippin'
rappers,
veterans
to
whippersnappers
Mr.
Mathers

shit,
villainous
wit
with
scant
less
Syllables

the
planet,
biblical
shit's
finna
hit
the
fan
Anybody
wanna
go
tit
for
tat's
gonna
get
hit
with
that
Then
the
amygdala
hippocampus
is
gonna
trigger
the
ignoramus
To
think
of
the
most
ridiculous
shit
to
spit
then
Pin
it
against
these
pitiful
rappers
Insidious,
these
idiots
wittiest
shit
against
me
shitty
as
MC
Hammer's
Get
your
whole
squad,
send
a
task
force
in
If
you
want
it,
you're
'bout
to
get
what
you
asked
for
then
Put
your
helmet
on,
strap
your
chin
You're
'bout
to
get
you
a
crash
course
in
Who
not
to
start
a
motherfuckin'
rap
war
with
Or
to
go
against,
fuck
would
you
wanna
do
that
for?
No
offense,
but
are
you
retards
slow
or
dense?
A
fuckin'
penny
has
more
sense
Yeah,
now
you
gotta
get
killed,
but
it's
not
a
big
deal,
but
every
thought
is
so
ill
And
so
methodical,
thought
I
swallowed
a
pill
I'm
startin'
to
feel
like
I'm
an
automobile
With
Barnacle
Bill
inside
the
car
at
the
wheel
Inside
a
carnival,
'cause
I'm
plowin'
into
everyone
who
wrote
snidey
articles
And
that
explains
why
the
fuck
you
clowns
are
all
in
my
grill
Joy
and
pain,
fortune,
fame,
torture,
shame,
choice
I
made
Swore
someday
the
world
would
pay,
less
to
lose,
more
to
gain
Daughters
raised,
yesterday,
glory
days,
adored
and
praised
Ignore
the
hate,
address
the
fake
Toured
with
Dre,
tore
a
page
from
Jordan
King
Destroyed
the
game,
before
you
came,
enjoy
your
stay
Before
it's
gone
away,
but
the
more
you
claim
That
you're
gonna
point
and
aim
If
you
join
their
gang,
your
shit
isn't
goin'
to
bang
You're
just
boring,
lame
and
more
the
same
You
have
an
enormous
chain,
but
a
storm-less
brain
The
most
you
could
form
is
rain
Your
shit
is
pointless,
same
as
a
scoreless
game
So,
bitch,
quit
lyin',
you're
denyin'
like
Mr.
Porter's
name
Borderline
bipolar
disorder
since
my
stroller
Eyes
rollin'
back
in
my
skull
like
Eli
Porter
Fire
motor
(Brr),
rounds
I
told
to
every
iota
or
I
load
up
I
owe
to
my
motor,
mouth
This
is
my
note
to
self
Sometimes
you're
gonna
bomb
So
you
might
just
have
to
blow
yourself
up
with
no
one's
help
I
just
wrote
it
down
in
my
book
of
rhymes
Preemo,
take
us
out
Writin'
in
my
book
of
rhymes
My
book
of
rhymes,
my
book
of
rhymes
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm
eastside
Writin'
in
my
book
of
rhymes
My
book
of
rhymes,
my
book
of
rhymes
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm
eastside
Nah,
for
real,
you
know
what
I'm
sayin'?
Like
Like
music's
my
first
love,
right?
But
what
it
turned
into
is
like
You
know,
these,
these
cats
got
it
now,
she
just
like
a
ho
(They
ain't
doin'
it
now
to
make
music)
You
know
what
I
mean?
(Yeah)
It's
not
real
(Yeah)
Switched
it
up,
then
everybody—
Done
changed
the
shit
on
that
damn—
Yeah,
everybody
done
ran
through
it
Mumble
rappin'
Ain't
no
more
substance
in
shit
Right,
right
They
don't
treat
it
the
way
it
needs
to
be
treated
I
kinda
want
that
old
thing
back
Yeah,
I
was
young,
I
was
hungry
I
was
chasin'
the
bag
at
twenty-one,
I
was
lucky
To
find
an
unеaten
fucking
(What?)
honeybun
I
forgot
about
Now
I
got
money
falling
out,
fiftiеs,
hundreds,
and
twenties
(Twenties)
And
I
know
nothing
is
funny
'bout
the
Manchester
bombing
But
we
got
something
in
common
(What?),
both
of
us
are
alarming
Foul,
disgusting,
and
awful
(Yeah),
so
repugnant
and
ugly
(Yup)
I
could
give
the
Boston
Marathon
a
run
for
its
money,
yeah
And
you
could
say
I'm
a
little
bit
immature
But
this
type
of
literature
got
me
a
little
richer
But
I
get
insecure
when
them
other
dudes
hit
on
you,
girl
You're
letting
'em
fiddle
with
your
clitoris
Remember
you
were
my
fucking—
You
used
to
be
my
favorite
bitch
Things'll
never
be
the
same,
ain't
it
funny
how
you
changed
Up
and
flipped
the
script?
You
done
let
a
bunch
of
lames
fall
through
and
complain
That
I
can't
permit
You
ain't
have
to
do
it
like
that,
told
you
I'll
be
right
back
Look
what
you
did,
I
need
a
new
chick
Like
the
music,
I
had
to
bounce
on
my
favorite
bitch
Always
hated
my
smile
Mama
told
me
it's
goofy
I'd
get
picked
on
at
school
Come
home
and
she'd
school
me
She
never
sugarcoated
it
to
me
She
said
if
I
wasn't
so
stupid
and
ugly,
I
wouldn't
always
get
bullied
(True)
I
think
of
my
struggles
(Yeah)
and
get
emotional
Could
be
'cause
how
behind
the
eight-ball
and
far
in
the
hole
that
they
put
me
Now
I'm
on
a
roll
like
a
Tootsie
(Yeah)
I'm
just
trollin'
you
pussies
But
I'm
like
a
stroller
'cause
you'll
see
just
how
I
roll
if
you
push
me
But
that's
what
I
do
this
music
for
When
I
was
goin'
through
some
of
the
hardest
times,
I
drew
from
her
But
she's
like
the
devil
'cause
I
just
can't
let
loose
of
her
Plus
the
thought
of
losin'
her
makes
me
wanna
just
let
loose
on
her
Then
I
hit
the
studio,
tryna
rendezvous
with
her
Tell
her,
"It's
a
butt-dial
girl,"
yeah,
booty
call
(Haha)
That's
how
it
used
to
be,
'cause
you
and
me,
we
ruled
the
world
And
we
made
Curtis
blow
(Fifty)
Fuck,
I
miss
them
days
You
used
to
be
my
favorite
bitch
Things'll
never
be
the
same,
ain't
it
funny
how
you
changed
Up
and
flipped
the
script?
You
done
let
a
bunch
of
lames
fall
through
and
complain
That
I
can't
permit
You
ain't
have
to
do
it
like
that,
told
you
I'll
be
right
back
Look
what
you
did,
I
need
a
new
chick
Like
the
music,
I
had
to
bounce
on
my
favorite
bitch
You
fuckin'
leavin'
me,
bitch?
I
don't
think
so,
sit
your
motherfuckin'
ass
down
I
swear
to
God,
you
run
to
that
door
I'ma
put
one
in
the
back
of
your
fuckin'
head
I'ma
ask
you
this
one
time
And
the
answer
better
be,
"Yes"
Would
you
marry
me
again?
Now
that
everything
is
changed
(Yeah)
It'll
never
be
the
same
(Nah)
As
the
era
whence
we
came
(Who?)
From
Nas
to
Pac,
Rak'
(Yeah),
Eric
B.
and
Kane
(I
know)
But
I
know
a
few
from
this
era
that
are
lyrically
insane
And
although
most
are
never
gonna
hit
the
level
Cole
or
Weezy
at
Or
be
emotionally
attached
to
Yo
MTV
Raps
(Yeah)
Runnin'
home
from
school
to
catch
an
episode
The
feeling
that
it
gave
you
to
rip
the
plastic
off
the
tape
You
hold
and
peel
it
back,
yeah
Tear
it
off,
then
play
it
(What?)
I
swear
to
God,
four
o'clock
We'd
crowd
around
the
TV,
Butter
in
his
underwear
and
socks
When
Nani
was
Kon
Artis
(Yeah)
and
Proof
had
his
hair
in
locs
(Doody)
Yeah,
back
when
Flavor
Flav
had
us
wearing
clocks
(Back
when)
Back
when
Ed
Lover
(Yeah)
When
there
was
two
Dr.
Dre's,
that's
a
paradox
(Pair
of
Docs)
But
I
never
thought
I'd
get
so
jealous
At
the
thought
of
letting
you
go
psychologically
It's
gonna
bother
me,
my
eyes
are
already
watery
Part
of
me
don't
wanna
stop
(Yeah)
'til
I
get
you
back
'Cause
I
gotta
put
the
work
in
and
tell
you
I'm
never
givin'
this
up
Other
part
wants
to
tell
you
just
to
get
fucked
Go
back
to
whatever
dick
that
you
sucked
(Ah)
Get
back
together
with
them,
you
slut
Givin'
up
the
vagina
like
a
trip
to
the
gynecologist
When
I
helped
you
become
bigger
than
you
were
But
I
guess
that
it
slipped
your
mind,
you
must
be
biding
your
time
Looking
for
someone
to
come
along
that'll
make
you
feel
like
I
did
back
when
you
were
mine,
huh?
(Damn)
But
truthfully,
it
was
never
really
you
and
me
exclusively
And
there's
too
many
new
MC's
you
can
choose
between
But
no
matter
how
many
motherfuckers
ran
through
Bet
they
can't
do
it
like
me
But
I
can't
keep
burnin'
the
candle
at
both
ends
And
I
can't
handle
it
when
I
leave
and
you
find
another
one
Now
I
gotta
take
this
beat
and
dismantle
it
I
won't
grieve
when
I
kill
you
But
if
I
can't
have
you,
bitch,
nobody
can
Hear
me?
I
used
to
be
your
favorite,
bitch
It's
time
to
face
the
music
(Oh)
A
stay
of
execution
No
more
distribution
(The
fuck
you
doin'?)
You
did
this
to
me
I'm
right
back
on
my
bullshit,
right
back
out
on
these
streets
Just
remember
that
you
did
this
to
yourself
Yeah,
you
did
it
to
yourself
Now,
you
gotta
suffer
the
consequences
Pack
up
the
pack
and
swing
it
for
the
fences
(Just
remember
that)
Let's
make
one
thing
clear
(Here)
Here,
my
dear,
my
resolution
this
year
No
pollution,
fresh
air
My
solution,
long
hair
with
a
fat
ass,
I'm
deadass
Mile
high
club
'til
I
jetlag
Raw
stink,
flow,
casino
And
you're
just
like
Ginger,
we
know
Single
negro,
I
don't
need
your
double
standards
and
hypocrisy
And
that
fake
can
holder
on
Father's
Day
You
a
different
motherfucker
when
you
not
with
me
Been
sleepin'
with
the
enemy,
mockery
It's
like
I'm
John
F.
Kennedy,
shots
at
me
Yes,
I'm
President
of
Debauchery
None
of
that
bullshit
ever
got
to
me
'Cause
your
pillow,
billow,
ditto
Breakin'
this
shit
down
little
by
little
I
ain't
got
time
for
the
fuckin'
pom-poms
Shoulda
never
let
this
dog
out
of
that
kennel
Wastin'
time,
debatin'
'bout
Who
I'm
with
when
I'm
not
around
Just
don't
forget
who
you
fuckin'
with
When
steppin'
on
hallowed
ground
'Cause
you
did
this
to
me
(Yeah,
I'm)
Right
back
on
my
bullshit,
right
back
out
on
these
streets
Just
remember
that
you
did
this
to
yourself
(Yeah,
you
did
it
to
yourself)
Now,
you
gotta
suffer
the
consequences
(And
sorry
isn't
gonna
help)
Now
many
times
have
I
got
burnt
And
tried
to
act
like
I'm
not
hurt?
Or
take
you
back
and
we
not
workin'
Like
clockwork,
this
shit
is
agony
You're
draggin'
me,
Glocks
burst
Just
remember,
you
draw'd
first,
toe
taggin'
me
Ho
baggin'
it,
blowback
you
deserve
Get
the
bows,
axe,
bitch,
my
soul's
blackening
So
actually,
this
could've
been
a
lot
worse
(Watch)
I
could've
namedropped
you
in
my
verse
(Yeah)
But
out
of
respect
for
your
daughter
I
won't
blow
your
spot
up
'cause
your
toddler
Does
not
deserve
to
get
caught
up
in
our
dirt
(Yeah)
And
good
luck
with
the
father
Bitch
stuck
with
him
now,
ha,
fuckin'
Howard
To
the
doctor,
these
are
wounds
you
cannot
nurse
It's
drivin'
you
bonkers
that
I'm
not
yours
(Oh
no)
Guess
I
must
have
got
wise,
you
will
not
slide
Just
'cause
you
can
makeup
an
on
the
spot
lie
I'm
comin'
out,
guns
blazin',
shots
fired
Hey
Santa,
I
ain't
cuttin'
off
ties
Bitch,
everything
you
own's
in
a
box,
bye
Guess
it's
back
to
the
trailer
and
pot
pies
Hope
I
pull
up
to
the
window
at
Popeyes
One
day
and
you'll
be
servin'
me
hot
fries
(You
did
this
to
me)
A
taste
of
your
own
medicine,
you
shedded
skin
Yeah,
you
reptilian
bitch
Off
of
your
knees
(Yeah),
beggin'
for
forgiveness
Yeah,
look
at
you,
marry
him
again,
bitch
You
ain't
Em's
bitch,
you
just
regular
him's
bitch
We
will
never
be
together
again,
ever
And
when
you're
in
bed
with
him
and
wish
you
was
with
me
Just
remember
that
You
did
this
to
me
(Yeah,
I'm)
Right
back
on
my
bullshit,
right
back
out
on
these
streets
(But
you
did)
Just
remember
that
you
did
this
to
yourself
(Yeah,
you
did
it
to
yourself)
Now,
you
gotta
suffer
the
consequences
(And
sorry
isn't
gonna
help)
Remember
that
you
did
this
to
me
(Michelle)
Right
back
on
my
bullshit,
right
back
out
on
these
streets
(Fuck
around
and
make
you
famous)
Just
remember
that
you
did
this
to
yourself
(Yeah,
you
did
it
to
yourself)
Now,
you
gotta
suffer
the
consequences
(So
when
I'm
hittin'
someone
else
and
you're)
Wastin'
time,
debatin'
'bout
Who
I'm
with
when
I'm
not
around
Just
don't
forget
who
you
fuckin'
with
When
steppin'
on
hallowed
ground
Yeah,
yeah,
sick
(d.a.
got
that
dope)
They
say
these
bars
are
like
COVID
(Bars
are
like
COVID)
You
get
'em
right
off
the
bat
(You
get
'em
right
off
the
bat)
Infected
with
SARS
and
Corona
(Infected
with
SARS
and
Corona)
Like
you
took
a
bite
off
of
that
(Damn)
And
it
goes
from
martian
to
human
(Yeah)
That's
how
the
virus
attacks
(That's
how
the
virus
attacks)
They
come
at
me
with
machine
guns
(Brr)
Like
trying
to
fight
off
a
gnat
Still
stackin'
my
chips,
hoes,
higher
than
Shaq
on
his
tiptoes
Atop
the
Empire
State
Buildin',
this
shit
is
like
child's
play,
children
I
will
not
annihilate,
kill
them,
I'll
fuck
around
and
pile
eight
million
Dead
little
juveniles,
wait,
chill,
then,
I'll
await
my
trial
date
'til
then
Ain't
nothin'
you
say
can
ever
Trump
(Nah),
mic,
pencil
get
killed
(Yeah)
If
you're
hypersensitive,
I
wasn't
referencin'
the
vice
president,
chill
(Chill)
I
mean
my
penmanship
at
times
tends
to
get
ill,
violent
but
with
skill
That's
why
I
hence
when
I
write
ends
up
with
the
mic
and
pencil
gettin'
killed
(Yeah,
hold
up)
And
I'm
still
ride
or
die
for
the
squad
(Yeah)
So
you
know
which
side
that
I'm
on
If
a
battle
line's
ever
drawn,
but
if
I
get
involved
It'll
be
like
K9's
in
a
brawl
But
not
similar
to
Mike
Vick
at
all
'Cause
even
if
I
don't
have
a
dog
in
the
fight
They
ain't
never
gonna
get
rid
of
the
fight
in
the
dog
Got
stripes
like
a
tiger,
so
you
might
get
mauled,
a
mic
in
the
palms
Like
claws,
I
can
swing
right
for
your
jaw
and
rip
it
off
with
one
swipe
of
the
paw
Bitch,
you
still
on
my
dick
or
naw?
(Naw)
If
I
suck,
your
wife
is
a
straw
(Straw)
I'm
sick
and
I'm
not
gonna
cover
my
mouth
next
time
that
I
cough
They
say
these
bars
are
like
COVID
(Bars
are
like
COVID)
You
get
'em
right
off
the
bat
(You
get
'em
right
off
the
bat)
Infected
with
SARS
and
Corona
(Infected
with
SARS
and
Corona)
Like
you
took
a
bite
off
of
that
(Damn)
And
it
goes
from
martian
to
human
(Yeah)
That's
how
the
virus
attacks
(That's
how
the
virus
attacks)
They
come
at
me
with
machine
guns
(Brr)
Like
trying
to
fight
off
a
gnat
(Yeah,
yeah)
And
d.a.
got
that
dope
he
sends
to
me
(Uh-huh)
It's
like
pneumonia
symptoms
and
contracting
COVID
instantly
Which
is
what
separates
my
flow
from
theirs,
so
that
no
one
gets
even
close
to
this
to
pose
a
risk
to
me
So
vocalistically
(What?),
that's
social
distancing
(Yeah)
Flow
going
viral,
you
best
stay
strapped
With
that
Lysol
and
get
way
back
Get
that
Pine-Sol
and
that
Ajax
'Cause
this
dry
cough
is
just
like
football
umpires
callin'
a
playback
Bitch,
back
the
fuck
up
like
fifteen
yards,
these
rhymes
call
for
a
face
mask
(Face
mask)
'Nother
fourteen-day
quarantine,
they're
cordoning
off
everything
This
shit
lookin'
like
a
horror
scene,
like
me
metaphorically
(Damn)
'Cause
them
stay-at-home
orders
seem
like
they
just
keep
getting
more
extreme
Who
knows
when
this
nightmare
will
end?
Like
Monroe,
Norma
Jean
Still
got
that
heroin
lyrical
drip
with
that
morphine
and
that
Thorazine
'Cause
I'm
so
fuckin'
dope
(Dope)
and
you're
a
fiend
And
that's
the
one
thing
that
hasn't
changed
(Nope),
for
some
semblance
of
normalcy
But
I
might
need
that
Hydrochloroquine
'cause
I
got
that
(Yeah)
The
Dark
Horse,
I'm
a
knight-mare
Mom
fed
me
Valium
like
air
Thought
that's
why
they
called
it
a
high
chair
(Woah)
I
got
a
contact
like
eyewear
Woah,
wait
a
minute,
bitch,
let
me
lie
here
20/20
hindsight
in
my
side
mirror
Every
year,
you
drop
the
ball
like
Times
Square
My
hair
trigger
whenever
I
get
an
idea
Fuck,
now
my
name
rings
out
like
a
sponge
mop
And
my
drip
was
a
drop
In
the
bucket,
so
that
gun
shot
You
just
heard
just
now
in
that
one
spot
Just
came
from
the
nine
mil'
that
I
just
got
That's
big
bucks
and
I
got
a
full
money
clip
and
I'm
loaded
I
ain't
even
mean
to
go
the
fuck
off
I'm
still
totally
inappropriate
with
an
opiate
Groping
it
while
I'm
holding
it
like
a
trophy
I'm
hoping
a
little
codeine'll
get
me
OD'in'
Woah,
everything
is
slow,
I
begin
to
floating
I
know
that
I'm
getting
loaded,
the
pen
exploded
Hiroshima
with
the
flows,
a
utopia
With
the
dope,
I'm
an
OG,
I'm
like
the
G.O.A.T
Here
to
get
your
goat
little
bit
of
sodium,
it's
assault
When
I'm
at
the
podium,
at
your
throat,
holy
camoly
I'm
in
the
zone
with
the
shit
I'm
on
Get
Imodium
and
a
commode
because
nobody's
even
close
You're
petroleum
to
plutonium,
you're
a
phony
I'm
at
the
crib
with
your
ho,
got
her
at
the
pole
like
voting
with
no
clothing
Stripped
down
to
a
toe
ring
and
here
we
go
with
the
gloating
I've
got
my
nose
in
the
air
like
a
Boeing
Then
I
got
into
a
little
bit
of
an
argument
with
her
So
I
took
a
little
lick
of
a
Klonopin
at
dinner
Then
I
hit
her
with
the
motherfucking
ottoman
and
bit
her
Then
I
shot
her
in
the
liver,
delivered
her
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
But
I'm
probably
gon'
jump
in
the
water
with
her
With
a
wad
of
money
'cause
I
got
a
lot
of
it
And
when
it
come
to
drippin',
I
be
soppin'
like
a
hundred
mile
an
hour
Never
runnin'
out
of
either
one
of
'em,
I
gotta
get
it
'cause
They
say
these
bars
are
like
COVID
(Bars
are
like
COVID)
You
get
'em
right
off
the
bat
(You
get
'em
right
off
the
bat)
Infected
with
SARS
and
Corona
(Infected
with
SARS
and
Corona)
Like
you
took
a
bite
off
of
that
(Damn)
And
it
goes
from
martian
to
human
(Yeah)
That's
how
the
virus
attacks
(That's
how
the
virus
attacks)
They
come
at
me
with
machine
guns
(Brr)
It's
like
trying
to
fight
off
a
gnat
(Fight
off
a
gnat)
Yeah
You
know
I've
been
around
for
a
while
now
Not
sure
if
I
have
much
left
to
prove
Yeah,
I
do,
haha
I
look
at
me
now
I'm
thinkin,
"Damn"
How
proud
of
me
I
am
What
I
did,
it's
nothin'
to
sneeze
at
Even
if
your
allergies
are
bad
I'm
up
in
a
balcony
in
France
I
look
around,
I
see
the
fans
How
they
surround
me
in
the
stands
Probably
could
drown
in
a
sea
of
hands
They
hollerin',
"Shady"
Yellin'
it
out
to
me
and
that's
what
I
mean
when
I
say
That
one
day
someway,
somehow,
if
I
get
a
chance
to
get
a
crowd
I'll
flip
it
around
and
have
a
crowd
give
me
the
chance
I've
done
it
all,
man
But
in
actuality
I
haven't,
yet
Where
am
I
supposed
to
go
from
here?
Oh
hey,
oh-oh-oh
Really
I
have
no
idea
All
I
know
it's
every
time
I
think
I
hit
my
ceiling
I
go
higher
than
I've
ever
fuckin'
been
Where
am
I
supposed
to
go
from
here?
Oh
hey,
oh-oh-oh
Really
I
have
no
idea
All
I
know
it's
every
time
I
think
I
hit
my
ceiling
I
go
higher
than
I've
ever
fuckin'
been
Got
no
time
for
no
haters
in
this
bitch
Or
toleration
for
this
shit
But
like
medication,
my
dedication
And
the
time
it
takes
to
do
this
shit
Reminds
me
of
how
an
overcrowded
hospital
waitin'
room'll
get
But
I
mean
it's
maybe
I
have
more
patience
than
I'm
able
to
admit
Yeah,
but
I'm
still
mentally
stable
as
a
three-legged
table
in
this
bitch
Fame
was
a
switch
but
I
was
grateful
to
trade
that
shit
for
the
trailer
with
the
hitch
Thought
it
would
made
me
a
ravin'
lunatic
But
I
made
it
through
to
my
situation,
I
hit
pay
dirt
Now
I
get
paper
like
a
stapler
in
this
bitch
But
just
'cause
I
made
a
little
bit
of
change
Don't
mean
I've
changed
a
little
bit
Brain
full
of
wit,
dangerous,
can't
extinguish
this
English
language
when
it's
lit
Now
I'm
just
paradin',
you
would
still
get
Shady
'til
I'm
eighty
To
I
spit
this
crazy,
even
Grady
knows
I'ma
blow
Better
get
the
handkerchief
again,
haha
Where
am
I
supposed
to

Where

Oh

All

Oh,

Can't

Born

I
can
do
it
and
do
it,
when
I'm
tryin'
to
When
my

they
still
go
through
the
roof
This
atmosphere's

a
chosen
few
Who

moves
And

Been
in
survival
mode
Since
a
five
year
old,
it
was
I
alone
Since
my
trike
was
stole,
spiral
notebook
and
microphone
But
lookin'
back
how
bad
it
was
then
If
it
hadn't
been
for
the
pad
and
the
pen
Addict
mom
and
deadbeat
dad
I
wouldn't
have
the
savage
within
Havin'
to
win,
every
single
battle
I'm
in
All
I
ever
wanted
was
to
be
an
MC
Tediously
I
wrote
obediently,
believing
in
me
EPMD
must've
had
teachin'
degrees
Learn
to
defeat
enemies
with
the
ink,
thinkin'
of
these
rhymes
Would
be
as
easy
as
eatin'
graffiti
Would
be
like
remedial
readin'
to
me
(Yeah)
'Til
my
last
breath
leave
my
lungs,
I'ma
beat
my
drums
(Yeah)
For
the
streets
I'm
from

The
East
side
slums
(Yeah)
Gotta

a
foe
out
(Yeah),
like
fee-fi-fum
You

my
finger
(What?),
you
see
my
thumb
(What?)
You
see
my
fist,
fuck
a
peach
pipe
bum
(What?)
For
the
smoke
but
it's
not
the
weed
I
want
(What?)
With
this
beat
I
brung
for
the
beef
I
come
(Woo)
But
you
better
bring
it
if
you
wanna
reply
from
'Cause
for
you
to
be
lyrically
inclined,
it'd
be
a
steep
climb
up
That'll
be
an
uphill
battle
But
I'm
off
kickin'
feet
in
the
recliner
And
I
think
I'm
up
'Bout
to
go
out
on
a
limb
like
a
tree
climber
Time
to
push
my
ceiling
higher
'cause
Where
am
I
supposed
to
go
from
here?
Oh
hey,
oh-oh-oh
Really
I
have
no
idea
All
I

it's
every
time
I
think
I

my
ceiling
I

higher
than
I've
ever
fuckin'
been
(For
the
last
time)
Where

I
supposed

Yet

(Zombie
on
the

I
want
you
to
change,
but
don't
change
(Yeah)
I
want
you
to
grow
up,
but
don't
age
I
want
the
rage,
but
don't
get
too
angry
I
want
the
new,
but
old
Shady
I
want
you
to
say

almost
lose

It

OJ
In
his
Bronco
goin'
off
the
roadway
(Skrr)
And
get
off
my
dick
If
I
said
my
balls
were
yarn,
you
bitches
would
crochet
All
I

a
rope
chain
From
the
day
I
saw
Cool
J

train
Now
I
got
that,

This

recession
We

America

Black

equal
rights
White

Some

(What?)
But

virus
(Nah)
To
the
cops
that

racially
biased
(What?)
We

these
lies
You

to
a
story,
like
Spider-Man
crawin'
up
side
of
a
wall
and
Some

just
as
unabiding
as
lawmen
(Yeah)
Like
Garrett
Rolfe
and
like
Derek
Chauvin
(Yeah)
No

riding
with
Colin
Though
some
people
don't
like
me
at
all
and
(Yeah)
Some
are
like
bees
to
flowers
(Why?)
'Cause
some
people
find
me
appalling
(Haha)
Ooh,
I
say
a

people
are
outraged
(Oh

The
press
slams
me
again
(Yeah),
the
people
aren't
having
it
nowadays
Give
an
album
that
I
put
out
in
like
2000
you
griped
about
praise
But
I
wake
up
everyday
even
more
caked
up
than
the
makeup
on
your
clown
face
And
I
lay
my
foundation
I
told
my
dawgs
we

Shit,

Dick

trying
to
choose
between
Bizzy,
Layzie,
and
Wish
against
Krayzie

Lee

Used

Used
to
rock
wife
beaters,
now
I
let
your
wife
beat
me
(Yeah)
So
you
can
eat
shit,
but
I
might
be
the
shit
So
when
I
say
"Eat
shit,"
I
mean
me
She
loves
me,
she
loves
my
knot
Not
for
who
I
am,
but
what
I
got,
yeah
And,
I
don't
wanna
blow
up
her
spot
But

watchin'
you

Hate

put
you
on
blast
but
you
got
a
bomb

(Yeah)
Been
checkin'
you

ever
since
the
second
you
stepped
in
through
Nani's
dressing
room
Girl,

stunning,
I'd
bet
that
you'd
zap
me
if
I
was
next
to
you
Spark'll
fly,
I
expect
them
too
I'd
be
shocked
if
they
didn't,
'cause
you're
Carmen
Electrocute
(Cutie)
And
those
ain't
just
sound
effects,
I
knew
something
was
special
as
soon
as
we
swapped
info
I
knew
that
She
loves
me,
she
loves
me
not
For
who
I
am,
but
what
I
got
But
she
loves
me,
she
loves
me
not
(Aha)
She
loves
me
(One
more
time)
I
said
'cause
she
loves
me

not
For

Sorry
I

in
the
studio
usually
But
tomorrow
afternoon
for
me,
it
works
beautifully
If
your
schedule's
open,
you
say,
"That's
cool
with
me,
but
you
stood
me
up
twice,
Slim,
you're
0-for-2
with
me"
'Cause
like
a
basket,
you've
been
going
through
hoops
for
me
Well,
if
the
ball's
in
my
court,
why
don't
we
shoot
for
three?
Yeah,
I'll
pick
you
up
and
we'll
cruise
through
the
D
And
soon
as
we
hung
up,
I'm
like,
"Whoo"
'Cause
she
loves
me
(She
loves
me),
she
loves
me
not
For
who
I
am
(She
loves
me),
but
what
I
got
But
she
loves
me,
she
loves
me
not
(Aha)
She
loves
me
(Ayy

lemme
do
this
bridge
right
quick)
She
pulls
me
close
and
whispers
to
me,
ooh
Lies
in
my
ear,
but
that's
all
I
wanna
hear
It's
okay
long
as
we
both
know
this
is
all
it
is,
woah
She
can
have
my
love
for
as
long
as
we
both
are
here
Back

my
spot

there's
options
to
explore
We
can
fuck
in
the
closet
or
on
my
elevator
(Uh)
And
maybe
when
it
stops
and
the
door
opens,
we
fall
out
and
we
just
get
off
on
this
floor
(Haha)
You
say
you're
falling
for
me

'cause
I'm

Then

You

like,
"I'll

But
for
all
you

I
probably
act
like
I'm
Daniel
Wozniak
I'm
a
psycho-chopathic
killer
I'm
a
capular
caterpillar
With
the
botanic
of
bananas
you
ain't
never
heard

comin
after
your
scapular
For
the

of
a
better
word
Dracula
'Cause
I'm
attackin'

I'm

I

Y'all

Fuckin'

Paroles

par
Eminem
[Eminem]
She
says
I
am
trash,
but
she
listens
to
Tekashi
(Damn)
Bitch,
you
lost
me
(Yeah)
Fair
weather,
wishy-washy
She
thinks
Machine
washed
me
(What?)
Swear
to
God,
man,
her
favorite
rapper
wish
he'd
crossed
me
(Yeah)
I
love
conflict,
got
a
obnoxious
(What?)
subconscious
(Yeah)
I'm
afraid
to
unlock
it
(Nah)
Keep
those
monsters
in
the
closet
I'm
what
an
idiotic
('Otic)
savant
is
(Savant
is)
But
I've
been
throwin'
down
gauntlets
since
that
underground
ruckus
(Yeah)
Where
I
planted
my
roots
(What?
Yeah)
That's
how
I
had
a
whole
planet
that
roots
for
me
As
in
the
group,
and
no
one
thinks
dark
as
I
think
(Nah)
So
imagine
the
havoc
these
black
thoughts
are
to
wreak
As
in
Trotter,
I
keep
slaughterin'
beats
Shout
out
to
Beatminerz
and
T-Minus
But,
me,
long
as
I
re-promise
to
be
honest
And
wholeheartedly,
apologies,
Rihanna
For
that
song
that
leaked,
I'm
sorry,
Ri
It
wasn't
meant
to
cause
you
grief
Regardless,
it
was
wrong
of
me,
but
[Refrain:

I

like
Zeus
When

"You
ain't

I
come

But
I

So

Used

(Through)
And,
Drake,
they're
gonna
turn
on
you
(You)
one
day
too
(Too)
And
the
more
you
win,
the
sooner
(Sooner)
they
do
They'll
be
calling
you
a
trash
bin
Sayin'
that
your
new
one
isn't
better
than
your
last
and
Even
if
it
is,
once
they
start
to
turn
their
backs
They
ain't
never
comin'
back
in
They
did
it
to
Chance
Next
they'll
be
mentionin'
Future
in
the

(Yeah)
Or
sayin'
"Adiós"
to
Migos
I
ain't
dissin',
I'm
just
tryna
keep
this

a
C-note
(Yeah)
Same
people
been
tryna
do
this
shit
to
me,
so
I
call
them
peephole
Because
they're
so
easy
to
see
through
'em
(See

But
a
fighter's
all
I
knew
how
to
be
I
got
the
shit
beat
out
of
me
(Yeah)
Tripped
and
fell
and
blew
out
a
knee
(Pop)
Popped
it
back
in
and
hopped
up
like,
"Fuck
it
(Fuck
it)
Best
two
out
of
three",
yeah
Man,
I
gotta
be
doin'
(What?)
somethin'
right
I
got
eleven
years
of
sobriety
(Yeah)
So
the
only
bottom
I'ma
be
hittin'
is
if
it's
sodomy
Wait,
I
mean,
you
would
think
that
somebody
handed
a
saw
to
me
How
I'm
choppin'
these
bars
They
keep
wantin'
me
to
rap
responsibly
When
I'm
constantly
passin'
the
buck
like
the
fuckin'
Dollar
Tree
But
I'ma
always
remind
you
that
I
came
from
poverty
Black
people
saved
my
life,
from
the
Doc
and
Deshaun
And
all
that
we
want
is
racial
equality
R.I.P.
Laquan
McDonald,
Trayvon,
and
Breonna
Atatiana,
Rayshard,
and
Dominique
Eric

No,
we

along
'til
these
white

cops
Who
keep
murderin'
Blacks
are
off
the
streets
(Off

And,
as
far
as
squashin'
beef,
I'm
used
to
people
knockin'
me
But,
just
not
in
my
camp
I'm
diplomatic
'cause
I'm
tryna
be
Last
thing
I
need
is
Snoop
doggin'
me
Man,
dog,
you
was
like
a
(Yeah)
damn
god
to
me
Nah,
not
really
(Haha)
I
had
"dog"
backwards
But
I'm
startin'

all
these
people
takin'
shots
at

Shit,
it's
no

[Refrain:

When

I

Oh,

I'm
discombobulated
Let's
take
'em
back
(Accents)
In

(Everything's
all
fucked
up)
I'm
discombobulated,
discombobulated
Miss,
you
ovulating?
Wait,
I
didn't
mean
to
Piss
you
off,
my
lady,
what
I
really
meant
to
say
is
It
goes
a
little
something
like
this
Soon
as
I'm
through
with
the
Unisom
I'ma
hit
the
snooze
alarm
Before
I
lose
my
mind,
who
am
I
gonna
use
it
on?
Utilizing
this
tool,
I
will
execute
a
line
Like
what
I
tried
to
do
one
time
in
my
youth
when
I
euthanized
My
poodle
in
junior
high,
used
to
hide
in
my
room
and
fly
To
the
moon
and
try
suicide
with
the
glue
from
my
school
supplies
Then
Proof,
Denaun
Eye-Kyu
and
I
would
climb
in
that
hooptie
to
ride
to
Drew's
and
rhyme
Bodied
Saint
Andrew's
Hall
too
many
times
to
count
Before
I
tear
up
The
Shelter,
give
my
dawgs
a
pound
Now
I'm
'bout
to
treat
all
of
you
rappers
noggins
how
Dre
does
every
time
he
goes
back
to
Compton
now
'Cause
every
so
often
I'll
visit
my
old
stomping
grounds
And
Doc's
in
the
house,
so
you
know
the
bong
is
out
Room
is
spinning
like
nine-hundred-thousand
miles
an
hour
Forgot
what
I'm
talkin'
'bout,
fuck,
I'm
discombobulated
Now
up
is
down,
left
is
right
Day
is
night
now,
in
is
out,
black
is
white
So
to-and-fro
and
side-to-side
Am
I
coming
or
going?
Man,
I
can't
decide
'Cause
back
is
forth
now
and
stop
means
go
No
means
yes,
but
yes
don't
mean
no
So
baby,
please,
take
off
your
clothes
(No!)
Yes!
(No!)
Yes!
(No!)
No!
(Yes!)
Oh!
(Oh!),
yeah
Just
flew
the
coop,
the
cops
are
in
hot
pursuit
But
the
day
they
catch
me
is
the
day
50'll
call
a
truce
And
quash
the
feud
with
him
and
Ja
and
Ja'll
actually
spit
a
bar
That's
not
from
a
Dr.
Seuss
book
and
they'll
start
a
group
(Haha)
Fuck
it,
I'm
a
kook,
I
know
I
got
a
screw
And
a
couple
of
marbles
loose,
brain
is
like
ramen
soup
Shout
to
Trugoy,
gotta
give
a
De

'Cause
my

knot,
call
it
pasta
noose
(Yeah)

Same
Marshall
Bruce
in
that
battle
who
lost
to
Juice
Who
also
used
to
sound
like
Nas
on
"Live
at
the
Barbeque"
Now
I
got
the
juice,
wouldn't
beef
if
I
was
you
Like,
au
jus,
but
beef,
if
like
"I
was
you,"
but,
like,
ah,
fuck
you
(Man)
Long
as
I
got
these
walls
and
these
hallways
I'm
always
Have
someone
to
argue
with,
I'm
just
all
twisted,
I'm
discombobulated
Now
up
is
down,
left
is

Day
is
night
now,
in
is

black
is

So
to-and-fro

Man,
I
can't

'Cause

No

So
baby,

take
off
your

(No!)
Yes!
(No!)
Yes!
(No!)
No!
(Yes!)
Oh!
(Oh!)
I'm
at
my
best
when
I'm
at
my
worst
And
for
that
I'm
blessed,
so
every
time
I
rap
I
curse
And
that's
why
press,
I
usually
get
attacked
by
first
They're
at
my
neck
like
motherfucking
vampires
So
critics
si-day
I
si-day
the
same
shi-dit,
I'm
always
degrading,
little
bi-ditch
Well,
fi-duck
'em,
they
can
si-duck
my
di-dick
when
I'm
taking
shi-dit
Mid-y
middle
fid-inger
is
ex-tid-ended
now,
should
I
tell
'em
where
to
put
it?
I'm
si-do
fed
up
with
it,
they
ask
me
dumb
shi-dit
So
I
act
like
I'm
on
a
kayak
with
my
back
to
Niagara
No
life
jacket,
man,
I
had
like
six
psychiatrists,
scientists
Misdiagnose
me
with
plaque
psoriasis
'cause
I
asked
'em,
"Why
is
it
My
eye
itches?"
so
they
gave
me
some
diet
tips
And
Viagra
with
side
effects,
I
might
end
up
growing
spiderwebs
In
my
head
and
dying
a
horrifying
death,
on
my
final
breath
I
will
tell
you,
apply
your
lips
to
my
dick,
it's
one
size
that
fits
I
just
took
an
AIDS
test
and
the
doctor
said
to
think
positive,
what
the
fuck?
Now
up
is
down,
left
is
right
Day
is
night
now,
in
is
out,
black
is

So
to-and-fro
and

Am

Man,
I
can't
decide
'Cause
back

and

No
means

don't

We're
out
I'm
the
illest
rapper
to
hold
a
cordless
Patrolling
corners
Looking
for
hookers
to
punch
in
the
mouth
with
a
roll
of
quarters
I'm
meaner
in
action
Than
Rosco
beating
James
Tarteenyer
(?)
And
smackin
his
back
with
vacuum
cleaner
attachments
I
grew
up
in
the
wild
hood
As
a
hazardous
youth
With
a
fucked
up
childhood
That
I
used
as
an
excuse
And
aint
shit
changed
But
kept
the
same
mindstate
Since
the
third
time
that
I
failed
9th
grade
You
probably
think
that
I'm
a
negative
person
don't
be
so
sure
of
it
I
don't
promote
violence
I
just
encourage
it
I
laugh
at
the
sight
of
death
As
I
fall
down
a
cement
flight
of
steps
And
land
inside
a
bed
of
spider
webs
So
throw
caution
to
the
wind
You
and
a
friend
Can
jump
off
of
a
bridge
and
if
you
live,
do
it
again
Shit,
why
not?
Blow
your
brain
out
I'm
blowing
mine
out
Fuck
it,
you
only
live
once
you
might
as
well
die
now
It's
only
fair
to
warn
I
was
born
with
a
set
of
horns
And
metaphors
attached

my
damn
umbulical
cord
Warlord

Doctor

Driving

Snatched

a
promise
as
Nostradamus
Cause
I
aint
making
no
more
threats
I'm
doing
drivebys
in
tinted
Corvettes
on
Vietnam
war
vets
I'm
more
or
less
sick
in
the
head
Maybe
more
cause
I
smoked
crack
(?)
today,
yesterday,
and
the
day
before
sabbath
Walk
the
block
with
a
labrador
Strapit
more
corral
for
war
than
El
Salvador
Foul
style
galore
Verbal
cow
manure
Coming
together
like
the
eyebrow
on
Al
B.
Sure
[Verse
1:]
you
probably
gonna
think
that
i'm
talking
about
you
and
you
goddamn
right
i
am
look
at
you,
this
is
the
minimal
i
could
diss
you
subliminally,
but
i
think
criminal
instinct
has
pushed
me
to
the
brink,
my
pussy
does
it
stink
he
still
loves
me
cause
he
puts
me
in
his
ink
he
does,
doesn't
he,
still
is,
isn't
he?
nah,
i'm
just
playing
tug
of
war
with
his
heart
cause
he
misses
me
i
can
still
fuck
him
and
leave
him
whenever
i
feel
frisky
and
is
no
risk
of
disease
cause
he
ain't
with
anyone
is
he?
this
bitch
really
thinks
she
can
get
me
if
she
still
wants
me,
driving
across
country
strapped
him
to
the
front
seat,
missing
all
the
front
teeth
thinking
to
herself
when's
the
next
time
he's
gonna
punch
me?
i
told
this
cunt
she's
gonna
over-do
it
once
and
once
she
does,
she
was
stuffed
up
in
a
trunk
crunch,
he
scrunched
her
up
in
a
ball
bunched
up
nice
and
comfy
fuck
around
get
dumped
up
in
a
lake
'fore
you
dump
me
you
cunning
little
cunt,
deceitful
witch
you
thought
you
had
me,
'till
my
shrink
told
me
this
[Hook:]
the
problem
is
all
inside
your
head
she
said
to
me
the
answer
is
easy
if
you
take
it
logically
i'd
like
to
help
you
in
your
struggle
to
be
free
there
must
be
50
ways

leave
your
lover
[Verse
2:]
i
feel
like
a
serial
killer
i
keep
dumping
bodies
in
the
lake,
i'ma
get
caught
and
send
up
the
river
i
shiver
when
i
think
of
the
company
i
keep
how
do
i
know
she
ain't
gonna
kill
me
when
i
sleep
i
shriek,
every
time
she
hands
me
something
to
drink
sex
kept
us
together,
when
we
slept
together
every-thing
was
all
better,
she
made
me
feel
like
a
king
slowly,
she
began
lowering
my
self-esteem
she
go
to
the
club
and
not
answer
the
phone
when
i
call
her
and
i
just
bought
her
a
truck
for
50,000
dollars
accused
me
of
doing
drugs
and
screaming
?holla?
then
i
find
a
bag
of
coke
on
her,
some
marijuana
and
all
i
know
is
every
time
i
go
to
them
hiding
spots,
wherever
she
hides
her
blow
the
little
bags
of
dope,
there
was
a
pile
of
coke
that's
growing
smaller,
and
that
was
just
a
while
ago
and
i
wouldn't
even
let
on
like
i
know
what
was
i
supposed
to
do,
call
her
out
on
it,
we
just
argue
say
she
put
it
down
on
purpose
and
flipped
the
whole
script
ooh
she's
a
manipulative
evil
bitch
a
cunning
little
cunt,
little
deceitful
witch
she
thought
she
had
me,
'till
my
shrink
told
me

Paroles
de
la
chanson
8
Mile
par
Eminem
It's
alright,
it's
okay
I'm
gonna
make
it
anyway
Gonna
make
it,
can't
give
up
now
I'ma
make
it
somehow
Sometimes
I
just
feel
like
quitting,
I
still
might
Why
do
I
put
up
this
fight,
why
do
I
still
write?
Sometimes
it's
hard
enough
just
dealin'
with
real
life
Sometimes
I
wanna
jump
on
stage
and
just
kill
mics
And
show
these
people
what
my
level
of
skill's
like
But
I'm
still
white,
sometimes
I
just
hate
life
Something
ain't
right,
hit
the
brake
lights
Case
of
the
stage
fright,
drawin'
a
blank
like...
Da-duh-duh-da-da,
it
ain't
my
fault
Great
big
eyeballs,
my
insides
crawl
And
I
clam
up,
I
just
slam
shut
I
just
can't
do
it,
my
whole
manhood's
Just
been
stripped,
I
have
just
been
‘vict'd
So
I
must
then
get
off
the
bus,
then
split
Man
fuck
this
shit
yo,
I'm
going
the
fuck
home
World
on
my
shoulders
as
I
run
back
to
this
8
mile
road
I'm
a
man,
I'ma
make
a
new
plan
(It's
alright,
it's
okay)
Time
for
me
to
just
stand
up
and
travel
new
land
(I'm
gonna
make
it
anyway)
Time
for
me
to
just
take
matters
into
my
own
hands
(Gonna
make
it,
can't
give
up
now)
Once
I'm
over
these
tracks
man
I'ma
never
look
back
(I'ma
make
it
somehow)
(8
mile
road)
And
I'm
gone,
I
know
right
where
I'm
going
(It's
alright,
it's
okay)
Sorry
mama
I'm
grown,
I
must
travel
alone
(I'm
gonna
make
it
anyway)
Ain't
gon'
follow
no
footsteps,
I'm
making
my
own
(Gonna
make
it,
can't
give
up
now)
Only
way
that
I
know
how
to
escape
from
this
8
mile
road
(I'ma
make
it
somehow)
I'm
walking
these
train
tracks,
tryna
regain
back
The
spirit
I
had
‘fore
I
go
back
to
the
same
crap
To
the
same
plant,
in
the
same
pants
Tryna
chase
rap,
gotta
move
ASAP
And
get
a
new
plan,
momma's
got
a
new
man
Poor
little
baby
sister,
she
don't
understand
Sits
in
front
of
the
TV,
buries
her
nose
in
the
pad
And
just
colors
until
the
crayon
gets
dull
in
her
hand
While
she
colors
her
big
brother,
her
mother
and
dad
Ain't
no
tellin'
what
really
goes
on
in
her
little
head
Wish
I
could
be
the
daddy
that
neither
one
of
us
had
But
I
keep
runnin'
from
something
I
never
wanted
so
bad!
Sometimes
I
get
upset,
cause
I
ain't
blew
up
yet
It's
like
I
grew
up,
but
I
ain't
grow
me
two
nuts
yet
Don't
gotta
rep
my
step,
don't
got
enough
pep
The
pressure's
too
much
man,
I'm
just
tryna
do
what's
best
And
I
try,
sit
alone
and
I
cry
Yo
I
won't
tell
no
lie,
not
a
moment
goes
by
That
I
don't
pray
to
the
sky,
please
I'm
beggin'
you
God
Please
don't
let
me
be
pigeonholed
in
no
regular
job
Yo
I
hope
you
can
hear
me
homie
wherever
you
are
Yo
I'm
tellin'
you
dawg
I'm
bailin'
this
trailer
tomorrow
Tell
my
mother
I
love
her,
kiss
baby
sister
goodbye
Say
whenever
you
need
me
baby
I'm
never
too
far
But
yo
I
gotta
get
out
there
the
only
way
I
know
And
I'ma
be
back
for
you
the
second
that
I
blow
On
everything
I
own,
I'll
make
it
on
my
own
Off
to
work
I
go
back
to
this
8
mile
road
I'm
a
man,
I'ma
make
a
new
plan
(It's
alright,
it's
okay)
Time
for
me
to
just
stand
up
and
travel
new
land
(I'm
gonna
make
it

Time
for
me
to
just
take
matters
into
my
own
hands
(Gonna
make
it,
can't
give
up
now)
Once
I'm
over
these
tracks
man
I'ma
never
look

(I'ma

(8

And
I'm

I
know
right
where
I'm

(It's

Sorry
mama
I'm

I
must
travel

(I'm

Ain't

Only

that
I

how
to
escape
from
this
8

road
(I'ma

You
gotta
live
it
to
feel
it,
you
didn't
you
wouldn't
get
it
Or
see
what
the
big
deal
is,
why
it
was
and
it
still
is
To
be
walkin'
this
borderline
of
Detroit
city
limits
It's
different,
it's
a
certain
significance,
a
certificate
Of
authenticity,
you'd
never
even
see
But
it's
everything
to
me,
it's
my
credibility
You
never
seen,
heard,
smelled,
or
met
a
real
MC
Who's
incredible
upon
the
same
pedestal
as
me
But
yet
I'm
still
unsigned,
havin'
a
rough
time
Sit
on
the
porch
with
all
my
friends
and
kick
dumb
rhymes
Go
to
work
and
serve
MC's
in
the
lunchline
But
when
it
comes
crunch
time,
where
do
my
punchlines
go
Who
must
I
show
to
bust
my
flow?
Where
must
I
go,
who
must
I
know?
Or
am
I
just
another
crab
in
the
bucket
Cause
I
ain't
havin
no
luck
with
this
little
Rabbit's
foot,
fuck
it
Maybe
I
need
a
new
outlet,
I'm
startin'
to
doubt
shit
I'm
feelin
a
little
skeptical
who
I
hang
out
with
I
look
like
a
bum,
yo
my
clothes
ain't
about
shit
At
the
salvation
army
tryna
salvage
an
outfit
And
it's
cold
tryna
travel
this
road
Plus
I
feel
like
I'm
always
stuck
in
this
battlin'
mode
My
defenses
are
so
up,
but
one
thing
I
don't
want
Is
pity
from
no
one,
this
city
is
no
fun
There
is
no
sun,
and
it's
so
dark
Sometimes
I
just
feel
like
I'm
just
bein'
pulled
apart
From
each
one
of
my
limbs,
by
each
one
of
my
friends
It's
enough
to
just
make
me
wanna
jump
out
of
my
skin
Sometimes
I
feel
like
a
robot,
sometimes
I
just
know
not
What
I'm
doin
I
just
blow,
my
head
is
a
stove
top
I
just
explode,
the
kettle
gets
so
hot
Sometimes
my
mouth
just
overloads
the
gas
that
I
don't
got
But
I've
learned,
it's
time
for
me
to
U-turn
Yo
it
only
takes
one
time
for
me
to
get
burned
Ain't
no
falling,
no,
next
time
I
meet
a
new
girl
I
can
no
longer
play
stupid
or
be
immature
I
got
every
ingredient,
all
I
need
is
the
courage
Like
I
already
got
the
beat,
all
I
need
is
the
words
Got
the
urge,
suddenly
it's
a
surge
Suddenly
a
new
burst
of
energy
has
occurred
Time
to
show
these
free
world
leaders
at
three
in
the
third
I
am
no
longer
scared
now,
I'm
free
as
a
bird
Then
I
turn
and
cross
over
the
median
curb
Hit
the
‘burbs
and
all
you
see
is
a
blur
from
8
mile
road
I'm
a
man,
I'ma
make
a
new
plan
(It's
alright,
it's
okay)
Time
for
me
to
just
stand
up
and
travel
new
land
(I'm
gonna
make
it
anyway)
Time
for
me
to
just
take
matters
into
my
own
hands
(Gonna
make
it,
can't
give
up
now)
Once
I'm
over
these
tracks
man
I'ma
never
look
back
(I'ma
make
it
somehow)
(8
mile
road)
And
I'm
gone,
I
know
right
where
I'm
going
(It's
alright,
it's
okay)
Sorry
mama
I'm
grown,
I
must
travel
alone
(I'm
gonna
make
it
anyway)
Ain't
gon'
follow
no
footsteps,
I'm
making
my
own
(Gonna
make
it,
can't
give
up
now)
Only
way
that
I
know
how
to
escape
from
this
8
mile
road
(I'ma
make
it
somehow)

WAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!
{*laughs*}
Guess
who's
back?!?!
Mommy!
We're
home!!
Say
hello
to
my
new
friends
DJ
Muggs,
Soul
Assassins,
Cypress

Everybody!
Put
your
hands
where
my
eyes
can

[Verse

Eminem]
Everywhere
we
go
people
know
that
we
roll
deep
as
fuck
Fourty
fifty
Samoans,
they
knowing
when
D-Bo
was
50,
Tweezy,
Obie
there
won't
be
no
hoe
in
us
They
pop
shit
like
they
gon
do
shit
but
no
one
does
From
New
York
down
to
Texas,
back
up
to
Los
Angeles
We've
changed
the
way
we
move
so
man
up
if
you
can't
adjust
You
may
end
up
getting
rushed
by
too
many
to
handle
us
It's
funny,
I
guess
money
does
have
its
advantages
And
it
isn't
that
we
just
think
that
we
can't
be
touched
It's
not
like
we're
just
feeling
ourselves
that
much
It's
just,
that
if
someone
ever
does
put
us
in
the
clutch
We
just
know
that
y'all
ain't
gon
be
the
one
who's
gon
do
it
Cause
first
of
all
you're
pussy
and
everybody
can
see
that
You
fuck
around,
get
caught
in
a
spot
that
you
shouldn't
be
at
That
you
got
no
business
being
in,
we
ain't
even
gon
be
in
it
No
one's
gunna
hear
nothing,
no
one's
gunna
see
this
shit
And
they'll
be
in
and
up
out
of
it,
them
boys
is
bout
it,
bout
it
The
noise
from
(?)
be
drowned
out
by
the
crowd
And
you'll
be
laying
on
the
ground
getting
trampled
by
people
dancing
Till
the
club
closes,
and
clears
out
And
that's
when
they
see
you
flatened
Nobody
saw
it
happen,
all
cause
your
jaws
are
flapping
And
you
couldn't
stop
yapping
and
took
it
past
rapping
It
ain't
about
the
music
no
more,
it's
bout
trying
to
show
off
And
it
feels
like
any
minute
the
bomb
is
bout
to
go
off
[Chorus
-
Eminem]
Shit's
about
to
change,
cause
we
ain't
playing
no
games
We
ain't
budging
neither
are
they,
we
ain't
saying
no
names
Shit
just
ain't
the
same,
when
the
Aks
gettin
sprayed
cause
Hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
911
It
ain't
about
hip-hop,
cause
those
days
are
gone
It
ain't
about
trying
rip
shots,
to
get
props
no
more
It's
about
trying
not
to
get
popped,
and
get
dropped
to
the
floor
Cause
hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
911
[Verse

B-Real]
Step
off
my
holster
cause
shit
it's
getting
serious
All
theses
drugs
you
be
fucking
with
make
you
delirious
Thinking
you
coming
with
heat,
yo
son,
I'm
curious
How
long
are
you
gunna
hate
us
and
judge
us
and
jury
us?
Some
people
can
never
fade
us,
that
make
us
so
furious
Mistake
us
for
fakers,
homie
we
greater
and
glorious
We
living
for
real
and
others
just
making
the
stories
up
Allusions
are
broken,
so
live
it
up,
you
corny
fucks
If
you
take
a
fucking
minute
to
think
about
what
you've
done
When
you
stood
against
a
gangsta
who
live
and
die
by
the
gun
Got
a
hot
one,
spraying
you
bitches
til
there
is
none
I'm
like
a
rolling
stone
homie,
I
got
you
under
my
thumb
Silly
little
bitches
can
end
up
right
up
in
ditches
We
cut
you
and
give
you
stitches,
for
envy
and
all
my
riches
Your
game's
just
like
a
midget,
you're
clocking
a
small
digit
Dealing
with
the
Giant
Goliath,
people
that's
how
we
live
it,
c'mon
[Chorus]
about
to
change,
cause
we
ain't

We
ain't

no
more
It's
about
trying
not
to
get
popped,
and
get
dropped
to
the
floor
Cause
hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
911
[Verse
-
Ganxsta
Ridd]
Uh,
gangsta
Ganxsta
who
come
to
pay
you
a
visit
On
this
shit
you
call
hip-hop,
this
function
is
where
did
it
When
I
-
put
it
in
motion,
my
focus
is
getting
branded
My
appetite
for
destruction
is
blasted
because
I
said
it
Got
you
-
stumbling
for
cover,
this
music
dying
in
numbers
But
you
wouldn't
pause
and
wonder,
admitting
it's
all
glamour
When
you
-
enter
the
business
you
thinking
you
running
shit
You
witness
that
funny
shit,
your
bitches
they
ain't
shit!
We
gangstas
we
blast
first,
ask
questions
later
All
these
-
imitators
parading
like
they
some
playas
Trying
to
-
save
hip-hop
the
task
is
something
greater
Cause
we
old
fashioned
coded
with
loyalty
motivaters
Get
caught,
I'm
not
telling,
or
more
like
killing
not
caring
I'm
riding
a
-
gangsta
feeling,
no
fearing
when
gangstas
dying
I'm
in
a
-
full
circle
with
homies
that's
supposed
to
bleed
On
an
8
Mile
mission
with
Cypress
and
O.G.'s
[Chorus]
about
to
change,
cause
we
ain't
playing
no
games
We
ain't
budging
neither
are
they,
we
ain't
saying
no
names
Shit
just
ain't
the
same,
when
the
Aks
gettin
sprayed
cause
Hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
911
It
ain't
about
hip-hop,
cause
those
days
are
gone
It
ain't
about
trying
rip
shots,
to
get
props
no
more
It's
about
trying
not
to
get
popped,
and
get
dropped
to
the
floor
Cause
hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
911

A
drop
in
the
ocean
a
change
in
the
weather,
I
was
praying
that
you
and
me
might
end
up
together.
It's
like
wishing
for
rain
as
I
stand
in
the
desert,
But
I'm
holding
you
closer
than
most'cause
you
are
my
heaven.
[Kanye
West]
How
you
listen
to
a
girl
that
still
wanna
man
Tell
me
the
truth
is
that
a
man
or
Juwanna
Mann
I'm
wonderin'
why
she
"ret
to
go"
like
Wanda
then
When
we
met
you
was
a
V
like
Madonna,
man
Now
you
in
the
field
runnin'
plays
like
Donovan
McNabb
before
you
get
in
a
cab
I'll
trade
in
my
cab
Just
to
take
you
back
to
last
summer,
man
You
don't
remember
when
you
was
my
sweetest
You
don't
remember
when
I
called
you
Reese's
Pieces
Cause
it's
no
wrong
way
to
do
you
know
what
She
turned
around
and
giggle
said;
"You
so
nuts!"
But
nowadays
we
actin'
way
too
grown
up
Like
how
ya
ex
girl
get
the
new
numba
The
rumors
was
so
numerous
For
stickin'
by
me,
I
had
to
give
you
two
thumbs
up
And
that's
why
A
drop
in
the
ocean
a
change
in
the
weather,
I
was
praying
that
you
and
me
might
end
up
together.

[Eminem]
So
young,
so
full
of
life
and
vibrant,
Side
by
side
wherever
you
was
ridin',
I
went,
So
close
almost
was
some
Bonnie
and
Clyde
shit,
When
Ronnie
died
you
was
right
by
my
side,
With
a
shoulder
to
cry
on
and
a
tissue
to
wipe
my
eyes,
And
a
bucket
to
catch
every
tear
I
cried
inside
it,
You
even
had
the
same
type
of
childhood
I
did,
Sometimes
I
just
wanna
know
why,
Is
it
that
you
surcame
to
yours,
And
mine
I
survived
it,
You
ran
the
streets
I
nine
to
fived
it,
We
grew
up,
grew
apart
as
time
went
by
us,
Then
I
blew
up
to
both
yours
and
mine
surprises,
Now
I
feel
the
vibe
I
just
cant
describe
it,
Much
as
your
pride
tries
to
hide
it,
You're
cold
your
touch,
its
like
ice,
And
your
eyes
is
the
look
of
resentment,
I
can
sense
it
and
I
don't
like
it
A
drop
in
the
ocean
a
change
in
the
weather,
I
was
praying
that
you
and
me
might
end
up

Uh,

in
this

Say
I'm
living
too
fast,
don't

on
changing
my

Got
one
foot

Smoke

It's
lonely
at
the

I'm
tired
of
having
company
Uh,
so
while
you
busy
trying
to
fit
in,
I'm
a
stand
out
And
view
my
life
through
this
lens
to
see
how
it
pan's
out
Substitute

Middle

Speculating

I'm
speaking
as

You's

A

Hi!
Original
Bad
Boy
on
the
case,
cover
your
face
Came
in
the
place
blowed,
and
sprayed
Puffy
with
Mase
I
laced
the
weed
with
insect
repellant,
better
check
the
smelly
Eminem
starts
with
E,
better
check
the
spelling
with
a
capital,
somebody
grab
me
a
Snapple
I
got
an
aspirin
capsule
trapped
in
my
adam's
apple
(hurry
up!)
Somebody
dropped
me
on
my
head,
and
I
was
sure
that
my
mother
did
it,
but
the
bitch
won't
admit
it
was
her
I
slit
her
stomach
open
with
a
scalpel
when
she
was
six
months
and
said,
"I'm
ready
now
bitch
-
ain't
you
feelin
these
kicks
cunt?"
The
world
ain't
ready
for
me
yet,
I
can
tell
I'll
probably
have
a
cell
next
to
the
furnace
in
hell
I'm
sicker
than
sperm
cells
with
syphillis
germs
and
I'm
hotter
than
my
dick
is,
when
I
piss
and
it
burns
I
kick
you
in
the
tummy
until
you
sick
to
your
stomach
and
vomit
so
much
blood
that
your
clothes
stick
to
you
from
it
(yuck!)
(Yuck!)
Hit
you
in
the
head
with
a
brick
til
you
plummet
If
y'all
don't
like
me,
you
can
suck
my
dick
til
you
numb
it
And
all
that
gibberish
you
was
spittin,
you
need
to
kill
it
Cause
your
style
is
like
dyin
in
my
sleep,
I
don't
feel
it

I'm

I'm
Slim,

is
really
a

to

with
in

I
get
chased
by

aliens
A
brainiac,
with
a
cranium
packed,
full
of
more

than
a

Saudi
Arabian
A
highly
combustible
head,
spazmatic
strapped
to
a
Kraftmatic
adjustable
bed
Laid
up
in
the
hospital
in
critical
condition
I
flatlined;
jumped
up
and
ran
from

mortician
High

full
of
thai
weed
Lookin
Chinese,
with
my

stuck

Uhh,

I

God

Last
night
I
O.D.'d
on
rush,
mushrooms
and
dust
and
got
rushed
to
the
hospital
to
get
my
system
flushed
(Shucks!)
I'm
an
alcoholic
and
that's
all
I
can
say
I
call
in
to
work,
cause
all
I
do
is
frolic
and
play
I
swallow
grenades,
and
take
about
a
bottle
a
day
of
Tylenol
3,
and
talk
about
how
violent
I'll
be
(RRARRRRH)
Give
me
eleven
Excederin
my
head'll
spin
Medicine'll
get
me
revvin
like
a
747
jet
engine
Scratched
my
balls
til
I
shredded
skin
"Doctor,
check
this
rash,
look
how
red
it's
been"
"It's
probably
AIDS!"
Forget
it
then
I
strike
a
still
pose
and
hit
you
with
some
ill
flows
that
don't
even
make
sense,
like
dykes
usin
dildos
So
reach
in
your
billfolds,
for
ten
ducats
and
pick
up
this
Slim
Shady
shit
that's
on
Rawkus
Somethin
somethin
somethin,
somethin
I
get
weeded
My
daughter
scribbled
over
that
rhyme,
I
couldn't
read
it
Damn!
[Intro]
The
Wild
Gotham
The
Wild
West
Ah
ha,
ride
[Dre]
All
you
see
is
the
sun
reflectin'
off
of
the
gun
Ready
for
the
showdown
to
go
down
at
1
Sweat
on
my
brow,
let's
settle
it
now
I'mma
show
you
how
real
cowboys
get
down
I'm
polishin'
gold,
waiting
for
this
drama
to
unfold
I
got
a
blunt
rolled
Feelin'
bold,
gangsta's
blood
run
cold
It's
time
to
reload
this
old
45
Colt
And
the
wind
gust,
it's
hot
and
muggy,
dusty
Bust
a
couple
shots,
make
sure
I'm
not
rusty
It's
passed
noon,
he
should
be
here
soon
I
sip
a
little
moonshine
inside
a
saloon
All
of
a
sudden
I
could
hear
the
sound
of
hoofs
Sounds
like
a
thousand
wolves
I
cock
back,
put
the
toast
in
the
holster
and
frooze
I
pose
like
a
poster,
he's
closer
than
close
I
hold
the
heat
sturdy,
I
heard
he
fight's
dirty
But
I'mma
put
thirty
inside
him
and
leave
early
And
just
when
I
went
to
fill
him
with
hot
lead
I
put
the
gun
to
his
head
and
this
is
what
he
said
[Eminem]
You
never
met
me
and
you'll
probably
never
see
me
again
But
I
know
you,
the
name's
Slim
You
want
revenge?
Then
don't
shoot,
I'm
in
the
same
boots
as
you
I'm
telling
the
truth,
I
got
a
price
on
my
head,
too
Cuz
when
you
1
-
Ride
like
a
cowboy
toward
the
sun
When
life
ain't
fun,
when
you're
on
the
run
Got
your
gold
and
you
got
your
gun
But
life
as
an
outlaw
just
begun
Got
your
shotgun
by
your
side
Got
your
horse
and
you
got
your
pride
You
ride
'till
there
ain't
no
place
to
hide
It's
sad
cuz
the
bad
guys
always
die
[Dre]
He
was
shady,
could
see
it
by
the
look
on
his
face
He
said
take
ten
paces,
shit,
I
took
eight
Spun
around
and
I
aimed
straight
for
the
brain
My
shit
went
bang
but
it
only
fired
a
blank,
he
said
[Eminem]
You
need
bullets,
hurry
up
run
[Dre]
I
put
a
clip
in
the
gun,
and
pointed
at
his
lungs
He
pulled
two
at
the
same
time
and
stood
stunned
[Eminem]
Go
ahead,
shoot
me,
but
I'm
not
the
one
you
want
[Dre]
I
figured
he
was
telling
the
truth
That's
why
I
didn't
shoot
So
what
we
gonna
do?
It's
on
you
[Eminem]
Do
you
recall
when
you
and
Snoop
was
a
group?
[Dre]
The
Chronic
[Eminem]
Well,
all
we
gotta
do
is
find
a
map
to
part
two
And
plus
I
know
who's
got
it
(Who?)
Some
old
dude,
he's
got
26
plagues
and
he
already
sold
two
[Dre]
Loaded
up
my
saddle,
got
ready
for
battle
Hid
two
pieces
of
gold
inside
of
my
saddle
We
rolled
two
miles
until
we
hit
the
spot
An
old
ghost
town
that
everybody
forgot
A
place
where
they
used
to
smoke
chronic
a
lot
Slim
grabbed
the
shotgun
[Eminem]
Dre,
here's
the
plot
This
is
the
spot,
they
call
him
Doc
Loveless
He's
going
around
saying
he
took
the
game
from
us
[Dre]
Let's
shoot
him
in
his
kneecaps,
he'll
never
see
it
coming
[Eminem]
He
ain't
got
no
legs,
they
cut
'em
off
at
the
stomach
He's
got
mechanical
legs
and
spins
webs
Plus
he's
well
respected
by
the
hip-hop
heads
Our
mission
is
to
get
him
to
stop
laying
eggs
And
we
can
put
him
on
his
back
down
a
flight
of
steps
[Dre]
I
drew
two
guns,
spun
them
on
my
fingers
Kicked
the
swinging
doors
in
and
started
gun
slinging
I
could
hear
somebody
singing
It
sounded
like
a
G
Thang
in
a
verse
from
Keep
Their
Heads
Ringing
I
said
it's
Dre's
Day
and
started
to
spray
It's
eighteen
hundred,
he
proves
a
AK
Hollow
tips
started
flying
every
which
way
[Eminem]
That's
when
I
seen
Dre
in
trouble,
then
came
the
brigades
I
fired
the
first
shot,
spun
his
body
around
He
hit
the
ground
and
landed
upside
down
Dre
grabbed
the
map,
the
plagues
and
the
gold
I
grabbed
two
girlies
and
a
blunt
that's
rolled
Repeat
1
Repeat
1
Always
die
The
Wild
Gotham
The
Wild
West
Ah
ha,

can
afford
Otherwise
I
might
get
sent
up
back-strike
in
a
Ford
And
you
wonder
what
the
fuck
I
need
more
Vicadin
for
Everybody's
pissin'
me
off;
even
the
No
Limit
Tank
looks
like
a
middle
finger
sideways
flippin
me
off
No
shit
I'm
a
great
danger
to
my
health
Why
else
would
I
kill
you
then
jump
in
the
grave
and
bury
myself?
[Chorus
Two]
{Just
pull
the
plug!}
People
say
that
I'm
a
bad
influence
I
say
the
world's
already
fucked,
I'm
just
addin
to
it
They
say
I'm
suicidal,
teenagers'
newest
idol
{c'mon!}
C'mon
do
as
I
do,
go
ahead
get
mad
and
do
it
{Just
let
it
gooo!}

[Eminem]
I'm
the
illest
rapper
to
hold
the
cordless,
patrollin
corners
Looking
for
hookers
to
punch
in
the
mouth
with
a
roll
of
quarters
I'm
meaner
in
action
than
Roscoe
beatin
James
Todd
Sr.
across
the
back
with
vacuum
cleaner
attachments
{Ow!
Ow!
Ow!}
I
grew
up
in
a
wild
hood,
as
a
hazardous
youth
with
a
fucked
up
childhood,
that
I
used
as
an
excuse
And
ain't
shit
changed,
I
kept
the
same
mindstate
since
the
third
time
that
I
failed
9th
grade
You
probably
think
that
I'm
a
negative
person,
don't
be
so
sure
of
it
I
don't
promote
violence,
I
just
encourage
it
{c'mon}
I
laugh
at
the
sight
of
death
as
I
fall
down
a
cement
flight
of
steps
{ahhhhhhhh!}
and
land
inside
a
bed
of
spider
webs
So
throw
caution
to
the
wind;
you
and
a
friend
can
jump
off
of
a
bridge
and
if
you
live,
do
it
again
Shit,
why
not,
blow
your
brain
out,
I'm
blowin
mine
out
Fuck
it,
you
only
live
once,
you
might
as
well
die
now!
[Chorus
Three]
{Just
let
it
gooo!}
People

[Eminem]
My
laser
disc
gon'
make
you
take
a
razor
to
your
wrist
Make
you
satanistic,
make
you
take
the
pistol
to
your
face
and
place
the
clip
and
cock
it
back
and
let
it
go
until
your
brains
are
rippin
out
your
skull
so
bad
to
sew
you
back
would
be
a
waste
of
stitches
I'm
not
a
"Role
Model,"
I
don't
wanna
babysit
kids
I
got
one
little
girl,
and
Hailey
Jade
is
Shady's
business
And
Shady's
just
an
alias
I
made
to
make
you
pissed
off
Where
the
fuck
were
you
when
Gil
was
paid
to
make
me
dishwash?
I
make
a
couple
statements
and
now
look
how
crazy
shit
got
You
made
me
get
a
bigger
attitude
than
eighty
Kim
Scott's
And
she
almost
got
the
same
fate
that
Grady's
bitch
got
I
knew
that
"Just
the
Two
of
Us"
would
make
you
hate
me
this
much
And
"Just
the
Two
of
Us,"
that
ain't
got
shit
to
do
with
us
and
our
personal
life,
it's
just
words
on
a
mic
So
you
can
call
me
a
punk,
a
pervert
or
a
chauvinist
pig
But
the
funny
shit
is
that
I
still
go
with
the
bitch!
[Chorus
Two]
[Intro:]
Ready
or
ride!
[scratches]
Do
it!
[scratches]
Eat
'em
up!
[scratches]
Do
it!
[scratches]
[x4]
[Verse
1:]
Sneakin'
in
through
the
back
door
-
freaky
MC's
get
ambushed
Rammed
and
squooshed
slammed
and
pushed,
crammed
and
mushed.
Then
I'm
movin'
on
down
from
the
right
to
left,
So
bite
the
meth
or
prepare
to
fiht
to
death
To
jacked,
attacked
and
cracked
on
two,
Smackin'
through
'ril
you're
black
and
blue
for
actin'
true!
I'm
dreaded
like
a
man
whose
hair
is
all
stands,
Proof
that
I
be
sniffin'
on
aerosol
cans.
I'm
stompin'!
I'm
kickin'!
I'm
chokin'!
I'm
stampin'
'em
Clopin'
'em!
Stcikin'
and
pokin'
and
clampin'
'em,
To
electric
chairs
and
tightenin'
bolts
Hit
'em
with
frightening
jolts
of
lightning
bolts!
I'm
zappin'!
-
Rappers,
singers
and
daneers
Faster
than
you
could
snap
your
fingers
for
ransom.
Cancer
is
in
the
fleshm
alive
and
breathin'
Survivin'
by
connivin
and
theivin,
[Chorus:]
Ready
or
ride!
[scratches]
Do
it!
[scratches]
Eat
'em
up!
[scratches]
Do

[Verse
2:]
I
had
a
dream
I
was
gettin'
jacked
by
biters
It
felt
like
I
was
bein
attacked
by
spiders.
Developin'
a
fear
of
biterphobia
I'm
holdin'
a
gas
can
and
lighter
over
ya!
If
I
detect
ya!
-
I'm
a
pulverize
Dissect
your
brain,
diggin'
in
your
skulls
for
lies,
And
I'm
a
torture
-
with
material
iller
That
a
stark
ravin'
mad
serial
killer!
But
I'm
more
dangerous
-
than
a
loaded
chamber
is
A
major
risk
to
a
plagiarist!
So
beware
of
the
aira!
A
terror
for
horrible,
Will
scare
ya
tomorrow
is
the
airbone
assault
of
rappers.
Hit
the
source
to
better
my
skills,
I
head
for
the
border
And
run
Galloping
Hills,
The
choice
is
yours!
Cause
now
buddy's
noises
force
me
to
scream
'til
my
voice
is
hoarse
Cause
I'm
sick
of
these
jabber
jaws
and
crap
that
grab
at
yours
And
savage
yours
to
bite
like
Labradors!
In
the
range
of
my
double-barrel
And
your
like
is
in
danger,
trouble
and
peril!
[Chorus:]
Ready
or
ride!
[scratches]
Do
it!
[scratches]
Eat
'em
up!
[scratches]
Do
it!
[scratches]
[x4]
[Verse
3:]
I
trample
and
stamp
liars,
likethey
werr
campfires,
Cause
vampires
right
on
my
balls
like
clamp
pliers.
And
swing
on
my
thingamajig
So
I'm
bringin'
my
nig
Proof
for
backup
when
I
sing
at
my
gig.
Cause
biters
are
fallin'
head
over
heels
In
love
with
every
rhyme
that
I've
said
over
reels,
That's
how
I
became
paranoid,
Chewin'
my
fingernails,
pullin'
my
hair
annoyed!
Cause
every
time
you
bit
it
was
deliberate
So
I'm
forced
to
hit
a
little
quicker
with
An
ultimatum!
I
assault
and
slayed
'em
With
rhymes
and
it's
ultimatum
just
to
cultivate
'em!
Energetic
and
imaginative,
Pronouns
and
verbsm
predicates
and
adjectives
Will
reach
out
and
grab
ya,
nine
times
outta
ten
That's
why
I'm
spilling
one
of
a
kind
rhymes
out
a
pen!
[Chorus:]
Everybody
walk
out
the
back
door!
[scratches]
Everybody
walk
out
the
ba-a-ack
door!
[scratches]

[beat

Marshall!
Sounds
like
an
SOS
Holy
wack
unlyrical
lyrics,
Andre,
you're
fucking

To
the
Rapmobile

let's
go!
(Marshall!
Marshall!)
Bitches

gentlemen!
It's
showtime!
Hurry

Introducing
the
star
of
our
show
His
name
is
(Marshall!)
You
wouldn't
want
to
be
Anywhere
else
in
the
world
right
now
So
without
further
ado,
I
bring
to
you
(Marshall!)
You
'bout
to
witness
hip-hop
in
its
most
purest
Most
rawest
form,
flow
almost
flawless
Most
hardest,
most
honest
known
artist
Chip
off
the
old
block,
but
old
Doc
is
(back)
Looks
like
Batman
brought
his
own
Robin
Oh
God,
Saddam's
got
his
own
Laden
With
his
own
private
plane,
his
own
pilot
Set
to
blow
college
dorm
rooms
doors
off
the
hinges
Oranges,
peach,
pears,
plums,
syringes
Vrinn,
vrinn!
Yeah,
here
I
come,
I'm
inches
Away
from
you,
dear,
fear
none
Hip-hop
is
in
a
state
of
9-1-1,
so
Let's
get
down
to
business
I
don't
got
no
time
to
play
around,
what
is
this?
Must
be
a
circus
in
town,
let's
shut
the
shit
down
On
these
clowns;
can
I
get
a
witness?
(Hell
yeah!)

Gee

Dre,
"Holy

Look
at
all
the
bullshit
that
goes

In
Gotham
when
I'm
gone
Time
to
get
rid
of
these
rap
criminals
So
skip
to
your
lou
while
I
do
what
I
do
best
You
ain't
even
impressed
no
more,
you're
used
to
it
Flows
too
wet,
nobody
close
to
it
Nobody
says
it
but
still
everybody
knows
the
shit
The
most
hated
on
out
of
all
those
who
say
they
get
hated
on
in
eighty
songs
and
exaggerate
it
all
so
much
They
make
it
all
up,
there's
no
such
thing
Like
a
female
with
good
looks
who
cooks
and
cleans
It
just
means
so
much
more
to
so
much
more
People
when
you're
rappin'
and
you
know
what
for
The
show
must
go
on;
so
I'd
like
to
welcome
y'all
To
Marshall
and
Andre's
carnival,
c'mon!
Now
let's
get
down
to
business
I
don't
got

to
play
around,
what
is
this?
Must
be

On

(Hell

It's
just
like
old
times,
the
Dynamic
Duo
Two
old
friends,
why
panic?
You
already
know
Who's
fully
capable,
the
two
caped
heroes
Dial
straight
down
the
center,
eight-zero-zero
You
can
even
call
collect,
the
most
feared
duet
Since
me
and
Elton
played
career
Russian
Roulette
And
never
even
see
me
blink
or
get
to
bustin'
a
sweat
People
steppin'
over
people
just
to
rush
to
the
set
Just
to
get
to
see
an
MC
who
breathes
so
freely
Ease
over
these
beats
and
be
so
breezy
Jesus,
how
can
shit
be
so
easy?
How
can
one
Chandra
be
so
Levy?
Turn
on
these
beats,
MC's
don't
see
me
Believe
me,
BET
and
MTV
Are
gonna
grieve
when
we
leave,
dog,
fo'
sheezy
Can't
leave
rap
alone,
the
game
needs
me
'Til
we
grow
beards,
get
weird
and
disappear
Into
the
mountains,
nothin'
but
clowns
down
here
But
we
ain't
fuckin'
around
round
here
Yo,
Dre
(What
up?)
Can
I
get
a
"hell
yeah"?
(Hell
yeah!)
Now
let's
get
down
to
business
I
don't
got
no
time
to

Must

So
there
you
have
it,
folks
(Marshall!)
has
come
to
save
the
day
Back
with
his
friend
Andre
Here
to
remind
you
that
bullshit
does
not
pay
Because
(Marshall!)
and
Andre
are
here
to
stay
And
never
go
away,
until
our
dying
day
Until
we're
old
and
grey
(Marshall!)
So
until
next
time,
friends
Same
blonde
hair,
same
rap
channel
Good
night,
everyone!
Thank
you
for
coming!
Your
host
for
the
evening
(Marshall!)
Oh!
Heh
Jumped
out
of
the
second
floor
of
a
record
store...
With
a
Treacherous
Four
cassette
and
a
cassette
recorder
In
Ecuador
with
Edward
Norton
Witness
the
metamorphosis
Of
a
legend
growin'
like
an
expert
swordsman
From
the
Hessian
War
and
Hence
the
origin
of
the
Headless
Horseman
Born
with
the
endorphins
of
a
pathetic
orphan
Endless
sores
and
reservoir
Of
extension
cords
in
dresser
drawers
And
deadbolts
on
the
bedroom
doors
And
sexual
torture
kits
kept
in
a
separate
storage
bin
Excellent
boyfriend
Use
intercourse
to
settle
scores
With
women
who
have
been
vendettas
towards
men
D*ckhead
is
forced
in
and
the
shredded
foreskin
Red

torn
and
they're
only
bein'
fed
a

Bed
sores
in
sore
shins
Pregnant
whores
can
get
abortions
Fetish
for
stickin'
metal
forks
in,
self-absorption
Skeletor,
I
went
to
Hell
and
fell
a
floor
A
predator,
I'm
headed
for
competitors
Better
warn
'em,
what
I
lack
in
tact
and
a
set
of
morals
I
make
up
for
in
metaphors
like
a
cosmetic
store
Stegosaurus,
Chuck
Norris
with
a
thesaurus
Yes,
of
course,
I
mess
up
once
You
want
some?
Come
and
get
some,
boys!
I'm
givin'
Daniel
Pantaleo
a
refresher
course
On
excessive
force
and
pressure
points
And
dressin'
George
Zimmerman
in
a
fluorescent
orange
Dress
and
four
inch
heels
to
address
the
court
With
a
bullseye
on
his
back,
his
whole
chest
and
torso
Are
left
on
the
doorsteps
of
Trayvon's
dad
as
a
present
for
him
In
my
present
form
I'm
Desert
Storm
Appetite
for
destruction
is
no
suppressant
for
Aggressive,
forceful,
and
less
remorseful
in
every
morsel
Unpleasant,
horrible;
hello,
gorgeous!
The
rebel
with
devil
horns
just
fell
off
the
yellow
short
bus
Met
a
contortionist,
said,
"When
you
wanna
get
sexual?"
She
said,
"However
I
fit
in
your
schedule.
I'm
flexible."
Expired
tags
on
the

got
Catherine
Bach
In
the
back
in
Daisy
Dukes
with
the
hazards
on
At
a
traffic
stop
gettin'
harassed,
sign
an
autograph
For
this
asshole
cop's
daughter
Laugh
'cause
I
called
her
a
brat
on
it
He
spat
on
it
and
brought
it
back
lookin'
half
in
shock
Had
a
heart
attack
and
dropped
dead
Started
fallin'
back
with
it
And
got
slapped
with
a
Colin
Kaepernick
practice
sock
One
ball
and
half
a
di*k,
Apple
Watch
Crack
for
an
axle,
walked
in
a
Bass
Pro
Shop
with
David
Hasselhoff,
pulled
Tabasco
sauce
out
of
my
satchel
Knocked
over
a
fisherman's
tackle
box
and
*crash
sound*
Asked
if
they
had
a
laugh
in
stock
That
was
f*ckin'
stupid
You
got
it
twisted,
all
'cause
I
offered
this
b*tch
A
doggie
biscuit,
you
call
me
misogynistic
B*tch,
get
to
massagin'
this
di*k!
Like
spas
in
this
b*tch,
slob
on
it,
with
gobs
of
lipstick
Got
a
shoppin'
list
for
you
to
run
some
odds
and
ends
with
It's
not
a
b*tch
on
this
earth
I
can
be
monogamous
with
She's
non-existent
Robin
Thicke
with
a
throbbin'
d*ck
on
some
swab
and
slick
sh*t
But
I
shout
derogatives
at
b*tches
like
f*ckin'
missile
launches
Misfit,
blond
and
nitwit
Like
I've
gone
ballistic,
with
a
frostin'
tip
kit
Screamed,
"I
hate
blondes,"
and
became
one,
I'm
optimistic
Love
to
start
sh*t
Shovin'
Clark
Kent's
undergarments
in
the
glove
compartment
Of
the
bucket,
bumpin'
Bubba
Sparxxx
I'm
double
parkin'
up
at
Targets,
trouble
'cause
a
double
cross
The
shadiest
mothaf**ka
you'll
ever
come
across
Olympic
gymnast,
been
known
for
some
assaults
A
couple
lawsuits,
enough
to
cause
a
stomach
ulcer
Same
damn
brain
scan
results
as
Rainman's
is
Something's
awful
when
Dustin
Hoffman's
Dressin'
up
in
your
mummy
costume
On
stage
dancin'
to
"Brain
Damage",
what's
the
problem?
Nothing's
wrong,
the
name
brand
is
back
to
reclaim
status
Run
the
faucet,
I'ma
dunk
A
bunch
of
Trump
supporters
underwater
Snuck
up
on
'em
in
Ray
Bans
in
a
gray
van
with
a
spray
tan
It's
a
wrap,
like
an
Ace
bandage
Don't-give-a-f*k
persona,
to
my
last
DNA
strand
E&J
in
the
waistband,
at
the
VMAs
with
the
stagehand
She
wants
kielbasa,
pre-arrange
an
escape
plan
Three-inch
blade
on
point,
like
a
See-and-Say
Consider
me
a
dangerous
man
But
you
should
be
afraid
of
this
dang
candidate
You
say
Trump
don't
kiss
ass
like
a
puppet
'Cause
he
runs
his
campaign
with
his
own
cash
for
the
fundin'
And
that's
what
you
wanted
A
f**kin'
loose
cannon
who's
blunt
with
his
hand
on
the
button,
who
doesn't
have
to
answer
to
no
one

great
idea!
If
I
was
president,
gettin'
off
is
The
first
order
of
business
once
I
get
in
office
Second
thing
that'll
make
me
happy's
walkin'
up
to
Uncle
Sam
Naked,
laughing,
d*ck
cupped
in
hand
Screaming,
"F*ck
safe
sex!"
Throw
a
latex
and
an
AIDS
test
at
him
Tell
Congress
I
run
this
land
And
I
want
the
rubber
banned,
and
make
it
snappy
Addiction
to
friction
and
static
Addict
who
can't
escape
the
habit
It's
in
you
to
chase
the
dragon
But
as
fate
would
have
it,
I
walked
up
in
major
Magics
Dressed
as
the
maintenance
man
In
a
laser
tag
vest
and
a
racin'
jacket,
with
a
gauge
to
blast
it
And
sped
away
in
the
station
wagon
Stacey
Dash's
and
Casey
Anthony's
Crazy
asses
in
the
backseat
Throwin'
Stay-Free
pads
at
me
Dead
passenger
in
the
passenger
seat
Unfasten
the
safety
latches
And
slam
on
the
brakes
in
traffic
so
hard
I
snapped
the
relocation
brackets
for
the
monster
tires
Finna
get
a
murder
case
and
catch
it
Like
you
threw
it
at
me
encased
in
plastic
And
send
Dylan
Roof
through
the
windshield
of
the
Benz
Until
he
spins
like
a
pinwheel
and
begins
feelin'...
Like
a
windmill
with
a
thin
bill
while
his
skin's
peelin'
And
skids
'til
he
hits
a
cement
pillar
Swing
for
the
fence
like
Prince
Fielder
Knock
it
into
the
upper
peninsula
You
want
to
go
against
zilla?
The
Rap
God
When
will
I
quit?
Never
been
realer
The
in-stiller
of
fear,
not
even
a
scintilla
of
doubt
Whose
pens
iller
than
Prince
in
a
chinchilla
Or
Ben
Stiller
in
a
suspense
thriller
Revenge
killer
of
bin
syllable
binge
Fill
a
syringe,
till
I
Draw
first
blood
Even
pop
s*it
on
my
pop
s*it,
and
it's
popular
Couldn't
be
more
awkwarder
Cause
you're
innocence
I
robbed
you
of
It's
my
fingers
that
got
stuck
up
Tortured
a,
not
give
a
Slapstick,
hockey
puck
The
broad
hunter
with
the
sawed
off
Like
an
arm
when
it's
lopped
off
of
ya
But
I'm
not
gonna,
get
the
shotgun
Or
the
Glock,
I'm
gonna
opt
for
the
ox
Cause
I'm
into
objects
that
are
sharp
when
I
sharpen
It's
not
a
shock,
I'm
such
an
obnoxious
f*cker
The
rock
cuts
into
rock
cause
who
would
have
thought
This
much
of
a
cocksucker
that
go
across
the
buttocks
of
Vivica
Fox
with
a
box
cutter
That
was
for
50,
little
slap
on
the
wrist
be
warned
I'm
unrevealing
quickly
My
squabbles,
I'm
grappling
with
your
time
traveling
with
me
Try
and
follow,
as
I
wobble,
relapse
into
history,
with
a
flask
of
the
whiskey
Tip
it
back
then
I'm
twisting
wine
bottles
Like
what
happened
to
Chris
Reeves'
spine
column
That's
the
plan
of
attack
when
I'm
fixing
my
problems
Wish
my
chest
wasn't
having
to
get
these
rhymes
off
'em
But
the
fact
that
I
have
so
many
rappers
against
me
mind
boggles
And
why
I
had
to
come
back
on
these
faggots
who
diss
me
is
More
of
a
spectacular
mystery
than
a
f*cking
Agatha
Christie
crime
novel
But
my
patience
is
wearing
thin
Swear
I
been
contemplating
rubbing
sh*t
in
your
face
till
I
smear
it
in
Diss
you
in
every
lyric
until
you
fear
the
pen
And
never
appear
again
If
you
actually
had
f*cking
careers
to
end
But
then
I
think
of
Molly
Qerim
and
I
steer
'em
in
that
direction
and
forget
my
ideas
for
them
Molly,
I'm
gone
off
you
Man,
light
some
kush
You're
my
first
take,
I'll
nail
you
Can't
lie,
I
gush
If
I
won
you
over,
you
would
be
the
grand
prize
I'm
entranced
by
your
looks,
come
and
give
the
Shady
franchise
a
push
You
can
get
it
in
a
can
like
some
Anheuser
Busch
Jeans
too
small,
least
three
pant
sizes
tush
Mushed
against
your
damn
side,
you
puss
And
thighs
are
squooshed
What
kind
of
attires
that?
I'm
ready
to
be
rode
Psychopath,
bet
you
we'll
get
it
popping
like
a
flat
Light
the
match
to
ignite
the
wrath
Got
knives
to
slash
and
slice
hermaphrodites
in
half
Piper
Chapmans
might
just
have
to
picket
me
Like
a
scab
Hard
to
describe
in
fact
Startling
violent
perhaps
Are
things
that
come
to
mind
as
soon
as
I
start
spitting
rhymes
like
that
And
you
aren't
really
surprised
at
that
But
as
far
as
these
lines
I
rap
And
these
bars,
wouldn't
dial
it
back
if
I
star
69'ed
the
track.
Instinctive
nature,
to
bring
the
anguish
(yeah)
to
the
English
language
With
this
ink,
you
haters
get
wrote
on
like
a
piece
of
paper
This
rap
shit
got
me
travelin'
place
to
place,
you
barely
leave
your
house
'Cause
you're
always
stuck
at
your
pad,
it's
stationary
Yeah,
that's
why
when
I
brainstorm,
gotta
write
it
out
Simon
Cowell
of
rhymin'
foul,
that's
why
you
sound
so
shook
Wire
bound
notebook
got
tied
around
your
throat
Hook
it
inside
your
mouth,
go
"HRUHHH"
That's
what
it's
like
when
the
mic
is
out
'Cause
I'm
tearin'
at
your
flesh
with
it
'Til
your
larynx
and
neck
are
split
With
these
lyrics,
weapons
expert
with
Like
hair
extensions,
extra
clips
And
you're
scared
to
effin'
death
of
it
Bitch,
you're
starin'
at
a
legend
that
In
a
pair
of
Sketcher,
sweatshirt
ripped
And
hoodie
black,
should
be
strapped
to
a
chair
or
stretcher
Electric,
swear
on
every
record,
bitch
Finger
so
high
in
the
air,
I
bet
your
senses
flip
Like
a
barometric
pressure
switch
Carin'
less
who
I
offend
with
this
I'm
at
your
neck
like
Pez
dispense
Go
'head,
spit
your
flow,
bitch...
I'm
at
your
throat
like
chloraseptic,
'septic
And
you
got
strep,
I'm
too
complex
with,
'plex
with
This
shit
I
wrote
is
on
some
next
shit,
next
shit
I'm
at
your
throat,
I'm
feelin'
reckless,
reckless,
yeah
And
I'll
take
a
hundred
of
you,
hundred
of
you
All
at
once
like
I
had
nothin'
to
lose,
what
can
I
do?
My
appetite
for
destruction
is
loose,
destruction
is
loose
And
all
at
once
just
to
have
somethin'
to
chew,
somethin'
to
chew
Somethin'
to
chew
Yeah,
uh
And
still
conjoined
at
the
hip
with
hop
Still
on
point
and
poignant
Skilled
as
Floyd
is
And
it's
filled
and
still
no
filter,
boy
I'll
put
you
in
your
place
(yeah)
like
a
realtor,
boy
You
still
ain't
in
the
buldin',
boy
I
will
destroy
shit,
even
as
I
build
it
Get
the
drill
bit,
pen
is
filled
with
poison
Which
is
the
source,
easy
to
still
pinpoint
it
Like
what?
Like
a
real
thin
joint,
it
What?
Comes
on
Quilted
Northern
And
what?
In
a
built-in
toilet
Yeah,
bitch
I
told
you
I'm
a
dog
(woof,
woof)
I
wouldn't
heal
with
ointment
Way
I'm
kickin'
these
fairies
tails
Should
write
a
children's
storybook
(yeah)
Million
voices
in
my
head,
but
still
get
a
little
bit
of
thrill
And
some
real
enjoyment
Off
what?
Off
the
feel
of
going
in
Like?
Like
your
bitch
when
she
gives
me
brain
Like
she
thinks
I'm
dumb
Grabs
the
crown
of
my
dick
and
blows
me
to
kingdom
come
'Til
I
feel
anointed
She
makes
iller
noises
When
she's
with
me,
must
be
from
the
Windy
City
Pretty
apparent,
she's
a
M.I.L.F.
when
blowin'
me
'Cause
like
Kandor
and
two,
rippin'
the
condom
in
two,
woo!
Dick
is
a
bargain
or
two,
now
I'm
gettin'
blue
like
Kolonopins
Rude
Jude
I
go
there,
you
wouldn't
Well,
I
still
have
a
few
views,
and
comment
on
you
Just
not
YouTube,
'cause...
I'm
at
your
throat
like
chloraseptic,
'septic
And
you
got
strep,
I'm
too
complex
with,
'plex
with
This
shit
I
wrote
is
on
some
next
shit,
next
shit
I'm
at
your
throat,
I'm
feelin'
reckless,
reckless,
yeah
You're
a
has-been
That
has
been
the
case
since
back
when
You
last
went
and
threw
your
hat
in
the
race
You've
been
trash
Stick
your
raps
in
the
trash
bin
Or
end
up
in
my
next
rhyme
You're
a
fuckboy,
so
next
time
It's
gonna
be
heads
flyin'
like
Dez
Bryant
With
a
TEC-9
against
Rex
Ryan,
yeah!
Now
watch
me
set
it
like
correct
time
All
you
get
is
sloppy
seconds
like
a
Timex
I
Clock
rejects
into
the
next
life
Talkin'
reckless,
that
is
just
my
Strongest
suit,
but
you
can
get
my
Columbian
neck
tie
Prostitute
just
climb
in
the
Humvee
and
lets
ride
Why
you
hitching
at
night?
I
put
an
end
to
your
life
(sex
crime)
Kidding
aside,
insidious
vibe
Girl,
you
know
you
got
the
prettiest
eyes
But
all
you're
getting
is
bribe
Ending
your
life
to
try
to
get
you
inside
Then
we
gon'
end
up
spending
the
night
And
I'm
skinning
your
hide
like
an
Indian
tribe
What
kind
of
nut
drives
a
Budweiser
truck
Finds
a
slut,
tries
to
surprise
her,
cuffs,
ties
her
Up,
binds
up,
cuts,
slices
her
twice
But
the
muff
diver
must
just
like
it
rough
Fuck
right
in
her
vagina,
blood
Flies
up,
under
thighs,
ugh,
like
a
geyser,
uh
Music,
please
Enthusiast,
of
the
roofie
Goal
is
to
get
a
floozie
inside
the
jacuzzi
And
have
a
loosie,
goosey
as
coozie
is
with
an
Uzi
But
I
am
to
rap
what
blue
jeans
mean
to
Bruce
Springsteen
Glued
me
be,
I'm
truTV,
you're
too
PG
I'm
Schoolly
D,
you're
spoony,
G
No
diss
there,
just
notice
there
are
no
similarities
that
we
share
Besides
the
fact
we
breathe
air
Happily
married,
to
rap
and
I'm
glad
that
we
buried
The
hatchet
and
patched
it
up
Now
I'm
back
to
ratchet
up
my
attack
And
I'm
at
your
mothafuckin'
throat
like...
Chloraseptic,
'septic
And
you
got
strep,
I'm
too
complex
with,
'plex
with
This
shit
I
wrote
is
on
some
next
shit,
next
shit
I'm
at
your
throat,
I'm
feelin'
reckless,
reckless,
yeah
And
I'll
take
a
hundred
of
you,
hundred
of
you
All
at
once
like
I
had
nothin'
to
lose,
what
can
I
do?
My
appetite
for
destruction
is
loose,
destruction
is
loose
And
all
at
once
just
to
have
somethin'
to
chew,
somethin'
to
chew
Somethin'
to
chew
Yo,
alright,
yo
I'm
possessed
by
evil
demons
that
torture
me
while
I'm
sleeping
I
keep
dreaming
of
death
and
I'm
hearing
people
screaming
The
devil's
spirit's
trapped
inside
me
and
I
want
it
out
I'm
on
the
couch
bleeding
to
death
in
a
haunted
house
With
both
of
my
wrists
slit,
I'm
lifted
up
in
the
air
And
suspended
in
animation
like
someone's
holding
me
there
I
feel
somebody's
cold
hands
wrapping
around
my
neck
While
I
choke
on
my
own
blood
that
I
swallow
and
drown
to
death
But
I
found
a
breath
and
somehow
managed
to
slip
the
clutches
Nearly
blacking
out
from
dizziness
and
head
rushes
Tripping
over
OD'd
bodies
of
dead
lushes
Bloodstains
paint
the
plush
carpet
like
red
blushes
Door's
open
and
close
by
themselves,
books
fly
off
shelves
Curtains
catch
fire,
the
house
melts
My
skin
blisters
and
sticks
together
like
twin
sisters
The
wind
blows
and
shatters
windows
like
ten
twisters
Caught
a
piece
of
shrapnel
in
the
Adam's
apple
Two
cups
of
holy
water
and
I'm
looking
at
'em
half
full
But
as
soon
as
I
go
to
touch
'em
they
turn
into
red
rum
It
got
silent,
then
all
these
voices
said
"Come
follow
me
into
the
pits
of
Hell"
I
heard
'em
yell
"Welcome
to
the
Norman
Bates
Motel!"
I
ring
the
bell
for
service
and
I
was
greeted
by
his
mother
Covered
in
dry
blood,
head
still
dented
from
the
shovel
I
said
I
need
a
room
so
I
could
try
to
get
some
rest
She
gave
me
the
keys
to
the
best
suite
and
a
bag
of
cess
And
told
me
that's
just
for
starters,
Satan'll
be
in
to
see
me
later
To
see
if
I'm
interested
in
being
partners
(Thanks
to
Phantom
for
these
lyrics)
Fuck

chest
of
a
kamikaze

as
Ozzy
it's
obvious
you
can

closer
I'll
bite

advantage
I
catch

[Verse
1]
They
ask
me
am
I
ok
they
ask
me
if
I'm
happy
are
they
asking
me
that
because
of
the
shit
that's
been
thrown
at
me
or
am
I
just
a
little
snappy
and
they
genuinely
care
Doody,
most
of
my
life
its
just
been
me
and
you
there
and
I
continuosly
stare
at
pictures
of
you
I
never
got
to
say
I
love
you
as
much
as
I
wanted
to
but
I
do
yeah
I
say
it
now
and
you
can't
hear
me
what
the
fuck
good
does
that
do
me
now
but
somehow
I
know
you're
near
me
in
presence
oh
I
went
and
drop
some
presents
off
to
ease
it
to
them
two
little
beautiful
boys
of
yours
to
try
to
ease
their
minds
a
little
and
dawg
you'll
never
believe
this
but
Sharonda
actually
talks
to
me
now
Jesus
and
everyone
else
is
just
tryna
pick
up
the
pieces
man
how
you
touch
so
many
fucking
lives
and
just
leave
us
they
say
grievance
has
a
way
of
affecting
everyone
different
if
it's
true,
how
the
fuck
am
I
supposed
to
get
over
you
Difficult
as
it
sounds...
[Verse
2]
Doody,
that's
what
we
call
each
other
I
don't
know
where
it
came
from
but
it
just
stuck
with
us
we
was
always
brothers
never
thought
about
each
others'
skin
colours
til
one
day
we
was
walking
up
the
block
in
the
summer
it
was
like
90
degrees,
I
was
catching
a
sun
burn
tryna
walk
under
the
trees
just
to
give
me
some
comfort
I'm
moaning
I
just
wanna
get
home
when
I
look
over
and
your
shirt
is
off
I'm
like
you
gonna
fry
and
like
"No
I
wont,
I'm
black
stupid
and
black
people
they
got
melatonin
in
their
skin,
we
don't
burn"
meanwhile,
my
face
is
glowing
and
I
felt
like
I'm
on
fire
and
the
entire
time
you're
just
laughing
at
me
and
snapping
at
me
with
your
shirt,
bastard
and
I
still
have
to
get
you
back
for
that
shit
and
by
the
way
them
playboy
rings
my
mother
stole
from
you
well
Nate
finally
got
em
back
shit
it
must
have
been
at
least
16
years
ago
well
I
put
em
in
your
cask-ahhh
moving
past
it,
it
still
ain't
registered
yet
but
you
can
bet
your
legacy
they'll
never
forget
the
motor
city
motown
hip
hop
vet,
hip
hop
shop,
dreads
it
don't
stop
there
Yeah,
as
difficult
as
it
sounds...
[Verse
3]
And
this
may
sound
a
little
strange
but
I'mma
tell
it
I
found
that
jacket
that
you
left
at
my
wedding
and
I
picked
it
up
to
smell
it
I
wrapped
it
up
in
plastic
until
I
put
it
in
glass
and
hang
it
up
in
the
hallway
so
I
can
always
look
at
it
and
as
for
all
of
me
and
D12
we
feel
like
fuck
rap
it
feels
like
our
General
just
fucking
died
in
our
lap
we
shut
off
all
our
pages,
all
our
cell
numbers
has
changed
our
two-ways
are
in
the
trash
so
some
cats
will
have
to
find
a
new
way
and
I
know
that
it
feels
like
the
dreams
will
die
with
you
today
but
the
truth
is
there
all
still
here
and
you
ain't
Purple
Gang,
you
gotta
keep
pressing
on
don't
ever
give
up
the
dream
dawg
I
got
love
for
you
all
and
Doody,
it's
true
you
bought
people
together
who
never
woulda
been
in
the
same
room
if
it
wasn't
for
you
you
were
the
peacemaker
Doody
I
know
sometimes
you
were
moody
but
you
hated
confrontation
and
truly
hated
the
feuding
but
you
were
down
for
yours
whenever
it
came
to
scrapping
if
it
had
to
happen,
it
had
to
happen
believe
me,
I
know
you're
the
one
who
taught
me
to
throw
them
balls
back
on
Dresden
from
making
cars
to
paintballing
getting
arrested
to
sitting
across
from
each
other
in
cells
laughing
and
jesting
they
tried
to
hit
us
for
5
years
for
that,
no
question
I
guess
them
hookers
and
bums
that
we
shot
up
didn't
show
up
for
court
so
we
got
off
on
a
technicality,
left
sweating
me,
you
and
what's
his
face
I
forgot
his
fucking
name
shame
he
even
came
to
your
funeral
he
betrayed
our
team
and
if
I
see
him
again
I'ma
punch
him
in
the
fucking
face
and
that's
on
Hallie
Jade,
Whitney
Lane
and
Alaina's
name
I
let
the
pistol
bang
once
just
to
leak
a
shot
in
the
air
for
you
and
pour
some
liquor
out
for
you
with
Obie
in
the
parking
lot
of
54
just
before
we
were
supposed
to
get
in
cars
to
come
and
see
you
once
more
Difficult

it
sounds...

[Hook]
Livin'

Movin'

Only

gas
tank
But

finish
line,
so
I
can't
stop
now
I
don't
really
know
where
I'm
headed,
just
enjoyin'
the
ride
Just
gon'
roll
'til
I
drop
and
ride
'til
I
die
I'm
livin'
life
in
the
fast
lane
(Pedal

Paroles
de
la
chanson
Fuckin'
Backstabber
par
Eminem
(Song
is
hard
to
hear,
corrections
appreciated.
This
is
a
song
from
before
Eminem
was
famous)
*After
a
phone
call
between
Kim
and
Champtown,
the
song
begins*
[sample]
"Fuck
it,
Friends
or
no
friends
I
had
enough
bullshit
to
last
me
clear
to
the
ends"[4x]
[Eminem]
I
shoulda
been
able
to
see
that
you
were
the
one
behind
this
but
i
was
blind
as
fuck
to
see
that
you
were
the
kind
that
stuck
some
more
in
the
spine
this
It
was
another
friendship
broke
in
half
and
watch
you
turn
everything
into
a
game
and
joke
and
laugh
and
both
of
us
know
we
can?t
discuss
the
situation
I
just
hold
this
confrontation
just
revolts
and
accusations
and
insults
so
I?m
just
let
it
go
from
that
we
need
to
be
I
told
you
now,
from
that
what
goes
around
comes
back
around
believe
me,
duck
from
that,
come
here
you
fuckin?
[Chorus
:
Proof]
Come
here
you
fuckin
backstabber
why
I
oughta,
be
the
bitch
nigga
from
the
hood,
haha
come
here
you
fuckin
backstabber
why
i
oughta,
be
the
nigga
that?s
up
to
no
good,
haha

"Fuck
it,
Friends
or

enough
bullshit

the
ends"[2x]
[Eminem]
Take
a
second
to
stop
and
think
about
what
you
done
and
you
woulda
thought
that
being
a
friend,
Instead
of
what
you
won
All
because
of
what
you
run
your
mouth
you
wanna
prance
around
and
gloat?
Lets
see
how
well
you
dance
around
when
i
got
my
hands
around
your
throat
Cause
It?s
a
matter
of
time
till
I
get
my
blows
in
and
it
won?t
be
long
You
shouldn?t
go
walkin
around
and
stickin
your
nose
in
where
it
don?t
belong
Cause
everytime
you
talked
when
you
was
stretchin
the
truth
There?s
gonna
be
more
go
flyin
up
but
you
gonna
catch
it
in
2
come
here,
come
here
you
fuckin?
[Chorus
:
Proof]
Come
here
you
fuckin
backstabber
why
I
oughta,
be
the
bitch
nigga
from
the
hood,
haha
come
here
you
little
backstabber
why
i
oughta,
be
the
nigga
that?s
up
to
no
good,
haha

[Eminem]
Come
here
you
lil
double-crossing
goin
behind
my
back
snitchin
good
for
nothin
but
trouble
causin
instigating
fact
switcher
you
were
the
least
that
i
suspected
Until
the
puzzle
well
into
place
with
every
peice
that
I
selected
But
I?ll
never
let
that
crap
happen
again
You
come
backstabbin'
again
catch
it
smack
dab
in
the
chin
that?s
for
backstabbin
a
friend
cause
every
name
in
the
book
wouldn?t
be
enough
so
i
just
figured
I?d
say
your
name
in
the
hook
check
it
out,
come
here
you
fuckin?.
[Chorus
:
Proof]
Come
here
you
fuckin
backstabber
why
I
oughta,
be
the
bitch
nigga
from
the
hood,
haha
come
here
you
little

[Outro
:Proof]
Backstabbers
don?t
live
too
long
Around
my
way
friendships
betrayed
In
the
hood
you
die
for
that!
For
those
that
don?t
love
this
combat
and
verbally
say
this
This
could
relate
to
the
death
of
a
backstabber
That?s
like
the
desire
to
make
social
distant
vibration
combustion
of
the
neck
The
backstabber
for
the
female,
you
sleezin
ass
bitch
nigga!
So
remember,
the
backstabber
always
loses
in
the
end
A
friend
is
a
friend
to
the
end
F-R-I
for
Fri,
E-N-D
a
friend
for
the
end?..yes
To
eternity?..the
backstabber
shall
never
flourish
Take
em
out??.
[Eminem]
I
ain't
gonna
eat,
I
ain't
gonna
sleep
Ain't
gonna
breathe,
til
I
see,
what
I
wanna
see
And
what
I
wanna
see,
is
you
go
to
sleep,
in
the
dirt
Permanently,
you
just
being
hurt,
this
ain't
gonna
work
For
me,
it
just
wouldn't
be,
sufficient
enough
Cuz
we,
are
just
gonna
be,
enemies
As
long
as
we
breathe,
I
don't
ever
see,
either
of
us
Coming
to
terms,
where
we
can
agree
There
ain't
gonna
be,
no
reason,
speakin
wit
me
You
speak
on
my
seed,
then
me,
no
speakin
Englais
So
we
gonna
beef,
and
keep
on
beefin,
unless
You're
gonna
agree,
to
meet
with
me
in
the
flesh
And
settle
this
face
to
face,
and
you're
gonna
see
A
demon
unleashed
in
me,
that
you've
never
seen
And
you're
gonna
see,
this
gangsta
pee
on
himself
I
see
you
D-12,
and
thanks,
but
me
need
no
help
Me
do
this
one
all
by
my
lonely,
I
don't
need
fifteen
of
my
homies
When
I
see
you,
I'm
seeing
you,
me
and
you
only
We
never
met,
but
best
believe
you
gon'
know
me
When
I'm
this
close,
to
see
you
exposed
as
phony
Come
on,
bitch,
show
me,
pick
me
up,
throw
me
Lift
me
up,
hold
me,
just
like
you
told
me
You
was
gonna
do,
that's
what
I
thought,
you're
pitiful
I'm
rid
of
you,
all
you,
Ja,
you'll
get
it
too!
[Chorus]
Now
go
to
sleep
bitch!
Die,
motherfucker,
die!
Ugh,
time's
up,
bitch,
close
ya
eyes
Go
to
sleep,
bitch!
(what?)
Why
are
you
still
alive?
How
many
times
I
gotta
tell
ya,
close
ya
eyes?
And
go
to
sleep
bitch!
(what?)
Die
motherfucker
die,
bye,
bye,
motherfucker,
bye,
bye!
Go

sleep
bitch!
(what?)
Why
are
you
still
alive?
Why,

...Go

[Obie

We

you

On

to

You'se

when
You

overseein
the
Earth
Shady
muthafucka,
O.
Trice's
birth
And
as
I

I

a
curse
So
we
can
put
down
the
verse,
take
it
to
the
turf
Cock
and
squeeze,
and
he
who
reach
the
hearse
is
he
who
Depicts
fiction
in
his
verse
And
as
I
breathe,
and
you
be
deceased
The
world
believe
you
deceived
just
to
speak
You'se
not
the
streets,
you'se
the
desk
Use
not
your
chest
nigga,
use
a
vest
Before
two's
choose
ya
rest,
you
chose
death
Six
feet
deep,
nigga,
that's
the
depth
[Chorus]
[DMX]
Hey
dog,
I'ma
walk
like
a
beast,
talk
like
the
streets
I'ma
stay
blazin
New
York
wit
the
heat
Stalk
on
the
beat,
walk
wit
my
feet
Understand
my
pain,
the
rain
ain't
sweet
Peep
how
I'm
moving,
peep
where
I'm
going
Shit
don't
seep,
then
sleep
not
knowin
But
I'ma
keep
growing,
getting
larger
than
life
Easy-going
with
the
same
one
that
started
the
fight
He
be
knowing
how

when
dog

bite
Tried
to
show
him
the

shit,
it's
dog
for
life
Grand
champ,
and
my
Blood
Line
is
tight
Cuz
it's
all

it's
all
right
Niggas

to

but
couldn't
holla
back
Now

swallow,
everything

the
sac
Blood
Line,
and,
we
can
go
track

Damn

these
two
Adidas
and
beat
you
and
force
feed
you
'em
both,
and
on
each
feet
is
a
cleat
shoe
I'll
lift
you
off
your
feet
so
fast
with
a
roundhouse
you'll
think
I
pulled
the
fuckin
ground
out
from
underneath
you
(Bitch!)
I
ain't
no
fuckin
G,
I'm
a
cannibal
I
ain't
tryin
to
shoot
you,
I'm
tryin
to
chop
you
into
pieces
and
eat
you
Wrap
you
in
rope
and
plastic,
stab
you
with
broken
glass
and
have
you
with
open
gashes
strapped
to
a
soakin
mattress
Coke
and
acid,
black
magic,
cloaks
and
daggers
(ahhh!)
Fuck
the
planet,
until
it
spins
on
a
broken
axis
I'm
so
bananas
I'm
showin
up
to
your
open
casket
to
fill
it
full
of
explosive
gasses
and
close
it
back
with
a
lit
match
in
it
while
I
sit
back
and
just
hope
it
catches
Blow
you
to
fragments
Laugh,
roll
you
and
smoke
the
ashes
Chorus:
J-Black
(repeat
2X)
I
see
the
light
at
the
end
But
every
time
I
take
a
step,
it
gets
dim
Tell
me
is
this
hell
we're
livin
in?
If
so,
heaven's
got
to
be
better
But
if
we're
hellbound,
whatever,
let's
go
down
[J-Black]
Am
I
the
worst?
Because
I,
never
go
to
church
(never)
I
run
a
red
light
then
sideswipe
a
hearse
I'ma
drink
'til
my
liver
rot,
see
the
doc
Leave
the
E.R.,
then
hit
a
bar
for
a
liquor
shot,
'til
the
liver
spot
One
day
we
all
gon'
die
But
when
I
die,
I'ma
be
so
high
that
I'ma
get
up
and
walk,
leavin
the
concrete
bare
with
the
chalk
outline
still
there
I
smoke
'til
I
choke
and
I
sex
a
lot
I
got
a
cross
on
my
chain
but
it's
just
a
rock
Now
if
I
pray
everynight
(night)
Do
I
still
have
to
hold
my
trey
very
tight?
You
feel
me
God?
I
done
did
so
much
shit
while
on
Earth
I
smoke,
I
drink,
I
curse,
and
to
make
matters
worse
I
bust
my
gun
first,
and
then
I
chat
with
your
corpse
Since
way
back,
I
was
one
to
never
like
back-talk
See
me
at
the
pearly
gates
in
line,
wearin
a
Nordface
Nickle
nine
at
my
waist,
God
done
lost
faith
Angels
greet
me
but
I
don't
reply
back
Just
show
me
to
my
quarters,
and
oh
yeah,
where's
Thai
at?
Chorus
1/2
[Announcer]
Maxie
was
seriously
wounded
but
the
soul
still
burns
Final
battle,
fight!
[Masta
Ace]
Analyze
the
strength
of
my
game,
like
Lee
Corso
Call
me
a
lost
soul,
with
a
vest
on
my
torso
And
of
course,
yo,
y'all
know
I'm
no
stranger
to
danger
Like
Christ
in
a
manger,
feel
a
whole
range
of
my
anger
I
breathe
down
shit
so
hard
you
can
see
sound
And
beat
down
these
rap
clowns
in
like
three
rounds
My
pen
'bout
as
sharp
as
a
dagger,
walk
with
a
swagger
Tie
your
wife
to
the
back
of
a
black
Jag
and
I
drag
her
Ten
blocks,
untie
the
bitch
and
I
still
bag
her
Give
her
a
smack
in
the
ass
and
a
six
pack
of
lager
My
shit
go
as
deep
and
as
dark
as
a
train
tunnel
My
flows
spill
like
usin
the
wrong
end
of
a
funnel
Everyday
I
grow
more
older,
and
more
colder
Fly
you
to
Colorado,
roll
you
over
with
a
Boulder
I
know
you
want
to
retaliate
but
you
won't
dare
Cause
you
fuckin
with
some
niggaz
like
this
who
just
don't
care
Chorus
[J-Black]
But
every
time
I
take
a
step,
it
gets
dim..
Tell
me
is
this
hell
we're
livin
in?
Haha..
[Announcer]
Time's
up!
I'm
about
to
lose
my
mind
You've
been
gone
for
so
long
I'm
running
out
of
time
I
need
a
doctor
Call
me
a
doctor
I
need
a
doctor,
doctor
To
bring
me
back
to
life
I
told
the
World
one
day
I
would
pay
it
back
Say
it
on
tape,
and
lay
it,
record
it
So
that
one
day
I
could
play
it
back
But
I
don't
even
know
if
I
believe
it
when
I'm
saying
that
Ya'll
starting
to
creep
in,
everyday
it's
so
grey
and
black
Hope,
I
just
need
a
ray
of
that
Cause
no
one
see's
my
vision
when
I
play
it
for
'em
They
just
say
it's
wack
They
don't
know
what
dope
is
And
I
don't
know
if
I
was
awake
or
asleep
When
I
wrote
this,
All
I
know
is
you
came
to
me
when
I
was
at
my
lowest
You
picked
me
up,
breeding
life
in
me
I
owe
my
life
to
you
Before
the
life
of
me,
I
don't
see
why
you
don't
see
like
I
do
But
it
just
dawned
on
me
you
lost
a
son
See
this
light
in
you,
it's
dark.
Let
me
turn
on
the
lights
and
brighten
me
and
enlighten
you
I
don't
think
you
realise
what
you
mean
to
me
Not
the
slightest
clue
Cause
me
and
you
were
like
a
crew
I
was
like
your
sidekick
You
gon
either
wanna
fight
me
when
I
get
off
this
fucking
mic
Or
you
gon
hug
me
But
I'm
not
an
option,
there's
nothing
else
I
can
do
cause...
I'm
about
to
lose
my
mind
You've
been
gone
for
so
long
I'm
running
out
of
time
I
need
a
doctor
Call
me
a
doctor
I
need
a
doctor,
doctor
To
bring
me
back
to
life
It
hurts
when
I
see
you
struggle
You
come
to
me
with
ideas
You
say
there
just
pieces
so
I'm
puzzled
Cause
the
shit
I
hear
is
crazy
But
your
either
getting
lazy
or
you
don't
believe
in
you
no
more
Seems
like
your
own
opinions,
not
one
you
can
form
Can't
make
a
decision
you
keep
questioning
yourself
Second
guessing
and
it's
almost
like
your
begging
for
my
help
Like
I'm
your
leader
Your
susposed
to
fucking
be
my
mentor
I
can
endure
no
more,
I
demand
you
remember
who
you
are
It
was
YOU,
who
believed
in
me
When
everyone
was
telling
you
don't
sign
me
Everyone
at
the
fucking
label,
let's
tell
the
truth
You
risked
your
career
for
me
I
know
it
as
well
as
you
Nobody
wanted
to
fuck
with
the
white
boy
Dre,
I'm
crying
in
this
booth
You
saved
my
life,
now
maybe
it's
my
turn
to
save
yours
But
I
can
never
repay
you,
what
you
did
for
me
is
way
more
But
I
ain't
giving
up
faith
and
you
ain't
giving
up
on
me
Get
up
Dre,
I'm
dying,
I
need
you,
come
back
for
fuck's
sake
I'm
about
to
lose
my
mind
You've
been
gone
for
so
long
I'm
running
out
of
time
I
need
a
doctor
Call
me
a
doctor
I
need
a
doctor,
doctor
To
bring
me
back
to
life
Bring
me
back
to
life
Bring
me
back
to
life
(I
need
a
doctor,
doctor
To
bring
me
back
to
life)
It
literally
feels
like
a
lifetime
ago
But
I
still
remember
the
shit
like
it
was
just
yesterday
though
You
walked
in,
yellow
jump
suit
Whole
room,
cracked
jokes
Once
you
got
inside
the
booth,
told
you,
like
smoke
Went
through
friends,
some
of
them
I
put
on
But
they
just
left,
they
said
they
was
riding
to
the
death
But
where
the
fuck
are
they
now
Now
that
I
need
them,
I
don't
see
none
of
them
All
I
see
is
Slim
Fuck
all
you
fair-weather
friends
All
I
need
is
him
Fucking
backstabbers
When
the
chips
were
down
you
just
laughed
at
us
Now
you
bout
to
feel
the
fucking
wrath
of
aftermath,
faggots
You
gon
see
us
in
our
lab
jackets
and
ask
us
where
the
fuck

You
can
kiss
my
indecisive
ass
crack
maggots
and
the
crackers
ass
Little
crack
a
jack
beat
making
wack
math,
Backwards
producers,
I'm

bastards
One
more
CD
and
then
I'm
packing
up
my
bags
and
as
I'm
leaving
I'll
guarantee
they
scream
Dre
don't
leave
us
like
that
man
cause...
I'm
about
to
lose
my
mind
You've
been
gone
for
so
long
I'm
running
out
of
time
I
need
a
doctor
Call

To
bring
me
back

Ya

Hey

song
is
dedicated
to
the
memory
of
Erik
Schrody.
Rest
in
peace.
We'll
never
forget
about
you...fuckin
homo.
We'll
still
remember.
There
once
was
a
man
who
liked
to
jump
around.
(jump
around)
(yo)
But
he
got
too
old
to
jump
up
and
down.
(up
and
down)
(so

what
happened?)
So
he
put
the
mic
down
and
picked
a
guitar
up.
(picked
a
guitar
up)
(and
then
he

Started
singin
the
blues

Left
his
boys
in
the
house
of
pain.
(in

knack)
(hahahahaha)
And
I
remember
when
you
had
your
first
heart
attack.
(heart
attack)
(*wheezing
noise)
I
was
right

laughin'
when
i

(Yo
yo
yo
yo
yo
yo)
Remember
back
in
'94,
Like
right
before
Miss
Everlast
was
Whitey
Ford,
Before
his
heart
attack
had
him
on
life
support.
(beep
beep)
When
house
of
pain
was
out
of
fame,
Like
someone
doused
the
flame,
And
they
became
destined
To
never
jump
around
again.
Or
even
further
back,
When
I
first
had
heard
the
knack,
When
you
were
down
with
syndicate.
I
went
to
get
the
shit,
Man
I
was
into
it.
But
then
you
went,
and
took
your
style,
and
switched
the
shit.
Now
you
sound
ridiculous.
You
dickless
piece
of
shit.
How
could
you
diss
me
bitch?
(huh?)
I
liked
you.
Thought
you
was
alright
for
a
white
dude.
Remember
Sway
and
Tech
when
I
came
up
and
sat
beside
you,
Started
rhymin'
then
you
left
the
room
and
didnt
say
goodbye
or
nuthin.
Like
you
mad
that
someone
else
was
white
and
tryin'
ta
rhyme
or
somethin'.
I'm
sorry
man,
I
wasn't
tryin
ta
steal
your
light
or
nuthin.
But
your
a
homosexual,
white
rappin'
Irish
(unknown)
Man
I
wish
I
was
Irish,
I
could
be
a
(unknown)
too.
Then
I'd
be
confused
as
you,
And
I
wouldn't
know
what
to
do.
What's
up
witchu?
I
never
fucked
witchu,
Why
would
you
fuck
with
me?
Knowin'
I
could
rap
circles
around
you,
What?
Is
you
nuts
as
me?
Plus
I
can
sing
better
than
you,
And
I
don't
fuckin'
sing.
And
probably
play
guitar
better,
And
I
aint
never
touched
a
string.
But
I
aint
mad
at
you.
I'd
hate
me
too
if
I
was
you.
I'm
what
you
used
to
be.
Shit
you
was
me
in
'92.
So
every
time
I
write
a
lyric,
I'ma
think
of
you.
And
maybe
that'll
help
me
know
what
it's
like
to
sing
the
blues.
(ladi
da)
Cuz
I
remember
all
those
years.
How
it
was
when
you
were
here.
(I
know)
I

(how

How
it
was
when
you
were

Pop

Tryin

Hand

Second

My

someone
whered

Whose
it
belong
to
maybe
the
girl
with
the
long
blonde
hair
Who
disappeared
and
left
the
cheer
leader
pom

Clearly

wrong
cause
she
didn't
come
home
She's
missing
where

she
something
is
going
on
I
guess
he
stuck
the
bitch
with
the

fork
with
the
long
prongs
Now
everybody
get
your
dance

my
dance
song
[Dr.
Dre]
Check
Check,
1,2
,
1,2
1,2(it's
rolling)
Yea
yea
yea
Dr.
Dre
up
in
here
Y'all
know
what
this
is.
Its
what
y'all
been
waiting
for
Funk
Master
Flex,
Big
Kap,
Def
Jam
Records
giving
it
to
you
baby.
Yo
Eminem
show
these
mother
fuckers
what
time
it
is
baby
[Eminem]
I
used
to
be
a
lonely
man,
only
mad,
until
I
got
a
million
dollars,
shit
Now
if
i
only
had
some
fucking
hair
I'd
pull
it,
faster
than
a
bullet
Out
of
Tupac's
chest
before
the
ambulance
came
too
late
to
do
it
I'm
trying
to
grow
it
back
again,
it
was
an
accident
I
had
my
back
against
the
fan
and
chopped
it
off
in
Amsterdam
I
hate
the
straight
jacket
it
aint
latching,
and
can't
lock
it
So
they
stapled
my
hand
to
my
pants
pockets
The
cell's
padded
and
battered
like
someone
else
had
it
Before
me,
and
just
kept
throwing
they
fucking
selfs
at
it
My
head
is
aching,
I'm
dedicated
to
medication
But
this
med
is
taking
to
long
to
bring
me
this
sedadation?
(Come
on!)
Anyway
I
got
down
with
Dre
(What
up?)
The
first
man
who
taught
me
how
the
glock
sounded
to
spray
Running
up
and
down
the
street
screaming,
"Fuck
the
Police"
When
you
still
had
your
mother's
fucking
Nipple
stuck
in
your
teeth
(Fucking
baby)
Became
a
role
model
after
Colorado
Now
all
they
do
is
follow
me
around
and
holla
Bravo!
Hell
yea
I
punch
my
bitch
and
beat
my
kids
in
public
Suck
my
dick,
bitch
I'm
sick
enough
to
fuck
a
man
in
his
face
but
I
won't
Cause
you'll
probably
wanna
stand
in
his
place
So
put
a
sock
in
it,
with
your
fake-ass
Tupac
image
You
faggots
ain't
tough,
you
just
get
drunk
and
become
talkative
(Wanna
Fight?)
I'm
probably
the
akwardest
alcoholic
talking
Walking
like
a
midget
with
a
ladder
in
his
back
pocket
So
when
you
see
me
on
your
block
stumbling,
mumbling
A
bunch
of
dumb
shit
like
my
drunk
uncle
does
I
ain't
buzzed,
I'mm
juss
high
on
life
So
why
on
earth
would
I
need
drugs,
when
I
can
fly
on
kites?

The
whole
entire
world
can
sit
and
twirl
like
a
whirling
tire
I
set
a
fucking
girl
on
fire
with
a
curling
iron
(AHH!)
Psych
I'm
just
joking,
for
christ
sake
Dont
get
so
bent
out
of
shape
Cause
I
went
out
and
raped
six
girlfriends
Some
people
just
don't
get
it,
but
I
won't
let
it
upset
me
Cause
they
don't
know
better
They
don't
know
what
the
fuck
its
like
to
be
so
fed
up
And
fed
so
many
uppers
you're
down
and
won't
get
up
My
mind's
got
a
mind
of
it's
own,
sometimes
I
can't
find
it
at
home
It
hides
in
the
stove
(Hello,
where
you
at?)
Shit,
talk
about
your
brain
being
baked
My
shit's
still
in
the
oven
on
480
De-Grades
Hailey
Jade,
daddy
loves
you
baby,
Don't
ever
tell
me
how
to
raise
my
daughter
fuck
you
lady
You
critics
wanna
criticize
but
couldnt
visualize
Individuals
lives
through
a
criminal's
eyes
The
neighborhood
that
I
grew
up
in
you
could
die
for
nothing
And
Dirty
Dozen
watches
over
me
so
try
some
dumb
shit
I'll
have
a
fucking
man
raped
with
a
band-aid
over
his
mouth
And
shove
his
head
in
the
fan
blade
Don't
ever
tell
me
what
I
can
and
what
I
can't
say
Or
change
cause
of
the
age
range
in
my
fan
base
Like
I
give
a
fuck
who's
buying
this
shit
Quit
fucking
buying
it,
I'm
tired
bitch,
I'm
dying
to
quit
Hip
Hop
is
universal
now,
it's
all
commercial
now
It's
like
a
circle
full
of
circus
clowns
up
in
the
circuit
now
But
now
the
Withe
kids
like
it,
so
they
tell
me
I
can
buy
it
But
as
soon
as
I
get
on
the
mic
it's
like
the
night
get
silent
Either
that
or
booed,
thats
why
I
keep
an
attitude
And
go
to
sleep
with
it
and
wake
up
with
it
every
afternoon
I'm
sick
of
being
judged,
fuck
it
let
me
see
a
judge
I'll
confess
to
every
murder
I
committed
since
3
years
old
[Eminem
And
Dr.

Cause
if
I
get
locked

Then
I
might

Fuck
that,
turn
that
shit
off
Let's
get
the
fuck
out
of
here
You
know
how
we
do
(echo)
Ah,
yeah
(It's
like
this,
like
this)
This
is
Eminem,
baby,
back
up
in
that
motherfucking
ass
('Til
forever,
'til
forever)
One
time
for
your
motherfuckin'
mind
(For
MC's,
MC's)
We
represent
the
313,
you
know
what
I'm
saying?
Yo,
they
don't
know
shit
about
this,
for
the
'96
Ayo,
my
pen
and
paper
cause
a
chain
reaction
To
get
your
brain
relaxin',
the
zany
actin'
maniac
in
action
A
brainiac
in
fact,
son,
you
mainly
lack
attraction
You
look
insanely
wack
when
just
a
fraction
of
my
tracks
run
My
rhymin'
skills
got
you
climbin'
hills
I
travel
through
your
mind,
and
chill
your
spine
like
siren
drills
I'm
slimin'
grills
of
roaches,
with
spray
that
disinfects
And
twistin'
necks
of
rappers
'Til
their
spinal
column
disconnects
Put
this
in
decks
and
check
the
monologue
Turn
your
system
up,
twist
'em
up
And
indulge
in
the
marijuana
smog
This
is
the
season
for
noise
pollution
contamination
Examination
of
more
car-tunes
than
animation
My
lamination
of
narration
Hits
a
snare
and
bass
on
a
track
for
duck
rapper
interrogation
When
I
declare
invasion
There
ain't
no
time
to
be
starin',
gazin'
I
turn
the
stage
into
a
barren
wasteland
I'm
Infinite;
you
heard
of
Hell
Well,
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it,
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
I'm
trying
to
repent
from
it
But
when
I
hear
the
beat,
I'm
tempted
To
make
another
attempt
at
it;
I'm
Infinite
Bust
it!
I
let
the
beat
commence
So
I
can
beat
the
sense
in
your
elite
defense
I
got
some
meat
to
mince
A
crew
to
stomp,
and
then
two
feet
to
rinse
I
greet
the
gents
and
ladies,
I
spoil
loyal
fans
I
foil
plans
and
leave
fluids
leaking
like
oil
pans
My
coiled
hands
around
this
microphone
are
lethal
One
thought
in
my
cerebral
is
deeper
than
a
jeep-full
of
people
MC's
are
feeble,
I
came
to
cause
some
pandemonium
Battle
a
band
of
phony
MC's,
and
stand
the
lonely
one
Imitator,
intimidator,
stimulator
Simulator
of
data
eliminator
There's
never
been
a
greater
since
the
burial
of
Jesus
Fuck
around
and
catch
all
the
venereal
diseases
My
thesis'll
smash
a
stereo
to
pieces
My
a
cappella
releases
classic
masterpieces
Through
telekinesis,
it
eases
you
mentally
Gently,
sentimentally,
instrumentally
With
entity,
dementedly
meant
to
be
Infinite
I'm
Infinite;
you
heard
of
Hell
Well,
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it,
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
I'm
trying
to
repent
from
it
But
when
I
hear
the
beat,
I'm
tempted
To
make
another
attempt
at
it;
I'm
Infinite
Man,
I
got
evidence,
I'm
never
dense
And
I've
been
clever
ever
since
my
residence
was
hesitant
To
do
some
shit
that
represents
the
MO
So
I'm
assuming
all
responsibility
Cause
there's
a
monster
will
in
me
That
always
wants
to
kill
MCs
Mic
nestler,
slammin'
like
a
wrestler
Here
to
make
a
mess
of
a
lyric
smuggling
embezzler
No
one
is
specialer,
my
skill
is
intergalactical
I
get
cynical,
act
a
fool,
then
I
send
a
crew
back
to
school
I
never
packed
a
tool
or
acted
cool,
it
wasn't
practical
I'd
rather
let
a
tactical,
tactful
track
tickle
your
fancy
In
fact,
I
can't
see,
or
can't
imagine
A
man
who
ain't
a
lover
of
beats
or
a
fan
of
scratchin'
So
this
is
for
my
family,
the
kid
who
had
a
cameo
On
my
last
jam,
plus
the
man
who
never
had
a
plan
B
Be
all
you
can
be,
cause
once
you
make
an
instant
hit
I'm
tensed
a
bit,
and
tempted
When
I
see
the
sins
my
friends
commit
I'm
Infinite;
you
heard
of
Hell
Well,
I
was
sent
from
it
I
went
to
it,
serving
a
sentence
For
murdering
instruments
Now
I'm
trying
to
repent
from
it
But
when
I
hear
the
beat,
I'm
tempted
To
make
another
attempt
at
it;
I'm
Infinite
'95,
'96
('96)
And
on
and
on
and
on
(and
on
and
on)
"So
let's
get
down
to
business
I
don't
got
no
time
to
play
around,
what
is
this?"
{*scratching*}
What
is
this?
what
is
this?
[Intro]
The
Invasion!
(Invasion
yeah)
Green
Lantern!
the
infiltration,
we
comin'!
(yeah)
[Bridge:
Eminem]
I
got
50
Cent,
I
got
G-Unit
D-Tweezy
in
this
bitch,
wit
Obie
Trice!
So
watch
what
you
say,
'fore
you
call
our
name
Cause
you
say
one
more
thing
and
it
won't
be
nice!
[Verse:
Eminem]
Whoa,
here
we
go,
I
shoulda'
known
I
was
bound
to
get
pulled
into
some
bullshit
Sooner
or
later
you
little
haters
Are
too
jealous
of
us
to
love
us
You
hate
it
G-Unit
made
it
and
Obie's
coming
D-Tweezy's
coming
you're
sick
to
your
stomach
50
percent
of
it's
50
cent
The
other
50
percent
of
it's
who's
color
of
skin
it
is
But
if
you
even
considerin'
taking
our
label
down
You
better
find
our
building
and
fly
a
fucking
plane
into
it
But
I
ain't
trying
to
get
too
intricate
into
it
I'm
just
trying
to
you
give
you
a
little
hint
for
your
own
benefit
Cause
then
it's
gonna
get
to
the
point
Where
it
escalates
to
some
other
shit
Then
I'm
a
flip,
then
I'm
a
get
to
"Stomping
in
my
Air
Force
Ones"
But
you
won't
be
able
to
tell
If
it's
two
pairs
or
it's
one
It's
just
gonna
feel
like
so
many
feet
kicking
you
You'd
think
Nike
just
made
these
into
cleats
in
this
shoe
I
don't
know
what
it
is
or
what
it
could
be
But
I
get
a
woody
when
these
pussies
try
to
push
me
Thinking
they
gonna
put
me
in
a
position
to
pickle
me
Y'all
tickle
me
pink
I
think
I'd
just
rather
have
Pink
tickle
me
Hickory
dickory
dock,
tickety
tock
tickety
A
little
bit
of
the
diggedy
doc
diggedy
Mixed
with
a
little
bit
of
the
{*Eminem
vocal
scratch*}
Wit
a
pinch
of
Biggie
Look
at
me,
I'm
just
the
bomb
diggedy
[Chorus:
Eminem]
We
the
realest
label
Don't
try
to
act
like
you
don't
feel
our
label
Cause
we
gon'
fuck

Still

Cause
I'm

than
six
months

cocked*}
[Outro]
Haha,
Shady
Records
Still
Aftermath,
and
don't
think
we
don't
Hear
you
motherfuckers
talkin'!
Cause
we
do
and
we
see
y'all
We
just
gon'
sit
back
for
a
minute
While
I

Down

Down

Down

Down

Guess

Shady's
back,
tell
a
friend
Now
everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
To
the
dance
floor,
to
the
dance
floor
Now
everyone
report
to
the
dance
floor
Alright,
stop
pajama
time
Come
here,
little
kiddies!
On
my
lap!
Guess
who's
back
with
a
brand
new
rap?
And
I
don't
mean
"rap"
as
in
a
new
case
Of
child
molestation
accusations
Ah
ah
ah
ah
ah,
no
worries
Papa's
got
a
brand
new
bag
of
toys
What
else
could
I
possibly
do
to
make
noise?
I've
done
touched
on
everything
but
little
boys
That's
not
a
stab
at
Michael
That's
just
a
metaphor,
I'm
just
psycho
I
go
a
little
bit
crazy
sometimes
I
get
a
little
bit
out
of
control
with
my
rhymes
Good
God,
dip,
do
a
little
slide
Bend
down,
touch
your
toes,
and
just
glide
To
the
center
of
the
dance
floor
Like
TP
for
my
bung-hole
And
it's
cool
if
you
let
one
go
Nobody's
gonna
know,
who'd
hear
it?
Give
a
little
"poot
poot,"
it's
okay
*fart
sound*
Oops,
my
CD
just
skipped
And
everyone
just
heard
you
let
one
rip
Now
I'm
gonna
make
you
dance
It's
your
chance,
yeah
boy,
shake
that
ass
Whoops,
I
mean
girl
girl,
girl,
girl
Girl,
you
know
you're
my
world
Alright,
now
lose
it!
(ah
ah
ah
ah
ah)
Just
lose
it!
(ah
ah
ah
ah
ah)
Go
crazy!
(ah
ah
ah
ah
ah)
Oh,
baby
(ah
ah)
oh,
baby,
baby
(ah
ah)
It's
Friday
and
it's
my
day
Just
to
party
all
the
way
to
Sunday
Maybe
'til
Monday,
I
don't
know
what
day
Everyday's
just
a
holiday
Cruisin'
on
the
freeway,
feelin'
kind
of
breezy
Let
the
top
down
and
my
hair
blow
I
don't
know
where
I'm
goin',
all
I
know
is
When
I
get
there
someone's
gonna
(touch
my
body)
Excuse
me,
miss,
I
don't
mean
to
sound
like
a
jerk
But
I'm

Spit

They

"Save

Yellin'

(Touch

Now
this
is
the
part
where
the
rap
breaks
down
It
gets
real
intense,
no
one
makes
a
sound
Everything
looks
like
it's
8
Mile
now
The
beat
comes
back
and
everybody
lose
themselves
Now
snap
back
to
reality;
look,

When

tries
And

I

a

mental
illness

Get

The
rhyme

And

Yo

Hi...Hi....
My

Slim
Shady...Slim
Shady...Bitch
you're
little
just
like
that
Kim
lady
And
I'm
in
sky
rock
radio...the
shadiest
bro
on
the
radio
But
you
dont
hear
me
tho.....
"I’ve
always
looked
at
battle
rap
as
competition
or
war,
and
the
main
objective
is
to
destroy,
completely
fuckin'
obliterate
your
opponent
by
saying
anything
and
everything,
whatever
the
fuck
you
can,
to
get
a
reaction
from
the
crowd.
So
nothing's
off
limits."
I
need
you
to
spit
that
lyrical
miracle…
in
the
swimming
pool
Before
this
kicks
off,
let
me
set
my
balls
in
this
tees
’Cause
I'm
dottin'
i's
every
time
I
cross
one
of
these
There's
not
a
redeeming
quality
at
all
in
me
It's
impossible,
seems
like
an
implausible
dream
Positive
clean
thoughts
intervene
But
they're
all
either
altered
and
mean
Assault
and
demean,
tossed
and
they're
being
lost
in
the
scheme
Squashed
in-between
a
brainwashing
machine
Like
an
Islamic
regime,
a
jihadist
extreme
radical
Suicide
bomber
that’s
seeing
Ariana
Grande
sing
her
last
song
of
the
evening
And
as
the
audience
from
the
damn
concert
is
leaving
Detonates
the
device
strapped
to
his
abdominal
region
I’m
not
gonna
finish
that,
for
obvious
reasons
But
bring
your
dogs,
I'ma
muzzle
’em
I'm
not
Middle
Eastern
but
I'll
make
a
bitch
Raqqa
hijab
And
at
least
a
extra
large
in
the
T-shirt
Headscarf
and
a
piece
of
tarp
underneath
the
carpet,
hasta
la
vista
I
go
Hamas
on
the
beats
to
a
paradox
on
the
beach
And
a
pair
of
crotchless
underwear
on
a
terrorist
watch
list
Gettin'
head
in
the
sand
like
an
embarrassed
ostrich
Professional
shit
sprayer
Bitch
watch
who
you
talkin’
to,
like
Apple
wristwear
Endangered
species
in
this
ABC
shit
a
bit
scarce
Prey's
decreasing,
I
face
extinction
like
disc
players
Told
this
chick
she's
hot
as
Jada
Pinkett
And
just
stared
'til
I
made
her
think
it
Said,
"Maybe
we
should
just
get
married."
She's
facing
me,
I
placed
my
feet
with
my
hips
square
Tell
her,
"Turn
around,"
spread
her
legs
for
me,
then
I
hit
bare
Leave
her
stretched
out
like
a
baby
T-shirt
on
Ric
Flair
As
I
ripped
her,
anal
beads
in
a
split
rear
Spray
Febreze
in
the
chick's
hair
Make
her
wheeze
tryna
get
air
I
played
for
keeps,
there's
no
escaping
me,
I
have
a
bitch
scared
And
chained
to
me,
and
throw
away
the
key
And
she'll
be
so
afraid
to
leave
That
even
if
she
ends
up
breaking
free
she'll
just
sit
there
Tryin'
to
scrape
up
enough
courage
and
strength
to
get
up
It's
impossible
like
rapin'
a
slut
We
stay
butt-naked
and
fuck
You're
close,
wait
for
you,
what?
My
idea,
you
comin'
too,
it's
waking
you
up
With
smelling
salts
after
I
Quaalude
your
cup
That'll
straighten
you
up
if
you
try
to
stray
like
a
pup
Hate
to
get
bogged
down
in
details
But
bitch,
I'm
like
the
dog
pound
with
females
My
brain
is
corrupt,
real
life,
Hillside
Strangler
I
strangle
a
skank's
neck
'til
it's
triangular
Shape
but
it's
upside
down,
and
my
mouth
ain't
gonna
shut
And
mention
me
in
your
raps
if
it
makes
you
a
buck
Or
helps
you
rake
in
the
duckets,
I
want
payment
in
pub
'Cause
I
ain't
tryna
get
in
your
bars
like
I'm
waiting
the
club
But
if
you
put
me
in
your
lines,
I'm
takin'
a
cut
Get
a
million
writers
inside
of
a
room
combined
in
it
Try
to
get
every
idea
of
every
possible
line
to
spit
Every
punchline,
every
combination
that
rhymes
with
it
Bitch,
a
whole
team
can't
see
me,
there's
no
I's
in
it
Head
so
big,
I
shot
myself
ten
times
in
it
Tryna
commit
suicide
in
it,
took
five
minutes
And
I
survived
this
shit
Someone's
gonna
challenge
me,
who?
Battle
me
and
win,
that's
a
fucking
fallacy
too
You
name
one
motherfucker
in
this
galaxy,
*spits*,
reality
You
fantasy,
rally
your
troops,
try
to
boost
the
morale
Only
time
I
start
a
movement's
a
bowel
I
can't
even
give
a
"yeah"
or
a
"woo"
when
you
rap
in
the
booth
Not
even
a
"nah"
or
a
"boo"
'Cause
even
though
I'm
allergic
to
the
crap
that
you
spew
When
I'm
'bout
to
break
out,
I
don't
mean
get
a
rash
from
it
too
'Cause
when
I
say
I
have
allergies,
I
actually
do
But
that's
just
an
analogy,
I've
never
had
a
reaction
to
you
Creature
from
the
Black
Lagoon
I
reach
up
and
I
smack
the
moon
You're
grief
struck
that
I'm
back
so
soon
Your
teacher
for
this
afternoon
Creep
up
with
a
pack
of
hoodlums
We
pack
a
punch
like
Capri
Sun
Heat
tucked
like
we
each
snuck
in
a
submachine
gun
We
stuck
in
a
submarine
bun,
with
a
bag
of
shrooms
Cup
of
lean
up
in
the
padded
room
Justin
Bieber
in
a
Catholic
school
Selling
dust
and
reefer
when
your
back
is
to
him
Don't
adjust
your
speaker
I'll
cuss
the
stripes
off
of
a
fuckin'
zebra
when
I'm
at
the
zoo
Huffin'
cleaner
'til
I
gag
from
fumes
Fuck
Christina
with
a
plastic
spoon
While
I
bump
some
G-Funk
and
blast
some
Snoop
'Cause
her
double
g-cups
are
massive,
huge!
It's
fun
for
me
just
to
grab
a
boob
Plus
my
penis
got
an
attitude
My
fuckin'
Weiner's
in
a
combative
mood
Come
and
suck
a
mean
one
like
it's
mad
at
you
I
speak
tongue-in-cheek,
what
you
asslicks
do
'Cause
you
love
to
eat
butt,
it's
sad
but
true
I
just
sprung
a
leak
suddenly
What
I
think
in
my
gut
instinct
become
in
sync
My
thoughts
and
my
stomach
link
up
with
each
other
Ink
touches
the
pad,
then
boom!
Since
the
day
Dre
gave
me
beats,
I
was
made
elite
That's
basically
what
makes
me
me
Creating
stink,
'til
these
tats
are
fading
ink
Who's
the
greatest?
Think
we're
still
debating,
wink
ADD,
and
better
put
out
an
APB
'Cause
it'll
take
LAPD
and
me
layin'
in
the
street
For
you
to
see
Shady
beat
And
I'll
bet
ya
they'd
need
cleats
'Cause
I'd
have
to
be
stomped
by
forty
men
to
suffer
a
defeat
I
pray
please
Jesus
to
make
me
decent
Inhaling
the
main
ingredient
of
pain
relievers,
and
saline
I
take
three
Aleves,
tryna
break
these
fevers,
I'm
ailing
I
stay
free
of
divas
and
ladies
screamin'
'Cause
they
keep
schemin'
on
me
Vading
keepin'
the
women
at
bay
Like
Laci
Peterson,
baby
fetuses
Legs
and
feet
have
been
weighted,
chained
in
semen
It's
straight
demon—and
wait!
Even
if
it
takes
meat
cleavers
to
make
believers
Mistake-free
schemes
are
enablin'
me
to
remain
deviant
Breakbeat,
eat
her
like
steak
meat
Emcees
take
seats
like
AMC
theaters
Deranged
ringleader,
depraved
king
Who
mainstream
media
hates
Which
makes
things
easier,
still
under
scrutiny
Villainous
smooth
criminal,
livin'
room
With
the
nude
Reese
Witherspoon
Who
was
bruised,
beat
with
a
broom
It's
in
two
pieces,
and
lays
deceased
in
it
Bit
with
a
chewed
leash,
and
his
chain-link
leapin'
it
Live
in
the
booth,
shave,
eat,
bathe,
drink,
sleep
in
it
R-A-P
bleed
the
shit,
still
and
I
poop,
pee
it
It's
a
spillage,
a
sewage
leak,
waste
deep
feces
The
syllables
ooze
fecal,
they
feel
like
renewed
leases
'Cause
my
brain
releases
'em
Like
waste
excretion,
it's
simultaneously
As
I'm
givin'
these
fools
grief,
they're
feelin'
the
blues
'Cause
even
if
stealin'
my
shoes,
thieves
Just
to
fill
'em's
a
huge
feat
A
hill
and
it's
too
steep
Obey
these
demons,
we're
still
in
cahoots
Keep
feedin'
me
blank
sheets
As
soon
as
I
sink
these
teeth
And
I'm
killin'
the
loose
leaf
Time
to
shake
these
trees
again
Wait,
make
that
phrase
repeat
again
Killin'
the
loose
leaf,
shake
these
trees
again
Get
the
rake,
but
it
ain't
me
leavin'
'em
Vicodins,
new
prints,
I
bite
them
and
chew
them
The
whites
and
the
blues
mixed
with
nitrus
balloons
And
I
like
to
sniff
gluesticks,
put
Ricin
on
toothpicks
On
the
mic
I'm
just
ruthless,
a
crisis,
a
nuisance
Who
I
influence
I
give
two
shits
If
they
wanna
license
my
music
to
entice
with
Then
use
the
shit
like
it's
the
blueprint
for
ISIS
recruitment
Excuse
me
while
I
stare
into
space
for
a
few
In
a
daze
or
haze,
glazed
over,
crazed
warp
loon
Mental
cased
off,
always
had
a
straight-forward
view
But
you
bozos
keep
givin'
the
flamethrower
fuel
No
one's
ever
sank
lower,
shrewd,
and
way
more
rude
Beast-mode
like
a
lawn-mower
blade
rolled
thru
it
And
this
has
little
to
do
with
bein'
gay,
boy
It's
just
where
the
wordplay's
goin'
But
ain't
much
I
can
say
or
do
'Cause
ain't
no
excuse,
the
way
I
go
at
you
faggot
You
say
I'm
always
screw-faced
So
if
I
look
your
way,
you're
screwed
'Cause
if
looks
could
kill,
I
could
start
a
hate-war
too
'Cause
I'd
murder
you
straight
bitches
by
turnin'
the
gaze
on
you
Let's
take
it
back
before
the
tightly-worn
pants
To
the
Nike,
Jordan,
hats
The
stripe
Lee's,
Jordache,
and
the
white
tees
Lightning
storms
might
be
formed
fast
Such
a
frightening
forecast!
But
when
you're
slightly
hoarse,
rasp
From
the
cyphering
or-gasp,
but
still
reciting
your
raps
While
you're
tightening
your
grasp
around
the
mic
'cause
you
done
shitted
on
it
so
much,
you're
always
reminded
of
your
past
'Cause
your
heiny's
sore,
that's
'Cause
you
still
haven't
finished
fuckin'
wiping
your
ass
From
the
night
before
last
No
good,
but
rap
somethin'
I'm
too-good-for-my-own-good
at
Fuck
adulthood,
I'm
a
grown-up
brat
Where
your
cojones
at?
Mine
are
always
being
rode,
in
fact:
They're
frozen,
you
ever
seen
a
cul-de-sac?
So
big
they
fell
out
my
scrotum,
I
just
sowed
'em
back
Dick
so
long,
need
a
shoulder-strap
For
that,
gotta
unroll
it
and
fold
it
back
So
difficult
to
wrap
in
the
pro-filactic,
it
overlaps
it
So
I
pack
a
Trojan
so
fat,
when
I
lay
it
flat
it's
like
a
yoga
mat
Make
a
bitch
think
she's
in
aerobics
class
The
bear
you
don't
wanna
poke
its
back
The
backbone
of
rap,
your
fuckin'
lead
singles
are
my
bonus
tracks
When
I
appear,
my
peers
stop
Hearts
fall
in
their
stomach,
their
spirits
drop
Careers
flop,
their
gears
lock,
severe
shock
Fear
at
the
mere
thought
Lyrics
are
top-tier,
I'm
so
high
at
the
top
I'm
in
the
sky
when
I
talk
Bitch,
I'm
so
fly
when
I
walk,
my
ears
pop
Oh,
and
I'm
just
playin'
ladies,
you
know
I
love
you

a
idea

Girl,

a
symptom
Of
a
simp
'cause

spent
some
new
to
get
some
Ask

I'm

Kim
Jong-Un,
a
pimp
son
Swag

I'm

a
pub
Went

Ended

She

She's

Then

stripper
Now

vow
(Vow)
it
out
(Out)
Rap
circles
around
('Round),
surround
sound
(Sound)
John
Rambo's
back
and
my
ammo
stacked
And
I'm
cocking
rap,
some
on
your
head
Other
words,
I'm
stocking
caps
and
I'm
talking
facts
Like
office
max
Never
down,
I'll
be
up
like
an
insomniac
Girl,
I
got
racks
you
gotta
rack
How
you
got
all
that
back
and
no
body
fat
I'm
in
awe
with
that
When
I
stop
the
Pontiac
at
the
laundry
mat
that
I
saw
you
at
You
almost
had
a
heart
attack
when
you
met
Cardiac
You
ran
inside,
told
your
boyfriend
like,
"I'll
be
back"
But
for
all
you
know
I
probably
act
like
I'm
Daniel
Wozniak
I'm
a
psycho-chopathic
killer
I'm
a
capular
caterpillar
With
the
botanic
of
bananas
you
ain't
never
heard
better
vernacular
comin
after
your
scapular
For
the
lack
of
a
better
word
Dracula
'Cause
I'm
attackin'
a
rapper
in
the
phrenic
nerve
I'm
a
savage
back,
put
the
dagger
in
the
back
of
competitors
Predator
and
scavenger
I
am
a
carnivore
in
a
ball,
at
the
dollar
store
What
the
fuck
you
got
a
wallet
for?
Y'all
are
poor
I
was
livin'
in
squalor
but

Fuckin'

Alright

beard
We

Your

mic?
Rihanna
just
hit
me
on
the
text
Last
night
I
left
hickeys
on
her
neck
Wait,
you
just
dissed
me,
I'm
perplexed
Insult
me
in
a
line,
compliment
me
on
the
next,
damn
I'm
really
sorry
you
want
me
to
have
a
heart
attack
Was
watchin'
8
Mile
on
my
Nordic
Track
Realized
I
forgot
to
call
you
back
Here's
that
autograph
for
your
daughter,
I
wrote
it
on
a
Starter
cap
Stan,
Stan,
son,
listen,
man,
dad
isn't
mad
But
how
you
gonna
name
yourself
after
a
damn
gun
and
have
a
man
bun?
The
giant's
woke,
eyes
open,
undeniable
Supplyin'
smoke,
got
the
fire
stoked
Say
you
got
me
in
a
scope,
but
you
grazed
me
I
say
one
call
to
Interscope
and
you're
Swayze
Your
reply
got
the
crowd
yelling,
"Woo"
So
before
you
die
let's
see
who
can
out-petty
who
With
your
corny
rhymes
(Slim
you're
old)
Ow,
Kelly,
ooh,
but
I'm
45
and
I'm
still
outselling
you
By
29
I
had
three
albums
that
had
blew
Now
let's
talk
about
somethin'
I
don't
really
do
Go
in
someone's
daughter's
mouth
stealin'
food
But
you're
a
fuckin'
mole
hill,
now
I'ma
make
a
mountain
out
of
you,
woo!
Ho,
chill,
actin'
like
you
put
the
chrome
barrel
to
my
bone
marrow
Gun,
I
bet
you
ain't
a
bow
and
arrow
Say
you'll
run
up
on
me
like
a
phone
bill,
sprayin'
lead
Playin'
dead,
that's
the
only
time
you
hold
still
Are
you
eating
cereal...
or
oatmeal?
What
the
fuck's
in
the
bowl,
milk?
Wheaties
or
Cheerios?
'Cause
I'm
takin'
a
shit
in
'em,
Kelly,

Yo

Luxury,

To

front

Younger

whack

It's
funny,
but

I'd

80
year
old
me
than
20
year
old

'Til
I'm
getting
old-aged

fill
a
whole

10
year
old's
rage
Got

Labor
Day

Bein'

In

B
for
the
effort,
but
if
I
was
three
Foot
11,
you'd
look
up
to
me,
and
for
the
record
You
would
suck
a
dick
to
fuckin'
be
me
for
a
second
Lick
a
ballsack
to
get
on
my
channel
Give
your
life
to
be
this
solidified
This
mothafuckin'
shit
is
like
Rambo
when
he's
out
of
bullets
So
what
fuckin'
good
is
a
machine
gun
when
it's
out
of
ammo?
Had
enough
of
this
tatted-up
mumble
rapper
How
the
fuck
can
him
and
I
battle?
He'll
have
to
fuck
Kim
in
my
flannel
I'll
give
him
my
sandals
'Cause
he
knows
long
as
I'm
Shady,
he's
gon'
have
to
live
in
my
shadow
Exhausting,
letting
off
on
my
offspring
Like
a
gun
barrel,
bitch,
get
off
me
You
dance
around
it
like
a
sombrero,
we
can
all
see
You're
fucking
salty
'cause
young
Gerald's
balls-deep
inside
of
Halsey
Your
red
sweater,
your
black
leather
You
dress
better,
I
rap
better
That
a
death
threat
or
a
love
letter?
Little
white
toothpick
Thinks
it's
over
a
pic,
I
just
don't
like
you,
prick
Thanks
for
dissing
me
Now
I
had
an
excuse
on
the
mic
to
write
"Not
Alike"
But
really,
I
don't
care
who's
in
the
right
But
you're
losin'
the
fight
you
picked
Who
else
want
it,
Kells?
Attempt
fails,
button,
L's
Fuckin'
nails
in
these
coffins
as
soft
as
Cottonelle
Killshot,
I
will
not
fail,
I'm
with
the
Doc
still
But
this
idiot's
boss
pops
pills
and
tells
him
he's
got
skills
But
Kells,
the
day
you
put
out
a
hit's
the
day
Diddy
admits
That
he
put
the
hit
out
that
got
Pac
killed,
ah
I'm
sick
of
you
bein'
whack
And
still
usin'
that
mothafuckin'
AutoTune,
so
let's
talk
about
it
(let's
talk
about
it)
I'm
sick
of
your
mumble
rap
mouth
Need
to
get
the
cock
up
out
it
before
we
can
even
talk
about
it
(talk
about
it)
I'm
sick
of
your
blonde
hair
and
earrings
Just
'cause
you
look
in
the
mirror
and
think
you're
Marshall
Mathers
(Marshall
Mathers)
Don't
mean
you
are,
and
you're
not
about
it
So
just
leave
my
dick
in
your
mouth,
and
leave
my
daughter
out
it
You
fuckin'...
oh
And
I'm
just
playin',
Diddy,
you
know
I
love
you
Here
to
stay
Even
when
I'm
gone
When
I
close
my
eyes
Through
the
passage
of
time
Kings
never
die
I
can
hear
the
drummers
drumming
And
the
trumpets,
someone's
tryna
summon
someone,
I
know
something's
coming
But
I'm
running
from
it
to
be
standing
at
the
summit
And
plummet,
how
come
it
wasn't
what
I
thought
it
was
Was
it,
too
good
to
be
true?
Have
nothing,
get
it
all
but
too
much
of
it
Then
lose
it
again,
then
I
swallow
hallucinogens
Cause
if
not,
where
the
hell
did
it
go?
Cause
here
I
sit
in
Lucifer's
den
by
the
dutch
oven
Just
choosing
to
sin
Even
if
it
means
I'm
selling
my
soul,
just
to
be
the
undisputed
again
Do
whatever
I
gotta
do
this
to
win
Cause
I
got
this
motherfucking
cloud
over
my
head
Crown
around
it,
thorns
on
it
Cracks
in
it,
bet
you
morons
didn't
Think
I'd
be
back,
did
ya?
How
'bout
that
I'm
somehow
now
back
to
the
underdog
But
no
matter
how
loud
that
I
bark,
this
sport
is
something
I
never
bow-wow'd
at
I
complain
about
the
game,
I
shout
and
I
pout,
it's
a
love-hate
But
I
found
out
that
I
can
move
a
mountain
of
doubt
Even
when
you
bitches
are
counting
me
out,
and
I
appear
to
be
down
for
the
count
Only
time
I
ever
been
out
and
about
is
driving
around
town
with
my
fucking
whereabouts,
in
a
doubt
cause
I
been
lost
tryna
think
of
what
I
did
to
get
here
but
I'm
not
a
quitter
Gotta
get
up,
give
it
all
I
got
or
give
up
Spit
or
shit
or
stepped
on
but
kept
going
I'm
tryna
be
headstrong
but
it
feels
like
I
slept
on
my
neck
wrong
Cause
you're
moving
onto
the
next,
but
is
the
respect
gone?
Cause
someone
told
me
that
(Kings
never
die)
Don't
give
me
that
sob
story
liar,
don't
preach
to
the
choir
You
ain't
ever
have
to
reach
in
the
fire
to
dig
deep
Nobody
ever
handed
me
shit
in
life,
not
even
a
flyer
Wouldn't
even
take
shit
into
consideration
Obliterate
anyone
in
the
way
I
think
I
see
why
a
lot
of
rappers
get
on
these
features
and
try
to
show
out
on
a
track
with
me
But
it'd
actually
have
to
be
a
fucking
blowout
to
get
me
to
retire
Tell
these
new
artists
that
kings
never
die
I
know
shit
has
changed
in
this
age,
fuck
a
Twitter
page,
did
just
say
I've
been
upstaged?
Why
am
I
online?
It's
driving
me
crazy,
I'm
riding
shotgun
tryna
get
a
gauge
Almost
hot,
but
I'm
not
running
kaboom,
with
a
stage
pass
and
this
shit
And
opinions
sway,
I
can
hear
them
say,
if
I
stay
passionate
maybe
I
can
stay
Jay
miraculous
Comeback
as
if
I
went
away,
but
detractors
just
say
some
bullshit
for
the
Renegade
Someone's
gonna
make
me
blow
my
composure
Here
I
go
again,
to
the
stage
and
I
feel
like
I'm
in
a
cage
They
so
want
a
champion
to
fall
I
still
wonder
why
I
laugh
at
'em
cause
why
carry
when
I'm
all
So
fuck
what
these
cynics
say
Just
goes
to
show
that
when
my
back's
against
the
wall
And
I'm
under
attack
again,
I'll
act
as
if
I'm
posted
up
With
this
pented
rage
cause
saw
all
these
plaques
in
my
office
On
the
floor
stacked
against
the
door
All
be
just
metaphors
for
the
odds
of
When
you
comin'
back
again
cause
all
the
accomplishments,
accolades,
awards
And
trophies
just
don't
mean
jack
anymore
Cause
I'm
here
today
and
gone
tomorrow
And
I'm
not
gonna
be
Here
to
stay
Even
when
I'm
gone
When
I
close
my
eyes
Through
the
passage
of
time
Kings
never
die
I
want
it,
I'm
coming
to
get
it,
so
you
son
of
a
bitches
don't
duck
your
gun
and
get
rid
of
those
Critics
all
end
up
in
critical,
think
your
shit
is
dope
all
you're
gonna
get
is
smoked
then
And
I'm
not
stopping
until
I'm
top
again,
all
alone
and
on
a
throne
Like
a
token
of
respect,
or
a
homage
poem,
or
an
ode,
I've
been
on
Tossed
in
the
air
by
my
own
arm,
and
launched
so
hard
I
broke
my
collarbone
And
it's
my
time
to
go,
but
I'm
still
not
leaving
Stop
for
no
one,
I
don't
know
but
I've
been
told
that
I
should
go
Launch
a
Rover,
knock
it
over,
time
to
go
for
that
pot
of
gold,
cause
They
say
kings
never
die
Just
ask
Jam
Master
Jay
They
just
grow
wings
and
they
fly
So,
hands
up,
reach
for
the
sky
Try
to
hold
up
and
provoke
these
moments
Cause
in
a
blink
of
an
eye
They'll
be
over
Tryna
secure
your
legacy
like
Shakur
And
ensure
that
nobody's
ever
gonna
be
what
you
were
So
before
you're
leaving
this
Earth
You
want
people
to
feel
the
fury
of
a
pure
evil
cerebral
berzerk
Deacon
of
words,
syllable
genius
at
work
Plus
I'm
think
that
they're
mistaking
my
kindness
for
weakness,
distill
it
with
meanness
With
some
kind
of
back
flipping
burgers
on
the
grill
for
some
peanuts
Secure
us
to
arenas,
call
me
Gilbert
Arenas,
still
appeal
to
the
dreamers
I
made
it
to
the
silverscreen
where
Rocky
stepped
with
the
demons
Khalil
on
the
beat
cause
making
the
beat
ain't
the
same
feeling
to
me
is
killing
the
beat
It's
fulfilling
to
me,
what
filling
a
seat
is
That
sound,
vomit,
thirst
and
how
common
underground
commons
eat
Outsider
stomach
growl,
throbbing
hunger
Out-rhyming
everyone,
God
just
give
me
one
shot
I
swear
that
I
won't
let
you
down
I'mma
be
around
forever,
entertain
even
in
the
ground
You
ain't
ever
gonna
hear
me
say
I
ain't
Here
to
stay
Even
when
I'm
gone
When
I
close
my
eyes
Through
the
passage
of
time
Kings
never
die
Oh,
oh,
oh
Oh,
oh,
oh
Kings

While

Do

And
my

none,
because
I'm

I

I'm

I

I
wanna
hold

hold

(Right
we
wanna

alcohol,
we
wanna
love

wanna
love

I

There's
a
certain
mystique
when
I
speak,
that
you
notice
'Cause
it's
sort
of
unique
'cause
you
know
it's
me
My
poetry's
deep,
and
I'm
stillmatic,
the
way
I
flow
to
this
beat
You
can't
sit
still,
it's
like
trying
to
smoke
crack
and
go
to
sleep
I'm
strapped,
it's
known
any
minute
I
could
snap
I'm
the
equivalent
of
what
would
happen
if
Bush
rapped
I
bully
these
rappers
so
bad
lyrically
It
ain't
even
funny,
I
ain't
even
hungry,
it
ain't
even
money
You
can't
pay
me
enough
for
you
to
play
me
It's
cockamamey
you
just
ain't
zany
enough
to
rock
with
Shady
My
noodle
is
cock-a-doodle,
my
clock's
coo-coo
I
got
screws
loose,
yea
the
whole
kitten
caboodle,
I'm
just
brutal
It's
no
rumor,
I'm
numero
uno,
assume
it
There's
no
more
humor
in
it,
you
know
I'm
rolling
with
a
swollen
bowling
ball
in
my
bag
You
need
a
fag
and
tear
a
near
hole
in
my
ass,
you
better
love
me,
bitch
[Chorus]
[50
Cent]
And
all
the
bitches
say
My
buzz
is
crazy
in
the
hood,
they
holla
my
name
If
it
ain't
about
the
flow,
it's
'bout
the
stones
and
the
chain
If
I
was
you,
I'd
love
me
too,
I
roll
like
a
boss
Nine
eleven
Porsche
same
color
as
cranberry

I
ain't

right,
rewinding
the
tape
Now
shorty
mama
in
precinct,
hollering
rape
I'm
convinced,
man,
something
really
wrong
with
these
ho's
I
thought
Lil'
Kim
was
hot,
'til
she
start
fucking
with
her
nose
I
used
to
listen
to
Lauryn
Hill,
and
tap
my
feet
Then
the
bitch
put
out
a
CD
and
didn't
have
no
beats
That
boy
D'Angelo,
he
determined
not
to
fail
That
nigga
went
butt-ass,
for
his
record
to
sell
My
back
shots
'll
help
Ashanti
hit
them
high
notes
And
Big
Ben
taught
Charli
B'More
to
deep
throat
(yea)
[Chorus]
[50
Cent]
I
love
the
burners,
the
money,
the
bunnies,
I
just
wanna
hold
you,
ha
ha
I
just
wanna
love
you,
yea
CHORUS
All
I
see
is
murder
murder,
my
mind
state
-
[2Pac]
Makes
it
too
late
for
cops
in
tryin'
to
stop
the
crime
rate
-
[Swift]
All
I
see
is
murder
murder,
my
mind
state
Murder,
murder,
murder,
and
kill,
kill,
kill!
(2x)
Left
the
keys
in
the
van,
with
a
gat
in
each
hand
Went
up
in
Eastland
and
shot
a
policeman
Fuck
a
peace
plan
of
citizen
bystands
But
shit
is
in
my
hands,
here's
your
life
span
For
what
your
life's
worth
this
money
is
twice
than
Grab
a
couple
grand
and
live
a
nice
land
See
I'm
a
nice
man
but
money
turned
me
to
Satan
I'm
thirsty
for
this
green
so
bad
I'm
dehydratin'
Hurry
up
with
the
cash
bitch,
I
got
a
ride
waitin'
Shot
a
man
twice
in
the
back
when
he
tried
escapin'
I
want
the
whole
plot,
I
won't
be
denied
nathan
Maybe
I
need
my
head
inside
straightened
Brain
contemplatin',
clean
out
the
register
Dip
before
somebody
catches
ya
Or
gets
ya
description
an'
sketches
ya
The
connection
was
the
prime
suspect
But
I
ain't
set
to
flee
the
scene
of
the
crime
just
yet
Cuz
I
got
a
daughter
to
feed
And
$200
ain't
enough
to
water
the
seed
The
best
thing
would
be
for
me
to
leave
Taco
Bell
an'
hit
up
Chess
King
And
have
the
lady
at
the
desk
bring
Money
from
the
safe
in
the
back,
stepped
in
wavin'
the
Mac
Cooperate
and
we
can
operate
and
save
an
attack
This
bitch
tried
escapin'
the
jack
Grabbed
her
by
the
throat,
it's
murder
she
wrote
You
barely
heard
a
word
as
she
choked
It
wasn't
nuttin'
for
her
to
be
smoked
But
I
slammed
her
on
her
back
'til
her
vertebrae
broke
Just
then
the
pigs
bust
in
yellin'
"Freeze!"
But
I'm
already
wanted
for
sellin'
keys
And
bunch
of
other
felonies
from
A
to
Z
like
spellin'
bees
So
before
I
dropped
to
the
ground
and
fell
on
knees
I
bust
shots,
they
bust
back
Hit
the
square
in
the
chest,
he
wasn't
wearin'
a
vest
CHORUS
2x
Left
the
house,
pullin'
out
the
drive
backin'
out
Need
a
backin'
out
this
lady's
Jag
started
blackin'
out
Pulled
the
Mac-10
out,
stuck
it
in
her
face
Shut
ya
yackin'
mouth
before
I
blow
the
brain
from
out
the
back
ya
scalp
Drug
her
by
her
hair,
smacked
her
up
Thinkin'
fuck
it,
mug
her
while
you're
there,
jacked
her
up
Stole
her
car,
made
a
profit
Grabbed
the
tape
from
out
the
deck
and
offed
it
out
the
window
Like
the
girl
on
Set
It
Off
did
Jetted
off
kid,
stole
the
whip,
now
I'm
a
criminal
Drove
in
thru
somebody's
yard,
dove
into
they
swimmin'
pool
Climbed
out
and
collapsed
on
the
patio
I
made
it
out
alive
but
I'm
injured
badly
though
Parents
screamin':
"Son,
go
in
and
call
the
police
Tell
'em
there's
a
crazy
man
disturbing
all
of
the
peace!"
Tried
to
stall
him
at
least
long
enough
to
let
me
leap
up
Run
in
they
crib
and
at
least
leave
with
some
little
cheap
stuff
Actin'
like
they
never
seen
nobody
hit
a
nick
before
Smashed
the
window,
grabbed
the
Nintendo
64
When
they
sell
out
in
stores
the
price
triples
I
ran
up
the
block
jumpin'
kids
on
tricycles
And
colliding
with
an
80-year
old
lady
with
groceries
There
goes
the
cheese,
eggs,
milk
and
Post
Toasties
Stood
up
and
started
to
see
stars
Too
many
siren
sounds,
it
seemed
like
a
thousand
police
cars
Barely
escaped,
must-a
been
some
dumb
luck
Jumped
up
and
climbed
the
back
of
a
movin'
dump
truck
But
I
think
somebody
seen
me
maybe
Plus
I
lost
the
damn
Nintendo
and
I
must-a
dropped
the
Beanie
Baby
Fuck
it
I
give
up,
I'm
surrounded
in
blue
suits
Came
out
with
a
white
flag
hollerin'
"TRUCE
TRUCE!"
Surrendered
my
weapon
to
cops
Wasn't
me!
It
was
the
gangsta
rap
and
the
peppermint
Schnopps
CHORUS
2x

Hi,

Do

(Yeah,

Wanna
see
me
stick
9
inch
nails
through
each
one
of

(Uh

Wanna
copy

and
do

(Yeah,

Try

(Huh?)
My

I'm
trying
to
get
my

straight
But
I
can't
figure
out
which
Spice
Girl
I
want
to
impregnate
(um...)
And
Dr.
Dre
said
"Slim
Shady,
you
a
basehead!"
Uh-uh!
"So
why's
your
face
red?
Man,
you
wasted!"
Well,
since
age
twelve
I
felt
like
I'm
someone
else
‘Cause
I
hung
my
original
self
from
the
top
bunk
with
a
belt
Got
pissed
off
and
ripped
Pamela
Lee's
tits
off,
and
smacked
her
so
hard
I
knocked
her
clothes
backwards
like
Kris
Kross
I
smoke
a
fat
pound
of
grass,
and
fall
on
my
ass
Faster
than
a
fat
bitch
who
sat
down
too
fast
Come
here,
slut!
"Shady,
wait
a
minute,
that's
my
girl,
dog!"
I
don't
give
a
fuck,
God
sent
me
to
piss
the
world
off

My

flunk
me
in
junior
high
Thanks
a
lot,
next
semester
I'll
be
35
I
smacked
him
in
his
face
with
an
eraser
Chased
him
with
a
stapler,
stapled
his
nuts
to
a
stack
of
papers
Walked
in
the
strip
club,
had
my
jacket
zipped
up
Flashed
the
bartender,
then
stuck
my
dick
in
the
tip
cup
Extraterrestrial,
running
over
pedestrians
in
a
spaceship
While
they're
screaming
at
me,
"Let's
just
be
friends!"
Ninety-nine
percent
of
my
life
I
was
lied
to
I
just
found
out
my
mom
does
more
dope
than
I
do
(damn)
I
told
her
I'd
grow
up
to
be
a
famous
rapper
Make
a
record
about
doing
drugs
and
name
it
after
her
You
know
you
blew
up
when
the
women
rush
your
stands
And
try
to
touch
your
hands
like
some
screaming
Usher
fans
This
guy
at
White
Castle
asked
for
my
autograph
(Dude,
can
I
get
your
autograph?)
So
I
signed
it:
"Dear

Dr.

don't

stand
there,
operate!
I'm
not

it's

scary
to
die
(Fuck

I'll
have
to
be
carried
inside
the
cemetery
and
buried
alive
(Yup)
Am
I
coming
or
going?
I
can
barely
decide
I
just
drank
a
fifth
of
vodka,
dare
me
to
drive?
(Go
ahead!)
All
my
life
I
was
very
deprived
I
ain't
had
a
woman
in
years
and
my
palm's
too
hairy
to
hide
(Whoops)
Clothes
ripped
like
the
Incredible
Hulk
I
spit
when
I
talk,
I'll
fuck
anything
that
walks
(Come
here!)
When
I
was
little
I
used
to
get
so
hungry
I
would
throw
fits
How
you
gonna
breastfeed
me,
Mom?
You
ain't
got
no
tits!
I
lay
awake
and
strap
myself
in
the
bed
Put
a
bulletproof
vest
on
and
shoot
myself
in
the
head
(Bang!)
I'm
steaming
mad
and
by
the
way,
when
you
see
my
dad
(Yeah?)
Tell
him
that
I
slit
his

Oh,

white
owner
[Verse
1
-
Lil
Wayne]
Throw
dirt
on
me
and
grow
a
wildflower
But
it's
"fuck
the
world",
get
a
child
out
her
Yeah,
my
life
a
bitch,
but
you
know
nothing
bout
her
Been
to
hell
and
back,
I
can
show
you
vouchers
I'm
rolling
Sweets,
I'm
smoking
sour
Married
to
the
game
but
she
broke
her
vows
That's
why
my
bars
are
full
of
broken
bottles
And
my
night
stands
are
full
of
open
Bibles
I
think
about
more
than
I
forget
But
I
don't
go
around
fire
expecting
not
to
sweat
And
these
niggas
know
I
lay
them
down,
make
their
bed
Bitches
try
to
kick
me
while
I'm
down:
I'll
break
your
leg
Money
outweighing
problems
on
the
triple
beam
I'm
sticking
to
the
script,
you
niggas
skipping
scenes
Be
good
or
be
good
at
it
Fucking
right
I've
got
my
gun,
semi-Cartermatic
Yeah,
put
a
dick
in
their
mouth,
so
I
guess
it's
"fuck
what
they
say"
I'm
high
as
a
bitch:
up,
up
and
away
Man,
I
come
down
in
a
couple
of
days
OK,
you
want
me
up
in
the
cage,
then
I'll
come
out
in
beast
mode
I
got
this
world
stuck
in
the
safe,
combination
is
the
G-code
It's
Weezy
motherfucker,
blood
gang
and
I'm
in
bleed
mode
All
about
my
dough
but
I
don't
even
check
the
peephole
So
you
can
keep
knocking
but
won't
knock
me
down
No
love
lost,
no
love
found
[Hook
-
Eminem
&
Lil
Wayne]
It's
a
little
too
late
to
say
that
you're
sorry
now
You
kicked
me
when
I
was
down
Fuck
what
you
say,
just
(don't
hurt
me,
don't
hurt
me
no
more)
That's
right
bitch:
and
I
don't
need
you,
don't
want
to
see
you
Bitch
you
get
(no
love)
You
show
me
nothing
but
hate
You
ran
me
into
the
ground
But
what
comes
around
goes
around
I
don't
need
you
(don't
hurt
me)
You
(don't
hurt
me
no
more)
That's
right,
and
I
don't
need
you,
don't
want
to
see
you
You
get
(no
love)
Bitch
you
get
(no
love)
And
I
don't
need
you
Get
em
[Verse
2
-
Eminem]
I'm
alive
again
More
alive
than
I
have
been
in
my
whole
entire
life
I
can
see
these
people's
ears
perk
up
as
I
begin
To
spaz
with
the
pen,
I'm
a
little
bit
sicker
than
most
Shit's
finna
get
thick
again
They
say
the
competition
is
stiff
But
I
get
a
hard
dick
from
this
shit,
now
stick
it
in
I
ain't
never
giving
in
again
Cuss
into
the
wind,
complete
freedom
Look
at
these
rappers,
how
I
treat
them
So
why
the
fuck
would
I
join
them
when
I
beat
them?
They
call
me
a
freak
because
I
like
to
spit
on
these
pussies
fore
I
eat
them
Man
get
these
whack
cocksuckers
off
stage
Where
the
fuck
is
Kanye
when
you
need
him?
Snatch
the
mic
from
him,
bitch
I'mma
let
you
finish
in
a
minute
Yeah
the
rap
is
tight
But
I'm
fucking
with
the
greatest
verse
of
all
time
So
you
might
want
to
go
back
to
the
lab
tonight
and
um
Scribble
out
them
rhymes
you
were
going
to
spit
And
start
over
from
scratch
and
write
new
ones
But
I'm
afraid
that
it
ain't
gonna
make
no
difference
When
I
rip
this
stage
and
tear
it
in
half
tonight
It's
an
adrenaline
rush
to
feel
the
bass
thump
In
the
place
all
the
way
to
the
parking
lot,
fellow
Set
fire
to
the
mic
and
ignite
the
crowd
You
can
see
the
sparks
from
hot
metal
Cold-hearted
from
the
day
I
Bogarted
the
game
I
so
started
to
rock
fellow
When
I'm
not
even
in
my
harshest
You
can
still
get
roasted
because
Marsh
is
not
mellow
Til
I'm
toppling
from
the
top
I'm
not
going
to
stop
I'm
standing
on
my
Monopoly
board
That
means
I'm
on
top
of
my
game
and
it
don't
stop
Til
my
hip
don't
hop
anymore
When
you
so
good
that
you
can't
say
it
Because
it
ain't
even
cool
for
you
to
sound
cocky
anymore
People
just
get
sick
cause
you
spit
These
fools
can't
drool
or
dribble
a
drop
anymore
And
you
can
never
break
my
stride
You
never
slow
the
momentum;
at
any
moment
I'm
about
to
blow
You'll
never
take
my
pride
Killing
the
flow,
slow
venom
and
the
opponent
Is
getting
no
mercy,
mark
my
words
Ain't
letting
up,
relentless
I
smell
blood,
I
don't
give
a
fuck:
keep
giving
them
hell
Where
was
you
when
I
fell
and
needed
help
up?
You
get
no
love.

Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
world's
on
fire
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
we're
never
getting
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
you're
told
We're
going
nowhere
fast
I
feel
sorry
for
this
beat
Sympathy
pains
for
this
track
This
road
is
taking
me
back
Down
memory
lane
with
this
rap
I
can
still
look
out
in
this
crowd
Be
wowed
and
be
taken
aback
I'm
simply
stating
a
fact
I
had
Wembley
Stadium
packed
But
now
we're
on
a
path
headed
to
nowhere
and,
fast
Another
terrorist
attack,
like
a
tariff
grows
Half
of
Madison
Square
up,
alas
We
perish
in
the
blast
but
that
doesn't
scare
us
We
pass
no
one,
we're
fearless
'Cause
we're
just
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
world's
on
fire
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
we're
never
getting
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
you're
told
We're
going
nowhere
fast
'Cause
we're
going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
nowhere
Going
nowhere
fast
Fuck
doing
what
you're
told,
act
like
a
two-year
old
Shit
is
soon
to
go
kaboom
and
blow
anyways
For
MC's
it's
a
funeral
when
I'm
devising
this
rhyme
'Cause
I'm
awake
and
you're
mourning
That's
why
I
rise
and
I
shine
Like
a
new
day
has
dawned
on
me
Gusto
guts
bravado
nuts
and
plus
I
kick
up
dust
and
cuss
a
lot
I
musta
got
you
in
somewhat
of
a
debacle
'Cause
some
stuff
that's
awful
really
don't
mean
nothing
all
though
There's
a
lot
of
shit
I
said
in
jest
that's
tough
to
swallow
But
if
at
times
my
heart
it
seems
like
it's
in
the
wrong
place
It's
probably
cause
it's
on
my
sleeve
Keanu
Reeves
speed
of
life
Avoid
or
veer
or
just
steer
toward
it
We're
only
looking
forward
but
Where
we're
going,
we
have
no
idea
Nowhere
to
go
but
hysterical
It's
getting
warm
in
here,
I
set
the
world
on
fire
Was
born
to
be
an
arsonist
Just
one
spark
and
it's
lit
But
I'ma
still
get
dark
on
this
shit
Told
you
I'd
leave
my
mark
on
this
bitch
War
machine
but
you've
forced
me
in
a
corner
I'm
sure
to
have
something
for
your
ear
And
in
the
course
of
the
assault
is
torture,
it's
more
severe
Go
to
war
with
me
or
end
up
blew
to
Timbuktu
I
send
at
you
a
ten
ton
nuke
like
Kim
Jong-Un
And
end
up
blewn
in
your
career
All
in
all,
it's
said
and
done
And
at
the
end
of
my
run,
I
just
rewind
clocks
Forever
young,
make
time
stop
Will
I
ever
fall
off,
that
day'll
never
come
To
the
Pine
box,
bitch
fuck
you
I'm
better
than
I
ever
was
'Til
the
bomb
drops,
hope
it
never
does
but
I'm
not
gonna
sweat
it
'cause
this
World's
screwed,
it's
already
fucked
and
I'm
on
top
So
everyone's
just
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
world's
on
fire
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
we're
never
getting
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
you're
told
We're
going
nowhere
fast
'Cause
we're
going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
nowhere
Going
nowhere
fast
You
can't
tell
us
nothing
Hard-headed
and
we're
stubborn
So,
one
ear
and
out
the
other
we're
young
Who
knows
what
the
future
for
us
could
hold
Another
shooter,
uh
oh
no
more
tomorrow's
we're
done
And
all
we
are
is
Ashes
blowing
in
the
air
Our
world's
on
fire
but
we
don't
care,
yeah
Wasted
youth,
always
on
the
road
Never
looking
back
and
we're
never
getting
old
'Cause
the
skies
are
black
but
our
hearts
made
of
gold
Fuck
doing
what
you're
told
We're
going
nowhere
fast
'Cause
we're
going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
no
Going
no,
going
nowhere
Going
nowhere
fast
[Eminem]
No
matter
what
people
say
I'm
gonna
keep
rapping
this
way
No
matter
what
you
may
think
I'm
gonna
keep
doing
my
thing
[Eminem]
I'm
almost
as
famous
as
fat
bald
men
Decided
to
write
songs
to
teach
Musketeers
to
sing
I
stick
Britney
Spears
in
a
room
full
of
mirrors
So
she
gets
fifty
years
of
bad
luck
[crash]
Causing
terror
to
Christina
Aguilera
When
I
grab
her
by
the
hair
and
drag
her
across
the
Sahara
Beware
of
this
rap
terrorist
with
a
therapist
With
a
hair
up
his
ass
like
a
rabbit
crawled
in
his
pants
Gotta
have
it,
I
hold
Tylenol
in
his
hands
'til
it
melts
in
his
fucking
palms
and
dissolves
in
his
glands
(So
who
is
it?)
The
fool
who
visit
the
playground
With
two
biscuits
to
lay
down
the
school
district
Get
pistol
whipped
with
a
Mauseburg
With
a
pistol
grip
and
fed
pitbulls
shit
Sniff
glue
sticks
like
I
give
two
shits
If
I
get
too
rich,
I
just
get
sued
[Redman]
Yo,
I
leave
with
no
injure,
after
I
blow
four
in
you
One
handstand
on
top
of
your
ninja
Crash

(ERRRR)
Doc

madness
'til

Walking,

laundry
basket
America's

army
after

Fuck

A
low
fifteen
like
a
ace
in
four
I'm
outta
work,
but
Doc
laid
them
off
(shit,
the
power's
out)
The
tape
is
off
Yo,

arsonists
Papermate
pens
filled
with
arsenic
I
got
hoes
that
don't
know

Prada

Doc

touch
your
barber

Betty

I

Crystal
Lake
Fuck

'Cause

[Eminem]
So

Hope

the
mood
to
get
drunk
and
scream
in
a
fight
'Cause

[Redman]
Yo,

'Cause

So

Off

My

Aimed
at
the
nose
of
them

it's
hard
to
breathe
from
Flash
the
gat,
your
town,
bogardin'
Your
wallet,
your
chain
the
main
target
Beef
is
like
cold
engine,
don't
start
it
Bust
in
the
air
and
hit
a
airplane
pilot
We
clowned

rap
surround
sounds
around
you
From

speed
and

Doc

It's

Got

Pop

Popped

Knock

it's
all
good,
thank
God
for
Vodka
'Cause
with
my
luck,
I'll
probably
get
shot
by
a
stalker
Probably
got
a
fanatic
waiting
upstairs
in
the
attic
With
an
automatic
calling
me
up
there
My
man
Stan
with
a
gat
in
his

Staking
my
house
out
in
a
tan
tinted
Sedan
He
pull
your

'til
you
can't
finish
a
damn
Ham
sandwich,
or
your
can
spinach
and
Spam
'til

gotta
sip
through
a
straw,
shoplifted
a

Pictures

Hey

Sike

Arrive

and
pull
me
off
of
Kim
Teeth
off
my
dick,
hands
off
my
balls
But
you
all

kiss
my
ass,
pants
off
and
all
'Cause
I'm
so
goddamn
off
the
wall
I
might
as
well
as

a
painting
smashed
on
the
floor
[Redman]
So

[Intro]
Oh
no
what's
happening
to
my
brain
I
can't
believe
this
is
happening
again
[Verse
1]
Lava
out
my
lips
I
flips
Wake
up
think
I
have
a
cramp
I'm
trying
to
shove
the
lava
lamp
up
my
father's
ass
I
think
I'm
out
of
gas,
man
I
think
I
need
another
mask
I'd
ask
my
mother
but
I
think
she's
laughing
at
the
plants
A
half
a
gram
of
graham
crackers
and
some
Van
de
Kamp's
I
think
I'll
eat
some
Ambiens
like
they're
candied
yams
Cut
a
couple
cadavers
up
and
have
a
little
snack
Abraf-ckingcadabra
motherf-cker
look
who's
back
Just
like
a
pendulum,
Satan's
pentagram
swings
I
accidentally
dented
it
and
bent
the
damn
thing
Shit
I
think
I
might
have
did
it
when
I
was
dancing
While
I
was
chopping
one
of
my
legs
off
and
pulled
a
hamstring
First
I
Re-up,
then
I
Relapse
Go
to
rehab
then
I
Detox
after
I
see
Doc
And
I'll
be
back
with
the
sequel,
repeat
the
cycle
Cause
I
react
like
the
She-Hulk
when
I
see
Nyquil
[Hook]
Oh
no
Here
we
go
again
When
it's
going
to
end
Where
did
it
begin
Maybe
way
back
when
[Verse
2]
Into
the
well,
baby
Jessica
fell
She
may
have
wetted
herself
Quit
playing,
get
her
some
help
Mary
Kay
Letourneau
sending
me
letters
from
jail
Every
day
in
journals
saying
how
She
wanted
to
smother
me
in
lettuce
and
mayo
I'm
the
medicine
man
My
medical
marijuana
was
prescribed
by
a
doctor
Shove
a
typewriter
up
her
Perez
Hilton's
ass,
shit,
almost
forgot
that
He's
always
shoving
something
up
his
ass
so
why
not
that?
And
f-ck
it
while
I'm
venting
let's
shove
a
vending
machine
Up
his
rear
end
when
he's
bending
over
pretending
that
he
Didn't
say
anything
that
would
be
offending
to
me
Stick
his
head
in
a
blender,
begin
blending
in
G
Where
should
I
put
the
pink
sissy
with
the
fluffy
hair?
Put
him
under
the
stairs?
People
are
already
under
there
Hmm,
I
wonder
where.
Wait,
I
think
the
cubpoard's
bare
Stuff
him
up
in
the
tupperware
and
shove
him
up
in
there
[Hook]
[Verse
3]
Vicodin's
like
a
nitrogen
hydrogen
vitamin
I
bite
into
five
and
then
I
get
high
as
a
kite
again
I
like
it
when
I
get
in
my
zone
on
the
mic
again
Who
am
I
kidding?
I
couldn't
quit
this
shit
if
my
life
depends
I
relapsed
twice
after
I
came
outta
Brighton
then
Yeah,
rehab's
nice,
I
had
my
name
up
in
lights
again
You
see
that's
why
I
can't
decipher
what
life
I'm
in
I
might
pull
a
knife
on
your
wife
and
slice
her
and
dice
her
then
It
sounds
so
enticing,
isn't
it
nice
when
I'm
hype
again?
I'm
nice
when
I'm
like
this,
no
time
to
write
just
type
it
in
If
I
could
get
my
pen
to
slow
down,
what'd
I
write
just
then?
Man
I'm
about
to
hyperventilate,
I
just
have
hyper-tension
I
have
the
type
of
mental
state
you
couldn't
comprehend
Unusually
stupid
of
you
for
you
to
think
I'm
your
friend
I
usually
do
what
I
do
and
suffer
no
consequence
I
offer
no
mercy,
the
controversy
is
once
again
[Hook]
Paroles
de
la
chanson
Phenomenal
par
Eminem
I
am
phenomenal
With
every
ounce
of
my
blood
With
every
breath
in
my
lungs
Won't
stop
until
I'm
phe-no-menal
I
am
phenomenal
However
long
that
it
takes
I'll
go
to
whatever
rates
It's
gonna
make
me
a
monster
though
I
am
phenomenal
But
I
would
never
say,
‘Oh,
it’s
impossible’
Cause
I'm
gonna
be
phenomenal
Unstoppable,
unpoppable
thought
bubbles
Untoppable
thoughts,
fuckin'
juggernaut
that'll
Stomp
you
in
the
verse,
obstacles
I'm
drawn
to
'em
When
the
going
got
rough
Show
‘em
what
I
done
thought
that
was
the
worse,
little
sissy
Who
the
fuck
taught
you
how
to
persevere?
There
ain't
no
situation
that
you
ever
had
to
respond
to
that's
adverse
The
messiest
thing
you've
ever
gone
through
is
your
purse
Yeah,
I
don't
try
like
Captain,
I
might
as
well
Hang
it
up
like
a
shelf,
gotta
keep
growin'
with
it,
evolve
Cause
you
can
keep
throwin'
shit
at
the
wall
But
you're
gonna
find
that
nothing's
gonna
stick
until
you
apply
yourself
Time
to
slip
in
that
zone
till'
I
find
myself
Inside
the
realm
where
the
unknown
and
boldly
go
In
the
waters
where
nobody
else
has
gone
before
Or
willing
to
go,
uncharted,
feeling
is
so
Bomb,
I'm
feelin'
myself,
I'm
a
giant
Sometimes
I
gotta
remind
myself
that
I
am...
I
am
phenomenal
With
every
ounce
of
my
blood
With
every
breath
in
my
lungs
Won't
stop
until
I'm
phe-no-menal
I
am
phenomenal
However
long
that
it
takes
I'll
go
to
whatever
rates
It's
gonna
make
me
a
monster
though
I
am
phenomenal
But
I
would
never
say,
‘Oh,
it’s
impossible’
Cause
I'm
gonna
be
phenomenal
Let
me
self-empower
you
When
you're
down
and
they're
tryin'
to
clown
the
fuck
out
of
you
When
you
feel
like
you're
runnin'
out
of
fuel
I'll
show
you
how
to
use
doubt
as
fuel
Convert
it
to
gunpowder
too
Now
what
you
do
is
put
the
match
to
the
charcoal
fluid
Put
a
spark
to
it
like
Martha
Stewart
barbecuing
Ah
screw
it,
feel
like
you
want
to
hit
that
wall
then
do
it
Punch
through
it,
just
cock
back,
put
your
all
into
it
Now
you
gon'
take
that
rage
and
make
that
what
you
raise
Never
take
back
what
you
say
If
you
stay
trapped
in
your
brain,
engage
in
this
fueled
cage
match
Ready
to
scrap
asap
Take
your
fists
to
his
bones
Show
Biggie
who's
smallest
you're
Christopher
Wallace
Yeah
I
picture
'em
all
as
plastic
and
foam
Lays
flat,
where
you
put
your
dinner
plates
at
And
set
it
off
like
a
placemat
(I
am
phenomenal)
And
I
want
you
to
say
that
I
am
phenomenal
With
every
ounce
of
my
blood
With
every
breath
in
my
lungs
Won't
stop
until
I'm
phe-no-menal
I
am
phenomenal
However
long
that
it
takes
I'll
go
to
whatever
rates
It's
gonna
make
me
a
monster
though
I
am
phenomenal
But
I
would
never
say,
‘Oh,
it’s
impossible’
Cause
I'm
gonna
be
phenomenal
Said
I
need
you
to
make
a
note
And
find
yourself,
your
glory,
free
your
person
Is
that
a
fuckin’
mouth
with
no
shut-up
valve?
Can't
even
cut
the
power
to
it,
when
it's
what
allowed
Me
to
come
up
out
from
under
the
fuckin'
ground
Cause
I
worked
my
butt
off
now
It's
a
subject
I
don't
know
how
to
shut
up
about
Cause
I
stuck
it
out
Like
a
mothafuckin'
tongue
to
tie,
I
responded
when
I
got
shoved
around
You're
gonna
have
down
believers
But
when
you're
beyond
belief,
you
probably
shouldn't
wonder
how
Get
it
how
you
live
But
are
you
prepared
to
give
more
than
you
get?
And
put
in
twice
what
you
get
back
from
this
shit
Though
what
you
sacrifice
barely
is
half,
never
give
Rap
is
my
shift
But
it's
like
my
shield
at
the
same
time
I
wield,
I'ma
knife
this
will
Sometimes
I
feel
just
like
B.
Real
from
Cypress
Hill
How
I
can
just
kill
a
cypher,
survivor's
guilt
I
rhyme
like
life
is
still
an
uphill
climb
Ready
to
face
it,
each
challenge
waitin'
Taste
it,
it's
salivation,
I'm
wagin'
retaliation
Look
what
I
have
built,
reputation
is
delegation
The
only
thing
I'm
capable
of
makin'
is
amazing
Only
thing
you're
capable
of
makin'
is
a
false
statement
An
accusation...
I
am
legendary
status,
in
fact
That
is
the
only
way
you'll
ever
be
able
to
say
Your
legend
is
makin'
an
allegation
I
write
with
the
left,
same
hand
I
hold
the
mic
with
As
I
fight
to
the
death,
'til
my
last
breath
Managed
to
prove
who
the
best
man
is
Surveil
it,
all
cards
be
the
only
ones
left
standing
In
the
end,
but
I
ain't
gonna
be
the
only
one
with
the
advantage
Of
knowing
what
it's
like
to
be
southpaw
Cause
you
can
bet
your
ass
you'll
be
left
handed
I
am
phenomenal
With
every
ounce
of
my
blood
With
every
breath
in
my
lungs
Won't
stop
until
I'm
phe-no-menal
I
am
phenomenal
However
long
that
it
takes
I'll
go
to
whatever
rates
It's
gonna
make
me
a
monster
though
I
am
phenomenal
But
I
would
never
say,
‘Oh,
it’s
impossible’
Cause
I'm
gonna
be
phenomenal
[Eminem]
Yo..
I
dedicate
to
this..
to
yo..
{*imitating
Slick
Rick*}
To
all
my
fans,
keepin
y'all
in
health
Let's
tell
this
Whitey
Ford
to
go
fuck
himself
Cause
it's
cruel
when
you
cause
a
bad
heart
conditionin
which
I
create,
cause
that's
my
mission
So
listen
close,
to
what
we
say
because
this
type
of
fag
claims
to
never
be
gay,
I..
{*rapping
normally*}
..
knew
you
was
jealous
from
the
day
that
I
met
you
I
upset
you,
cause
I
get
respect
I
pet
you
(boy)
I'm
even
liked
better
by
your
niece
and
nephew
(c'mon!)
And
now
you
hate
Fred
because
Lethal
left
you
Peckerwood
mad
cause
his
record
went
wood
No
respect
in
the
hood,
fled
to
his
neck
of
the
woods
Got
in
touch
with
his
roots,
found
the
redneck
in
his
blood
and
said,
"Heck,
country
western
rap
records
are
good!!"
So
he
picks
the
guitar
up
and
he
strums
a
few
notes
He
can't
rap,
or
sing,
but
he
wants
to
do
both
(haha)
Puts
an
album
out
and
rules
for
part
of
the
year
then
Kid
Rock
and
Limp
Bizkit
come
from
out
of
nowhere
It's
the
start
of
an
era,
rock
rap's
harder
this
year
No
one's
tryin
to
hear
some
fuckin
old
fart
in
a
chair
sittin
on
stage,
strummin
acoustic
guitar
in
your
ear
So
you
start
to
get
scared,
sit
back
and
spark
an
idea
Figure
you
can
diss
me
to
jump
start
your
career
I
punch
you
in
your
fuckin
chest
'til
your
heart
kicks
in
gear
(bitch)
And
fuck
your
underground
buddy's
nameless
crew
Like
I'ma
say
they
names
so
they
can
be
famous
too
[Chorus
2X:
Eminem
*sung*]
You
just
a..
quitter,
and
you
bitter
cause
I
came
along
and
the
days
of
House
of
Pain
are
gone
And
if
you
talk
about
my
little
girl
in
a
song
again
I'ma
kill
you
(I'ma
kill
you)
[Eminem]
Yo..
heart
attack
to
stroke
from
the
crack
you
smoke
to
the
rap
you
wrote,
your
fuckin
answer
back's
a
joke
And
I'ma
tell
these
motherfuckin
fans
the
truth
The
reason
why
you
dissed
me
first
and
I
answered
you
You
said
I
passed
you
in
a
lobby
and
I
glanced
at
you
like
I
ain't
notice
you?BITCH,
I
had
a
show
to
do!
Like
I'm
supposed
to
be
star-struck,
come
over
to
you
You
better
shut
your
fuckin
mouth
while
you
oh-for-two
Back
in
ninety-four
Limp
opened
the
show
for
you
Rocked
the
crowd
better
and
stole
the
whole
show
from
you
Took
your
motherfuckin
DJ
and
stole
him
too
So
you
fall
in
a
slump
and
get
all
emotional
So
now
you
sing
and
mix
slang
with
blues
and
pluck
strings
Confused
as
fuck
cause
now
your
music
sucks
dick
Mr.
Mr.
Ass
Kisser
to
get
accepted
in
rap
quicker
but
never
last,
and
Everlast
is
a..
[Chorus]
Aight
listen
(look)
So
this
is
what
we
ask
of
our
fans
If
you
ever
see
Everlast,
WHOOP
HIS
ASS
Hit
him
with
sticks,
bricks,
rocks,
throw
shit
at
him

Aiyyo..
Some
days
I
just
wanna
up
and
call
it
quits,
I
feel
like
i'm
surrounded
by
a
wall
of
bricks,
everytime
I
go
to
get
up
I
just
fall
in
piss,
my
life's
like
one
great
big
ball
of
shit,
if
I
could
just
put
it
all
in
all
I
spit,
instead
I
always
try
to
swallow
it,
instead
of
staring
at
this
wall
and
shit,
while
I
sit
writers
block
sick
of
all
this
shit,
cant
call
it
shit,
all
I
know
is
i'm
about
to
hit
the
wall,
if
I
have
to
see
another
one
of
mom's
alchaholic
fits,
this
is
it,
last
straw,
thats
all,
thats
it,
I
aint
dealing
with
another
fucking
politic,
i'm
like
a
stewin
bubble
in
him,
till
it
filters
up,
i'm
about
to
kill
it,
I
can
feel
it
building
up,
blow
this
building
up,
i've
been
sealed
enough,
my
cup
run
it
over
i've
been
filled
up,
but
then
explosion
bust
and
spills
my
guts,
you
think
all
I
do
is
stand
here
and
feel
my
nuts,
but
i'm
a
show
you
what,
you
gonna
feel
my
rush,
you
dont
feel
it
then
it
must
be
too
real
to
touch,
feel
to
touch,
i'm
about
to
tear
shit
up,
goosebumps,
yeah
i'm
make
your
hair
sit
up,
yeah
sit
up,
i'm
a
tell
you
who
I
be,
i'm
make
you
hate
me
cause
you
aint
me,
you

it
aint
to
late
to
finally
see,
what
you
close
minded
fucks
were
too
blind
to
see,
whoever
find
me,
is
gonna
get
a
finders
fee,
out
this
world
and
aint
no
one
out
there
mind
as
me,
you
need
peace
of
mind,
well
here's
a
piece
of
mine,
all
I
need's
a
line
but
sometimes,
I
dont
always
find
the
words
to
rhyme,
to
express
how
i'm
really
feeling
at
that
time,
yeah
sometimes,
sometimes,
sometimes,
just
sometimes,
its
always
me,
how
dark
can
these
hallways
be,
the
clock
stikes
midnight,
1,
2,
then
half
past
3,
this
half
ass
rhyme
with
this
half
ass
piece
of
paper,
(Tear)

Well
Jimmy

in
with
his
mother
Cos
he

no
place
to

And
now
i'm
right
back
in
the
gutter
With
a
garbage
bag
that's
full
of
clothes
Cause

What

hell

Cuz

in

Mom

Jimmy
He's

Greg
Buehl
Me
and
him
and

we
went
to
the
same
school
This
ain't
cool...
I'm
in
a
rage
He's
tapping
my
mom
and
we're
almost
the
same
age
On
the
microphone
i
drop
bombs
Look
at
this
car...
'Thanks

lot,
Mom!'
"Here
and
happy
birthday
Rabbit!
Here's
a
brand
new
car,
you

have
it.
A
1928
Delta..."
This
shit
won't
even
get
me
to
the
shelter
And
I

stand
for
mowtown
Cuz

It's
not
about
lyrics
anymore,
it's
about
a
hot
beat
and
a
catchy
hook
[Eminem]
If
we
gotta
dumb
down
our
style
and
ABC
it
Then
so
be
it
Cause
nowadays
these
kids,
jeez
Don't
give
a
shit
bout
lyrics
All
they
wanna
hear
is
a
beat
and
thats
it
Long
as
they
can
go
to
the
club
and
get
blitz
Pick
up
some
chicks
and
get
some
digits
And
the
DJ's
playing
them
hits
Oh
this
my
jam,
this
my
shit
We
don't
know
a
word
to
a
verse,
All
we
know
is
the
chorus
Cause
the
chorus
repeats
the
same
four
words
for
us
And
the
songs
ginormous,
the
whole
formula's
switched
Cause
we
don't
know
anymore,
what
are
hits
Is
it
the
beat,
is
it
the
rap
Is
it
a
finger
snap
or
the
same
808
clap
And
how
do
we
adapt
and
get
TRL
votes
When
13
year
olds
control
the
remote
And
Ashley's
got
a
brand
new
nose
We
gotta
put
some
new
em-phasis
on
our
syllables
[Jay-Z]
If
the
emphasis
on
the
compact
disc
isn't
the
beat
Than
I'm
gon
feature
EM
and
get
rich
And
let
Dre
mix
the
shit
and
drive
off
in
the
Range
Ro
Cause
everywhere
I
go
they
love
the
bling
bling
flow
Bang
bang
look
at
the
way
my
chain
glow
The
ring
on
my
fing'
cost
Jermaine
a
lot
of
dough,
oh
The
fuck
am
I
busting
my
brain
for?
Its
just
the
way
the
game
go,
oh,
it
takes
2
to
tango
You
call
this
a
lame
flow
You
bought
the
shit
I
guess
you
to
blame
too
I
just
found
the
angle
No
more
reality
flow
I'm
tryna
time
my
album
dropping
with
a
reality
show
Cock
the
Mac
11
in
front
of
Hot
97
And
call
my
publicist
tell
her
"we
in
press
heaven"
No
one
gives
a
shit
except
some
kids
who
just
got
into
sex
on
the
internet
So
you
want
the
chat
room
or
the
house
of
Malibu
Em?
Your
emphasis
is
on
the
wrong
Syllable
[Dr
Dre]
They
said
30's
the
new
20
Funny,
must
mean
40's
the
new
30
Interesting
cause
ever
since
then
it's
been
innocence
An
extension
for
veteran
rappers
that
are
better
than
half
Of
the
shit
coming
out
right
now
Its
all
trash
The
torch
is
gonna
burn
out
before
it
gets
passed
Jay
said
it's
his
last
and
50
and
Em
Then
what?
Detox
drops
what
we
got
then
So
now
our
whole
camps
is
running
around
scrambling
over
what
to
do
Gambling
everytime
we
put
a
record
out
Just
looking
for
that
hook
[Eminem]
(Wait
Dre
look)
Shorty
I

you
And

We

You

Puffing

Don't

Shady

me
for
bringing

back
For
the
history
of
rap
It's
gone
with
a
snap,
a
sneer
and
a
clap
What
happened
to
just
spittin
about
living
in
the
muthafucking
city

In
the
grimiest
condition,
I
breath
in
drama
King
Mathers
and
Cash
me,
that's
freak
karma
I'm
everything,
anything,
you
could
never
be
Its
a
hitting,
rhyme
in
the
month
deep
I
speak
with
a

no
peace
on

I
repeat
every

No

Plus

You

line
And

with
a
razor
blade,
yo

I'm
an
a-hole,

Halo
Hell

Say

Blue

Two

Chainz
Ropes

It

for
the
trailer
park,
two
for
my
baby-ma
Three
for
the
tater
tots,
four
if
you
ate
a
lot
Five
if

while
I'm
shittin'
on
my
comp'
I'm
about
to
use
the
John
(What?)
like
Grey
Poupon
(Dijon;
woo!)
Money
like
a
scroll,
bitch,
my
paper
long
(Yeah)
Longer
than
it
takes
a
blonde
to
put
her
makeup
on
(Yeah)
'Cause
me
and
Elvis
gelled
together
like
cellmates
(Hey!)
Yeah,
this
the
Jailhouse,
bitch,
and
I
don't
give
a–
(What?)
And
I
don't
give
a
shit
about
a
thing
you
say
I
just
wanna
feel
like
a
king
today
And
if
you
don't
like
it
you
can
sit
and
spin
Middle
fingers
up
(Yeah),
we
'bout
to
do
this
shit
again
Modus
operandi,
bottle
of
blond
dye
(Yeah)
Top
five
since
I
discovered
peroxide
(What?)
Yeah,
since
I
got
signed
(Woo!),
I
went
from
pot
pies
To
Jack
and
the
Bean–
(Huh?),
I'm
watchin'
my
stock
rise
(Woo!)
These
little
attention
seekers,
I'm
finna
treat
'em
like
diabetics
(What?)
Got
'em
all
on
pins
and
needles
(Yeah),
just
like
Ozempic,
meaning
Give
these
little
pricks
the
finger,
and
when
I
stick
this
thing
up
It's
higher
than
Wiz
Khalifa
(Woo!),
soon
as
he
lit
the
weed
up
(Huh?)
As
I
go
pickin'
speed
up
(Where?),
like
I
was
finna
re-up
(Yeah)
Rap
is
my
new
Vicodin,
Suboxene
is
how
I
treat
it
(Get
it?)
Still
goin'
toe-to-toe,
I'm
still
boxing
with
all
my
demons
(Yeah)
But
a
couple
Xanny
bars
and
I'm
Danny
Gar–,
see
ya!
Been
stuntin'
on
you
from
the
jump
like
Evel
Knievel
Back
in
the
cut
and
stackin'
chips
up
like
a
can
of
Pringles
Sometimes
I
feel
like
Pete
Rose
(Why?),
I
got
so
many
hit
singles
(Yeah)
Bitch,
I
barely
have
any
wrinkles,
you
sleepin'
on
me
like
I'm
ZzzQuil
So
I
don't
give
a
shit
about
a
thing
you
say
I
just
wanna
feel
like
a
king
today
And
if
you
don't
like
it
you
can
sit
and
spin
Middle
fingers
up,
we
'bout
to
do
this
shit
again
And
it
goes:
one
for
the
trailer
park,
two
for
my
baby-ma
Three
for
the
tater
tots,
four
if
you
ate
a
lot
Five
if
you
came
to
rock
and
you
never
gave
a
fuck
Middle
fingers
up,
we
'bout
to
do
this
shit
again
I
stole
black
music,
yeah
true
Perhaps
used
it
(For
what?)
as
a
tool
to
combat
school
Kids
came
back
on
some
bathroom
shit
Now
I
call
a
hater
a
bidet
(Why?)
'Cause
they
mad
that
they
can't
do
shit
(Haha)
And
I
know
I'm
such
a
dick,
huh?
(Yeah)
And
it
must
be
fuckin'
with
ya
(Yeah)
To
know
I
up
and
quit
the
(What?)
Prescription
drugs
and
liquor
(Yeah)
And
yet
my
buzz
is
bigger
(Wow)
Still
rappin'
circles
around
you
(Yeah)
Like
a
boa
constrictor
(Break
it
down)
Now
I'm
about
to
explain
to
you
all
the
parallels
Between
Elvis
and
me,
myself
It
seem
obvious:
one,
he's
pale
as
me
Second,
we
both
been
hailed
as
kings
He
used
to
rock
the
Jailhouse,
and
I
used
to
rock
The
Shelter
We
sell
like
Velveeta
Shells
&
Cheese
(Woo!
Let's
go!)
But
y'all
miss
the
meaner
me,
back
when
I
had
felonies
That
went
over
your
head
because
you
just
fell
on
knees
You
just
literally
knelt
to
me,
I
used
to
have
no
self-esteem
(Yeah)
I
used
to
cry
myself
to
sleep
(What?)
Honestly,
I
need
doubters
because
you
motherfuckers
(Yeah)
Motivate
me
to
make
you
look
stupid
Believers,
a
little
faith
is
all
I
seek
from
you
All
I
need
to
do
is
hear
you
say
the
same
shit
My
father
said
to
me
when
I
was
just
a
week
or
two
"Marshall,
I
be
leavin'
you"
(Haha,
stupid)
No
more
Guinness
Stout,
but
my
belief
in
myself
Once
again
is
stout
(Yeah),
so
many
world
records,
I'm
Guinness'ed
out
(Huh?)
Shit
you
say
goes
in
and
out
(Oh)
My
ear
canals,

my
hearing's
out
Or
I
don't
give
a
shit
about
a
thing
you
say
I
just
wanna
feel
like
a
king
today
And
if
you
don't
like
it
you
can
sit
and
spin
Middle

Wow
Mariah,

Bitch

'fore
I
put
all
them
phone
calls
out
you
made
to
my
house
when
you
was
(Wild'n
Out)
before
Nick
When
you
was
on
my
dick
and
give
you
somethin
to
smile
about
How
many
times
you
fly
to
my
house,
still
tryin
to
count
Better
shut
your
lyin
mouth
if
you
don't
want
Nick
findin
out
You
probably
think
cause
it's
been
so
long
if
I
had
somethin
on
you
I
woulda
did
it
by
now
Oh
on
the
contrary
Mary
Poppins
I'm
mixin
our
studio
session
down
and
sendin
it
to
masterin
to
make
it
loud
Enough
dirt
on
you
to
murder
you
This
is
what
the
fuck
I
do,
Mariah
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
I
still
have
pictures?
However
you
prefer
to
do
and
that
goes
for
Nick
too,
faggot
you
think
I'm
scurred
of
you?
You're
gonna
ruin
my
career
you

get
one
Like
I'ma
sit
and
fight
with
you
over
some
slut
bitch
cunt
that
made
me
put
up
with
her
psycho
ass
over
six
months
And
only
spread
her
legs
to
let
me
hit
once
Yeah,
what
you
gonna
say
I'm
lucky?
Tell
the
public
that
I
was
so
ugly
that
you
fuckin
had
to
be
drunk
to
fuck
me?
Second
base,
what
the
fuck
you
tell
Nick
pumpkin?
The
second
week
we
were
dry
humpin,
that's
gotta
count
for
somethin
Listen
girly,
surely
you
don't
want
me
to
talk
about
how
I
nutted
early
cause
I
ejaculated
prematurely
And
bust
all
over
your
belly
and
you
almost
started
hurling
and
said
I
was
gross,
go
get
a
towel,
your
stomach's
curling
Or
maybe
you
do,
but
if
I'm
embarrassin
me
I'm
embarrassin
you
And
don't
you
dare
say
it
isn't
true
As
long
as
that
song's
gettin
airplay
I'm
dissin
you
I'm
a
hair
away
from
gettin
carried
away
and
gettin
sued
I
was
gonna
stop
at
16,
that
was
32
This
is
34
bars,
we
ain't
even
third
of
the
way
through
"Damn
Slim,
Mariah
play
you,"
Mariah
who?
Oh,
did
I
say
whore
Nick?
I
meant
a
liar
too
Like
I
been
goin
off
on
you
all
this
time
for
no
reason,
girl
you
out
your
alcoholic
mind
Check
your
wine
cellar,
look
at
the
amounts
of
all
the
wine
Like
I
fuckin
sit
around
and
think
about
you
all
the
time
I
just
think
this
shit
is
funny
when
I
pounce
you
on
a
rhyme
But
fuck
it
now
I'm
'bout
to
draw
the
line
And
for
you
to
cross
it
that's
a
mountain
that
I
doubt
you
wanna
climb
I
can
describe
areas
of
your
house
you
wouldn't
find
on
an
episode
of
"Cribs,"
a
blow
below
the
ribs
If
I
hear
another
word
so
don't
go
openin
your
jibs
Cause
every
time
you
do
it's
like
an
overload
of
fibs
I
ain't
sayin
this
shit
again
hoe,
you
know
what
it
is
It's
a
warnin
shot,
'fore
I
blow
up
your
whole
spot
Call
my
bluff
and,
I'll
release
every
fuckin
thing
I
got
Including
the
voicemails
right
before
you
flipped
your
top
when
me
and
Luis
were
tryin
to
stick
two
CD's
in
the
same
slot
[Interlude]
"Slim
Shady...
"
"Slim
Shady..."
[Eminem
{Mariah
Carey
samples}]
{"I
love
you"}
I
love
you
too
Let
me
whisper
sweet
nothings
into
your
ear
boo
Now
what
you
say?
{"It's
nothin"}
Yeah
so
what
I'll
do
is
refresh
your
memory
when
you
said
{"I
want
you"}
Now
should
I,
keep
goin
or
should
we
call
truce?
{"You
think
you're
cute,
right?"}
You
bet
your
sweet
ass
I
do
{"I'm
Mary
Poppins,
B"}
And
I'm
Superman,
ooh
{"Mary
P
-
Slim
Shady"}
Comin
at
you
So
if
you'll
still
be
my
{"Baby
girl"}
Then
I'll
still
be
your
{"Superhero"}
{"Wilma
M."}
Yeah,
I'm
right
here
{"You
like
this!"}
Nope,
not
anymore
dear
It
cuts
like
a
{"knife"}
when
I
tell
you
get
a
{"life"}
But
I'm
movin
on
with
mine,
Nick,
is
that
your
{"wife"}
Well
tell
her
to
shut
her
mouth
then
I'll
leave
her
alone
If
she
don't
{"stick
to
the
script"}
then
I'ma
just
keep
goin
Damn
[Outro]
"I
see
Mary
Ann,
Mary
Ann's
sayin
cut
the
tape
Cut
the
tape,
knife!"
Cause
sometimes
you
just
feel
tired,
feel
weak
And
when
you
feel
weak,
you
feel
like
you
wanna
just
give
up
But
you
gotta
search
within
you,
and
gotta
find
that
inner
strength,
and
just
pull
that
shit
out
of
you
And
get
that
motivation
to
not
give
up
And
not
be
a
quitter,
no
matter
how
bad
you
wanna
just
fall
flat
on
your
face,
and
collapse
Till
I
collapse
I'm
spilling
these
raps
long
as
you
feel
'em
Till
the
day
that
I
drop
you'll
never
say
that
I'm
not
killing
'em
Cause
when
I
am
not,
then
I'mma
stop
penning
'em
And
I
am
not
hip
hop
and
I'm
just
not
Eminem
Subliminal
thoughts,
when
I'ma
stop
sending
'em?
Women
are
caught
in

spin
'em
and
hock

Adrenaline
shots
of

could
not
get

Amoxicillin's

The

A

millions
of
Pac
listeners
You're
coming
with
me,
feel
it
or
not,
you're
gonna
fear
it
Like
I
showed
you
the
spirit
of
God
lives
in
us
You
hear
it
a
lot,
lyrics
to
shock
Is
it
a
miracle
or
am
I
just
product
of
pop
fizzin'
up?
Fa
shizzel
my
wizzel,
this
is
the
plot,
listen
up
You
bizzels
forgot,
Slizzel
does
not
give
a
fuck
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut

Till
the

Perhaps
I'ma

Music
is
like
magic,
there's
a
certain
feeling
you
get
When
you
real
and
you
spit,
and
people
are
feeling
your
shit
This
is
your
moment,
and
every
single
minute
you
spend
Tryna
hold
on
to
it
because
you
may
never
get
it
again
So
while
you're
in
it,
try
to
get
as
much
shit
as
you
can
And
when
your
run
is
over
just
admit
when
it's
at
its
end
Because
I'm
at
the
end
of
my
wits
with
half
the
shit
that
gets
in
I
got
a
list,
here's
the
order
of
my
list
that
it's
in
It
goes
Reggie,
Jay-Z,
2Pac
and
Biggie
Andre
from
OutKast,
Jada,
Kurupt,
Nas
and
then
me
But
in
this
industry
I'm
the
cause
of
a
lot
of
envy
So
when
I'm
not
put
on
this
list
the
shit
does
not
offend
me
That's
why
you
see
me
walk
around
like
nothing's
bothering
me
Even
though
half
you
people
got
a
fuckin'
problem
with
me
You
hate
it
but
you
know
respect
you
got
to
give
me
The
press's
wet
dream,
like
Bobby
and
Whitney,
Nate,
hit
me
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Soon
as
a
verse
starts
I
eat
at
an
emcee's
heart
What
is
he
thinking?
How
not
to
go
against
me,
smart
And
it's
absurd
how
people
hang
on
every
word
I'll
probably
never
get
the
props
I
feel
I
ever
deserve
But
I'll
never
be
served,
my
spot
is
forever
reserved
If
I
ever
leave
Earth,
that
would
be
the
death
of
me
first
Cause
in
my
heart
of
hearts
I
know
nothing
could
ever
be
worse
That's
why
I'm
clever
when
I
put
together
every
verse
My
thoughts
are
sporadic,
I
act
like
I'm
an
addict
I
rap
like
I'm
addicted
to
smack
like
I'm
Kim
Mathers
But
I
don't
want
to
go
forth
and
back
in
constant
battles
The
fact
is
I
would
rather
sit
back
and
bomb
some
rappers
So
this
is
like
a
full-blown
attack
I'm
launching
at
'em
The
track
is
on
some
battling
raps,
who
want
some
static?
Cause
I
don't
really
think
that
the
fact
that
I'm
Slim
matters
A
plaque
and
platinum
status
is
whack
if
I'm
not
the
baddest
So...
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Till
the
roof
comes
off,
till
the
lights
go
out
Till
my
legs
give
out,
can't
shut
my
mouth
Till
the
smoke
clears
out,
am
I
high?
Perhaps
I'ma
rip
this
shit
till
my
bone
collapse
Until
the
roof
(until
the
roof)
The
roof
comes
off
(the
roof
comes
off)
Until
my
legs
(until
my
legs)
Give
out
from
(underneath
me)
I
will
not
fall,
I
will
stand
tall
Feels
like
no
one
can
beat
me
I
got
a
song
filled
with
shit
for
the
strong
willed
When
the
world
gives
you
a
raw
deal
Set
you
off
till
you
Scream,
piss
off,
screw
you
When
it
talks
to
you
like
you
don't
belong
Or
tells
you
you're
in
the
wrong
field
When's
something's
in
your
mitochondrial
'Cause
it
latched
on
to
you,
like
Knock
knock,
let
the
devil
in,
malevolent
As
I've
ever
been,
head
is
spinnin'
and
this
medicine
Screaming,
"L-l-l-let
us
in"
L-l-lick
like
a
salad
bowl,
Edgar
Allen
Poe
Bedridden,
shoulda
been
dead
a
long
time
ago
Liquid
Tylenol,
gelatin,
think
my
skeleton's
meltin'
Wicked,
I
get
all
high
when
I
think
I've
smelled
the
scent
Of
elephant
manure
Element
glue,
screw
it,
to
hell
with
it
I
went
through
hell
with
accelerance
and
blew
up
My-my-myself
again,
Volkswagen,
tailspin
Bucket
matches
my
pale
skin,
metal
in
Went
from
Hellmann's
and
being
rail
thin,
Filet-o-Fish
Scribbles
and
Olympics
'97
Freaknik
How
can
I
be
down?
Me
and
Bizarre
in
Florida
Proof's
room
slept
on
floor
in
the,
motel
then
Dr.
Dre
said,
"Hell
yeah"
And
I
got
his
stamp
like
a
pouch
card,
word
to
Mel-Man
And
I
know
they're
gonna
hate
but
I
don't
care,
I
Barely
could
wait
to
hit
them
with
the
snare
and
the
bass
Square
in
the
face,
this
fuckin'
world
better
prepare
to
get
laced
Because
they're
gonna
taste
my
Venom
(I
got
that)
Adrenaline
in
'em
(venom)
Not
knowing
with
'em
Never
gonna
slow
up
in
'em
Ready
to
step
in
momentum
Thinking
it's
time
to
go
get
'em
They
ain't
gonna
know
what
hit
'em
(When
they
get
bitten
with
the)
Venom
(I
got

Adrenaline
in
'em

Not

Never

Ready

'em
They
ain't

'em
(When
they
get

I
said
knock
knock,
let
the
devil
in
Shotgun
p-p-pellets
in
the
felt
pin
Cocked,
fuck
around
and
catch
a
hot
one
I-i-it's
evident
I'm
not
done
V-venomous,
the
thought
spun
like
your
web
and
you
just
caught
in
'em
Held
against
your
will
like
a
hubcap
or
a
mud
flap
Be
strangled
or
attacked
So
this
ain't
gonna
feel
like
a
love
tap
Eat
painkiller
pills,
fuck
a
blood
track
Like,
what's
her
name
at
the
wheel?
Then
a
cup
catch
up
Through
the
car
into
reverse
at
the
end
of
the
nut
ration
And
you
look
back
and
it's
just
mangled
steel
My
Mustang
and
Jeep
Wrangler
grill
With
the
front
smashed,
much
as
my
rear
for
the
assassin
Slim
be
the
combination
of
an
actual
kamikaze
and
Gandhi
Translation,
I
will
probably
kill
us
both
when
I
end
up
Backin'
into
ya
You
ain't
gonna
be
able
to
tell
what
the
fuck's
happened
End
of
ya,
when
you're
bit
with
the
Venom
(I
got
that)
Adrenaline
in
'em
(venom)
Not
knowing
with
'em
Never
gonna
slow
up
in
'em
Ready
to

Thinking
it's

"Knock

in,

E-E-Elliot
phone
home,
ain't
no
telling
when
this
choke
hold
On
this
game
will
end,
I'm
loco
Became
a
symbiote,
so
My
fangs
are
in
your
throat,
ho
You're
steppin'
in
with
my
Venom
Put
the
ballpoint
pen
'em
Gun
cock,
bump
stock,
devil
eye,
buckshot
Tied
for
the
uppercut
Tie
a
couple
knots,
fired
up
and
caught
Fire
juggernaut
Punk
rock
bitches
going
down
like
Yung
Joc
'Cause
the
Doc
put
me
on
like
sunblock
Why
the
fuck
not?
You
only
get
one
shot
Ate
shit
till
I
can't
taste
it
Chased
it
with
straight
liquor
Then
bathe
in
'em
then
drank
till
I
faint
And
I
wait
with
a
headache
and
I
take
anything
in
Rectangular
shape,
then
I
wait
To
face
the
demons
I'm
bonded
to
'Cause
they're
chasing
me
but
I'm
part
of
you
So
escaping
me
is
impossible
I
latch
onto
you
like
a
Parasite,
and
I
probably
ruined
your
parents'
life
And
your
childhood
too
'Cause
if
I'm
the
music
that
y'all
grew
up
on
I'm
responsible
for
you
retarded
fools
I'm
the
supervillain
dad
and
mom
was
losin'
their
marbles
to
You
marvel
that?
Eddie
Brock

And
I'm
the
suit,
so
call
me
Venom

Ayo
Em,
you
ever
need
one
of
these
weapons
come
get
it
>From
now
on
every
beef
that
you
get
in
homie
I'm
in
it
I
been
ridin'
for
this
city,
whether
wrong
or
right
I
been
whippin'
on
mothafuckas
for
the
longest
time
So
its
evident,
its
time
for
Trick
to
get
it
fast
The
public,
see
they
appreciate
my
criminal
past
Authorities
tried
to
stop
me
but
they
couldn't
keep
up
Got
a
fanbase
thats
bigger
than
an
average
star
I'm
satisfied
with
it
bein'
my
time
to
shine
And
I
freak
from
the
precinct
for
violent
crimes
I
ain't
sayin'
the
shit
that
I'm
sayin'
so
girls
can
feel
me
Only
speakin'
on
what
I
know
so
the
world
can
hear
me
So
peace
to
Jimmy
and
Dre
for
signin'
my
nigga
He
reached
back
to
Detroit
and
grabbed
a
winner
So
the
gangstas
and
thugs,
we
embrace
the
love
And
beat
the
hell
outta
anyone
that
f***s
with
us
[

Eminem,
Wonder
boy,
Shady
It's
goin
down
baby
Ayo
Em
I
got
your
back
my
nigga
Damn
right
I
said
my
nigga
That's
my
nigga
Tricky
Yeah,
it's
my
life,
my
own
words
I
guess
Have
you
ever
loved
someone
so
much
You'd
give
an
arm
for
Not
the
expression,
no
Literally
give
an
arm
for
When
they
know
they're
your
heart
And
you
know
you
are
their
armor
And
you
will
destroy
anyone
who
would
try
to
harm
her
But
what
happens
when
karma
Turns
right
around
and
bites
you
And
everything
you
stand
for
turns
on
you
to
spite
you
What
happens
when
you
become
the
main
source
of
her
pain
"Daddy
look
what
I
made"
"Dad's
gotta
go
catch
a
plane"
"Daddy
where's
mommy?
I
can't
find
mommy,
where
is
she?"
"I
don't
know,
go
play,
Hailie
baby,
your
daddy's
busy
Daddy's
writing
a
song,
this
song
ain't
gon
write
itself"
I
give
you
one
underdog,
and
you
gotta
swing
by
yourself
Then
turn
right
around
in
that
song
and
tell
her
you
love
her
And
put
hands
on
her
mother
who's
the
spittin'
image
of
her
That's
Slim
Shady,
yeah
baby
Slim
Shady's
crazy
Shady
made
me
But
tonight,
Shady's
rock-a-bye
baby
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
I
keep
havin'
this
dream,
I'm
pushin'
Hailie
on
a
swing,
she
keeps
screamin',
she
don't
want
me
to
sing
"You're
makin'
mommy
cry,
why,
why
is
mommy
cryin'"
"Baby,
daddy
ain't
leavin'
no
more,
Daddy
you're
lyin'
You
always
say
that,
you
always
say
this
is
the
last
time
But
you
ain't
leavin'
no
more
daddy,
you're
mine"
She's
pilin'
boxes
in
front
of
the
door
tryin'
to
block
it
"Daddy
please,
daddy,
don't
leave,
daddy,
no,
stop
it"
Goes
in
her
pocket,
pulls
out
a
tiny
necklace
locket
It's
got
a
picture,
"This
will
keep
you
safe
daddy,
take
it
with
ya"
I
look
up,
it's
just
me
standin'
in
the
mirror
These
fuckin'
walls
must
be
talkin',
'cause
man
I
can
hear
'em
They're
sayin',
"you
got
one
more
chance
to
do
right
And
it's
tonight,
now
go
out
and
show
em
that
you
love
'em
before
it's
too
late"
And
just
as
I
go
to
walk
out
of
my
bedroom
door
It
turns
to
a
stage,
they're
gone
and
the
spotlight
is
on
and
I'm
singin'
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
Sixty
thousand
people
all
jumpin'
out
their
seat
The
curtain
closes,
they're
throwin'
roses
at
my
feet
I
take
a
bow,
and
thank
you
all
for
comin
out
They're
screamin'
so
loud,
I
take
one
last
look
at
the
crowd
I
glance
down,
I
don't
believe
what
I'm
seein'
"Daddy,
its
me,
help
mommy,
her
wrists
are
bleedin'"
But
baby
we're
in
Sweden
How
did
you
get
to
Sweden?
"I
followed
you
daddy
You
told
me
that
you
weren't
leavin'
You
lied
to
me
dad,
and
now
you
made
mommy
sad
And
I
bought
you
this
coin,
it
says
number
one
dad
That's
all
I
wanted,
I
just
want
to
give
you
this
coin"
"I
get
the
point,
fine,
me
and
mommy
are
goin'"
"But
baby
wait,
it's
too
late
dad,
you
made
your
choice
Now
go
out
there
and
show
em
that
you
love
em
more
than
us
That's
what
they
want
They
want
you,
Marshall
They
keep
screamin'
your
name
It's
no
wonder
you
can't
go
to
sleep
Just
take
another
pill,
yeah
I
bet
you
you
will!
You
rap
about
it,
yeah
word,
kid
keep
it
real"
I
hear
a
applause,
all
this
time
I
couldn't
see
How
could
it
be,
that
the
curtain
is
closin'
on
me
I
turn
around,
find
a
gun
on
the
ground
Cock
it,
put
it
to
my
brain,
scream
Die
Shady!
And
pop
it
The
sky
darkens,
my
life
flashes
The
plane
that
I
was
supposed
to
be
on,
crashes,
and
burns
to
ashes
That's
when
I
wake
up
Alarm
clock's
ringing,
there's
birds
singin'
It's
spring
and
Hailie's
outside
swingin'
I
walk
right
up
to
Kim
and
kiss
her
tell
her
I
miss
her
Hailie
just
smiles
and
winks
at
her
little
sister
almost
as
if
to
say
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't
feel
a
thing
so
baby,
don't
feel
no
pain,
just
smile
back
And
when
I'm
gone
just
carry
on
don't
mourn,
Rejoice
every
time
you
hear
the
sound
of
my
voice,
just
know
that,
I'm
lookin'
down
on
you
smilin'
And
I
didn't

baby,
don't
feel
no

just
